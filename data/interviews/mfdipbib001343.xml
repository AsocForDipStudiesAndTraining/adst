                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born, and tell me something about
                        your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was born on December 11, 1936 in Boston, Massachusetts, where my
                    father was a student of theology at Boston University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people in your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was the first born, and I have twin brothers who were born about
                    five years later. When I was less than a year old, my father finished his
                    studies and was assigned to a Methodist Church in Brecksville, Ohio. We all
                    moved West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would not be the easiest of times in the middle of the
                        depression. Where did you grow up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: My first memories are in the little town of Millersberg, Ohio. The
                    Pennsylvania Dutch country of Ohio, during the Second World War. I think I can
                    remember Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: My father was the son of a Methodist preacher in Ohio, various places
                    in Ohio. My mother was the daughter of a Methodist preacher in Massachusetts.
                    They met as students at Ohio Wesleyan University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like in Millersberg?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Gosh, that is hard. I don't remember much and moved not too long after
                    that. I remember living in a big house across the street from the church. I
                    remember some of the thoughts of the war, and I do have memories of or at least
                    heard stories of, the fact that it was an Amish area and there were troubles in
                    the town because Amish people spoke German, and didn't serve in the war. I can
                    remember some tales of discomfort and worry about that. I also remember a very
                    funny incident: when somebody got it into their head that somebody had poisoned
                    the water tower and that it had probably been a German agent of some sort. The
                    police went around town knocking on doors in the middle of the night and telling
                    everyone to boil all their water. It turned out there were kids up there trying
                    to paint “Class of 1943”or whatever it waon the water tower.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We moved to Wadsworth, Ohio. I remember the Normandy invasion very
                    clearly, and that it happened while we were still living in Millersberg. I
                    remember the death of FDR in terms of Wadsworth. So we must have moved in the
                    summer of 1944. We stayed there until junior high school when we moved to
                    Norwalk, Ohio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Wadsworth, where you went to school. What was
                        school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: You know, I don't have very strong memories of school days. Except
                    that I remember I didn't do well in the third grade. That may still have been in
                    Millersberg. I remember I didn't do well, and I also remember not doing well in
                    the first grade and having some problems with reading, so my grandmother came
                    (who was an old time school teacher), and taught me by very traditional methods.
                    My father claims she used a McGuffy reader. Somehow she made me break through on
                    reading. I do have this memory of standing up in front of the class and being
                    able to read for the first time. I had not been able to do it before. Wadsworth
                    - it's hard to dredge up memories. I remember being in the safety patrol, and
                    having the flag that you held down, and keeping kids from crossing the street.
                    That's probably a key to my character. As I said, I remember the death of
                    Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I can remember that I was in the backyard of the
                    house throwing a ball up on the roof of the garage and when it would roll back
                    down the roof I would catch it in my baseball glove. That doesn't mean I ever
                    became a good baseball player.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a sore example of a preacher's kid, or did you
                        stay out of trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, no, I can remember getting in trouble every now and then, but I
                    didn't get into serious trouble. I've known a lot of preacher's kids in my life,
                    and some of them were absolutely terrible and others became preachers. I was
                    sort of in the middle.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? Was religion a big thing as far as you
                        were concerned? What did you talk about at the dinner table?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Church was a big thing in the sense it was the center of my father's
                    life and we were expected to go to church. So I spent a lot of time in church,
                    and in church youth groups. Fortunately I learned early on that I liked to sing
                    in the choir, which gave me a church activity that I liked doing. Otherwise it
                    would have been more difficult. I can remember being proud of my father's
                    position and liking part of it. Preacher's kids grow up in a funny way. You
                    don't have a lot of money. On the other hand, you are very much a part of the
                    upper class of the town. There are economic tensions in families, often, because
                    you have to maintain a respectable middle class lifestyle without necessarily
                    having the money to do it. In my father's case, he was usually furnished with
                    pretty nice houses in pretty nice parts of town. Preaching may have been a
                    better deal back then than now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about when you were getting up to junior high? Your
                        grandmother got you to read. Did you read much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, reading was important. I can't remember in Wadsworth, but when I
                    entered seventh grade we moved to the town of Norwalk, Ohio, which is really the
                    place I consider my home town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Norwalk located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Norwalk is just south of Sandusky; it is to the west of Cleveland on
                    old route 20. It is a very old town, part of what is known as the Western
                    Reserve of Ohio, which was</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many people came from Connecticut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Connecticut and Massachusetts, mainly Connecticut, which is why it is
                    named Norwalk. There is a tiny little town named New Haven right nearby. You
                    mentioned reading. I remember the city library was just across a couple of back
                    lots from our house, and I spent a lot of time there. Not only with books, but
                    when LP records first came out, they began to stock LP records in the library
                    and I was able to borrow them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your interests by the time you were in junior
                        high and high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: In junior high and high school I was interested in reading. I think I
                    was in Boy Scouts for awhile and liked camping. I was interested in model
                    building, wasn't much good at sports, although I played tennis a lot. Not much
                    into team sports. Kind of interested in the social life of the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found that two of the subjects a good number of officers
                        whom I interviewed majored in, in high school, were girls and sports.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I wasn't into the sports thing. Also at that time, beginning in
                    1945, I began to spend summer vacations in New Hampshire where my mother's
                    parents had a place. We could take a month off a year and drive to New
                    Hampshire, which was an awful drive in those days. It took two days on old Route
                    29, mainly a two lane blacktop. My grandfather himself had built a summer
                    cottage right on a pristine lake on the New Hampshire Maine border. Up there we
                    spent a lot of time boating and fishing, especially fishing. Lakes and boats
                    became a big part of my life. I'm still a pretty avid amateur sailor.</p>
                <p>I have two strong New Hampshire memories of the end of the Second World War. My
                    grandfather had a cottage. Another older preacher had a cottage just to the left
                    of ours, and an old man who wrote children's books for a living to the right of
                    ours. I remember when the atomic bomb was dropped, my father, grandfather, and
                    the old preacher who lived to the left of us were walking on the beach, and
                    saying in effect, “We aren't any better than the Germans at this point. We
                    aren't any better than the Japanese. We aren't any better than they are. This
                    was a terrible, unnecessary thing. We had this war won anyway.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was August 1945.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: And I remember the end of the war in that same vacation period. It was
                    funny because communications weren't so good up there. We didn't have
                    electricity yet, so the only way to get any news was to go out at noon and start
                    the car and sit in it. I remember sitting there with my father and grandfatheit
                    was hoso we could listen to the car radio and get the news from WBZ in Boston.
                    We knew the end was coming. In the evenings as usual, we went out fishing.
                    Fishing was food during those vacations. Grocery stores were far away and I
                    suppose it saved ration stamps. While we were fishing up a river that emptied
                    into the lake, we heard church bells start to ring from two or three little
                    towns and realized that must have meant the end of the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>At the same time, when we were spending a month in New Hampshire, we would spend
                    about a week at a place called Lakeside in Ohio, which is on Lake Erie, which is
                    on old Chautauqua style resort that had its origins in Methodist camp meetingMy
                    father's job would require at least a week a year there, and my other
                    grandparents had a cottage there. That place was also kind of important to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain for the listener what the Chautauqua
                        system was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Lakeside started as a camp meeting place, and that is the old
                    Methodist tradition that goes back to the Ohio frontier. It fairly quickly
                    allied itself with the Chautauqua movement, which started in Chautauqua, New
                    York at the Chautauqua Institution. The idea was to bring culture and education
                    to the countryside, to the small towns in the United States. People would go to
                    a resort in the summer and sign on for a week or a month, and they were
                    guaranteed there would be an uplifting, or educational, or entertaining program
                    every night at some kind of an auditorium. And there would be other facilities.
                    This one at Lakeside, where I now own a cottage and spend three months every
                    summer on Lake Erie, still operates as a full blown Chautauqua. You pay an
                    admission fee to live there and either rent or own your cottage and in return
                    for that you get to go to the auditorium every night if you want to. It has a
                    pretty good residential symphony orchestra and some other things going for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of our colleagues here goes to Chautauqua, New York
                        every year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, Lakeside is sort of a cut rate Chautauqua. It's a lot cheaper
                    than the one in New York, and its entertainment tends to be sort of off the
                    “Prairie Home Companion” circuit rather than New York concert halls. On the
                    other hand, the boating on Lake Erie is infinitely superior to anything you can
                    do on Lake Chautauqua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to high school in Norwalk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Norwalk was a pretty classical, pleasant, small town, perhaps a bit on
                    the prosperous side. County seat, insular, smug, but with decent standards. The
                    high school was okay. The library was pretty good. Norwalk thought of itself as
                    a Western Reservkind of cut above some of the other towns in the area. Those
                    were times when indeed the world intruded. It was the period of the Korean War.
                    The world wouldn't leave people alone in towns like that. It was the post Edward
                    R. Murrow erwhen the radio was insistently knocking at your door and bringing
                    the world in. I can think of times when the world intruded in the sense of
                    beginning to stimulate my interest. Maybe this is a good thing to talk about. I
                    remembegoing back to Wadsworthaving a Jewish kid as a frienand remembering the
                    foundation of the State of Israel. That was around '48. This kid told me about
                    how he wanted to go fight for the State of Israel. I remember thinking, “What
                    kind of a business is this? This is really weird, sitting here in Ohio, and
                    Arnie says he wants to go fight for Israel.” I also remember being at his house
                    at the founding of the United Nations and his folks having it on the radio. We
                    were pursuing a hobby we had together, which was electric trains. I remember we
                    were down in the basement fiddling with a train layout and on the radio was the
                    foundation of the United Nations. Right after the war, too, I remember havinno,
                    not right afteprobably around '48, maybe '49, a kid came from Germana girto
                    visit our school and the church. I spent a lot of time talking to her and
                    getting kind of interested.</p>
                <p>Then there was the church and missionaries. When I was very young an old Bishop
                    of the Methodist Church named Smith who had been a missionary in India. He must
                    have been an old style missionary because he used to tell me tales about hunting
                    tigers. I don't think there are many missionaries left in the world who hunt
                    tigers. Maybe the world is poorer for that. But he hunted tigers, and I remember
                    he had a missing finger. I always thought probably a tiger got it. Maybe that
                    stimulated an interest in me for overseas adventure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in high school? Do you recall any of the books
                        that were influential in your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I don't think I was reading books on foreign affairs at that time.
                    If books were influential, it would have been more novels. I can remember an
                    attraction for novels that were set in other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any novelthrough Nordhoff and Hall or
                        Kenneth Roberts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, sure, absolutely. Kenneth Roberts and The Bounty Trilogy, but that
                    is all sailing stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Swallows of Amansville, did you ever read those?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, no. I'm trying to think of books that were interesting
                    politically. Early oGeorge Orwell in high school. In 1984, the Animal Farm, and
                    Koestler's Darkness at Noon. How I got into that I don't remember but I read
                    them in high school. But, I don't remember being influenced towards the foreign
                    service until I got to college.</p>
                <p>Q: You probably didn't know what it was. This certainly wasn't something that was
                    high on anybody's agenda.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think what does happen, though, for people that grow up in academic
                    and preachers' families is that they are not really motivated toward the world
                    of business. People don't talk about it. When my father would talk about things
                    at home, he would be talking about the church more often than not, the politics
                    and administrative problems of the church, rather than the high issues of
                    theology.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about missionaries? This is more of an outreach from
                        your background than from a lot of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think that's true. I remember a family in New Hampshire who were
                    missionaries to China. I think their name was Harley. They had a couple of boys
                    older than me. Good athletes, attractive, fun to be around, and they had all
                    come back from China. I remember admiring them. What I don't remember is them
                    ever telling me anything about China. I can remember the mother saying good bye
                    to these boys. Leaving them at college and she was going back to China. My
                    parents talked about what a hard thing that must be to do. That mother realized
                    she wouldn't see her boys for another four or five years. I can remember other
                    people from China staying at our house overnight. I can remember at church
                    camps, hearing lectures about going to work to help missionaries in Latin
                    America. I remember one particularly absurd happening where one of the
                    lecturers, naive in a way that that you sometimes find among church people,
                    telling the boys, “Now if you go down there you know you have to be very careful
                    with the girls because they have easier standards of sexual behavior.” You can
                    imagine all those teen age boys thinking, “Sounds like the place for me.”</p>
                <p>Q: When you graduated from high school, did you have any idea of what you wanted
                    to do? Baseball player, or president of the United States, or were you just
                    interested in going to the university or college?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I had been elected to class offices in high school so maybe I had a
                    beginning interest in politics. There were probably the seeds of an interest in
                    government at that point. I certainly knew what I didn't want to do. I didn't
                    want to be a doctor, lawyer, or preacher. I knew I wanted to go to college. I
                    probably knew even then my interests were tending toward the liberal arts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I went to Wesleyan - not Ohio Wesleyan - but to the one in
                    Connecticut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I went to Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Did you really? That led to a running family joke for years. Since my
                    parents, and others in the family, went to Ohio Wesleyan, I have always referred
                    to Wesleyan as the “Real Wesleyan.” They insist on calling it “Connecticut
                    Wesleyan.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Wesleyan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know. My parents were interested in it, and I have no idea who
                    first suggested it. Ohio Wesleyan was an obvious application as waDePauw
                    University, where my maternal grandfather had gone. A scholarship was a primary
                    consideration. I had done pretty well in high school. As it turned out, Wesleyan
                    offered a much better scholarship package than either Ohio Wesleyan or
                    DePauw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also have a feeling that you wanted to get out of
                        the Ohio Valley and see more of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, that did appeal to me. I had a friend from high school who was a
                    year older than I was who had gone to Trinity. Actually I didn't really live in
                    the Ohio Valley, but in the North, near the shore of Lake Erie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Wesleyan from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: From '54 to '58.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Wesleyan like then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was a wonderful place. Unlike some people, I have very positive
                    memories of my undergraduate years. Wesleyan was a great place at that time. It
                    only had 800 students. It was a men's school, with a very strong fraternity
                    system that had been totally integrated into the school. Fraternities were the
                    working housing, feeding and social units of the school and really didn't behave
                    like the fraternities at big time schools at all. I enjoyed the life there; I
                    had great teachers; I eventually ended up doing a tutorial and honors thesis
                    with Carl Schorske. (Carl E. Schorske: Professor Emeritus of History at
                    Princeton. Taught at Wesleyan in the fifties. Author of Pulitzer prize winning
                    Fin de siecle Vienna.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: History. History with a lot of English Lit. I was a very thorough
                    history major, except that I read a lot of novels and tended to write papers
                    along the line oHow Pride and Prejudice can teach you more about England than
                    reading history, which I still believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did the same using Gilbert and Sullivan. I was a history
                        major too. What fraternity were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Alpha Delta Phi. It was an interesting place at that time, and there
                    are very few people now who would understand how formative it was. Here were a
                    bunch of students who were given the right to manage their own lives. Cleaning
                    the house, feeding themselves, taking care of it, fundraising from alumni. I
                    think it was good training. Wesleyan's Alpha Delta Phi at that time was in a
                    very interesting stage. When I went in, the house leadership were Korean war
                    veterans. Very hard drinking, very hard studying, harplaying, disillusioned
                    people. They were disillusioned about everything but the academic life, but
                    studying, the life of the mind. They were very interesting persons. The
                    fraternity was interesting in that it was about half Jewish, and that was an
                    issue. It was the kind of place that instead of having a jazz concert on Sunday
                    afternoon, we figured out we could have a string quartet concert and attract as
                    many people or more than you would with a jazz concert. A lot of people were
                    into classical music. My interest in classical music had developed as a kid from
                    my mother and singing in all those choirs, but it really blossomed there because
                    there were a lot of people around me that were into it.</p>
                <p>There were of course some silly pseudo Masonic rituals left over from the
                    nineteenth century. They were carried out a basement room that had been gussied
                    up to look like a Magic Flute set. But the ceremonial stuff was rapidly
                    declining mainly because of brothers in the back row who were competing to
                    produce the loudest fart during solemn moments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In history, what areas were you interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: European history. Basically modern European history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time, the Korean War was just about over but the
                        Cold War was really going strong and we had the Suez crisis, and the
                        Hungarian revolt. Was that something people were keeping an eye on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That takes me back to pre college. I do have strong memories of
                    thinking how awful it was that, after the Second World War, Russithis big
                    country that everybody could like, that had been our allsuddenly in '47 and '48
                    becoming an enemy. How disillusioning this was. What a terrible thing this was.
                    I don't remember the fear of the atomic bomb that everybody says we all felt. I
                    don't remember feeling that, nor engaging in any “duck and cover” drills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't either. I'm eight years older than you are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember jumping under my desk at school. I do remember well
                    the beginning of the Korean War. There was almost a feeling of despair among
                    people we knew. I remember families in my father's church that had sons up
                    around the Chosan Reservoir, when the Chinese intervened in that awful first
                    winter of the war. We had church services that revolved around those events. I
                    guess growing up during the war, and then watching what we thought we had won go
                    bad, did influence me in terms of thinking foreign affairs were important. You
                    couldn't grow up during the period of the Second World War and not think that
                    America's relationship with the rest of the world was important. You had to
                    believe that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at colleg'54 to '58 periowere you feeling
                        or seeing any reactions to McCarthyism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I did not. I remember the McCarthy hearings when I was in high school
                    and my parent's reactions. Very strong anti McCarthy reactions. But I don't
                    remember much going on at Wesleyan. I think McCarthy had basically been broken
                    by then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I remember there was the beginning of a silly Left at Wesleyan at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of causes you were getting involved
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, there were causes. I worked on the college radio station and,
                    again, Israel came into my consciousness. I can remember working on the college
                    radio station during the '56 Suez War, and having a lot of mainly Jewish
                    students crowding into what we called the news rooit was a large closet with a
                    teletype in ito get the news hot off the ticker and read it. Again, I was very
                    conscious of America's engagement with Israel.</p>
                <p>And another interesting one: I remember sitting in a room in the fraternity house
                    with two naval officers from Argentina. They talked about the overthrow of Peron
                    in Argentina and I thought, “Wow, that is very interesting and what an
                    interesting place Argentina must be.” In my mind, I guess Latin America had been
                    sort of an endless string of Mexican border towns. I had very little idea of
                    place like Argentina where things happened on as large a scale as they did in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>And of course civil and minority rights issues were beginning to grow in
                    everyone's consciousness. In my sophomore year, the fraternity had a big fight
                    over whether to extend full membership to a hearing impaired student. Some
                    members, not without justification, found him obnoxious. Others of us felt that
                    to deny full membership to a handicapped pledge who had been with us for months
                    would reflect badly on the house. The fraternity had a “black ball” system which
                    meant that one member could veto any prospective member. We took secret vote
                    after secret vote and somebody kept dropping the black ball. Finally we were
                    faced with a large group of members who were threatening to resign if he were
                    not admitted to full membership. I finally proposed that we revise our bylaws in
                    a way that mooted the black ball system. That was done by majority vote. The
                    person in question was admitted and nobody resigned. A few months later, the
                    national organization of Alpha Delta Phi sent a representative to tell us we had
                    to reinstate the black ball system or risk our national accreditation. We told
                    him to stuff it. Nothing happened.</p>
                <p>The destruction of the black ball system turned out to be very important later
                    on. I had become president of the fraternity and we admitted our first black
                    member. I guess he was also the first black to be admitted nationally. He was an
                    outstanding student from the Midwest named Jim Thomas. It is important to
                    remember that fraternities are very dependent on alumni donations. We were
                    scared that our money might dry up, so I spent time on the phone talking with
                    big donors. Some of the biggest were very supportive and we did just fine.</p>
                <p>I was proud of what we did. Later on, in the late seventies I guess, the Wesleyan
                    chapter of Alpha Delta Phi became one of the first fraternities to admit women.
                    I guess the membership is now about half and half and I receive fundraising
                    letters from female chapter presidents. Instead o“brothers” they now refer to
                    each other as “siblings.” Good for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Wesleyan, what was the source of that
                        most important commoditdates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, Connecticut College, Mount Holyoke, I mean in terms of my personal
                    experience. Smith, even as far afield as Radcliffe, although you had to be able
                    to travel on the weekends. I dated a lot of girls but didn't end up marrying any
                    of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a history major, were you thinking about the future and
                        what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I was, and I spent a lot of time looking at European history and
                    ended up writing my thesis comparing Orwell and Huxley, the two, as I called
                    them, inverted utopias. I saw a new word the other dayou can call them
                    disutopias. But writing a thesis on that for Carl Schorske got me deeply into
                    European intellectual history of the early twentieth century. You can't spend
                    time with George Orwell without spending time with the Spanish Civil War and the
                    basic issues of war and peace and politics of the century. I suppose out of
                    those studies I became a pretty classic anti Communist of the period, except I
                    wasn't really. The Orwellian road to not liking the communists is not the
                    American way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pointed towards anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know when it started, but certainly by my senior year I was
                    convinced I wanted to go to graduate school in international studies, in foreign
                    affairs, which is what I eventually did. Beginning sometime in my junior year,
                    there was some idea that I might want to go into the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into anyone who had been in the foreign
                        service who could give you any information about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, not until graduate school. I don't remember thinking anywhere near
                    as much as I should have about what I was going to do for a living. I was
                    enjoying being an undergraduate. You get pretty good at it, and then they made
                    you quit. Like a lot of kids who like college, I thought about teaching for
                    awhile. But I just sort of slipped into graduate school because I didn't have a
                    career plan, thought that would be interesting, and got offered a fellowship
                    that made it possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to graduate school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I went to SAIS (The School of Advanced International Studies) which is
                    here in Washington but affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was at the Washington campus during the academic year '58 '59, and
                    then I went to the school's Bologna Center in Italy for '59 '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at SAIS, what was the spirit of the place?
                        Were these people who were going to get involved in Washington? Who were
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They were people who were headed for the foreign service or toward
                    employment in government agencies in the foreign affairs field. At that point,
                    SAIS was a big feeder for the foreign service, and especially a big feeder for
                    AID (Agency for International Development), or ICA (International Cooperation
                    Administration) as it was known at that time. There was a beginning interest in
                    people going into international business, and SAIS at that time was doing some
                    very heavy fund raising along those lines. Some people also did that. But it was
                    very much oriented toward going into somebody's foreign service, whether it was
                    the U.S. government or some multinational corporation. That is pretty much what
                    happened to the people I went to SAIS with.</p>
                <p>As to who went there, I remember noticing later when I was serving in Israel and
                    we were very involved with our embassy colleagues in Egypt, that both
                    Ambassadors and both of the heads of USIS were SAIS graduates.</p>
                <p>Felix Bloch who was later accused of espionage was also there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling the faculty and student body were
                        any particular part of the political spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: More to the liberal side of center. Again, you weren't yet into the
                    period of political polarization. This is pre Kennedy. I don't remember heavy
                    politicization, neither as an undergraduate nor a graduate student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at SAIS here in Washington, what sort of
                        courses were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I followed a course of Western European area studies. I did one year
                    in Western Europe, but since then I have had very little to do with Western
                    Europe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to this point you had never been abroad, had you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I had not. I had been to Canada once and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a considerable yearning to get out and see the
                        world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, absolutely, I was very anxious to do that. Had I not gone to
                    graduate school, I think I would probably have joined the navy. (End of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>What was fun about being in Bologna was that it was Bologna. Academically, I
                    don't think it was a particularly enriching experience. My undergraduate years
                    were better academically than graduate school was. But being there was the most
                    important thing, and being part of a student body that was half European at that
                    time. That had huge advantages in terms of cultural enrichment and getting used
                    to simply living in and with foreign cultures. It also had a big academic
                    advantage in that the common language was English, and my English was better
                    than theirs. Most American students in Bologna in those days could coast a
                    little bit academically. And we did have some time to see things. I lived in an
                    apartment with an Italian, a German, and an Austrian. We hired a maid to cook
                    for us, and went to classes (which I don't remember very well). One of them was
                    in a classroom that was so old that Dante could have studied there and it was
                    cold. My memories are of being in Italy and having time to travel a bit. I
                    remember very clearly going to Berlin and getting my picture taken in front of
                    the Brandenburg Gate, which was THE place to have your picture taken in those
                    days. That was where all the correspondents stood with their mikes on
                    television. Academically, the biggest problem was that I had to pass a fairly
                    tough language requirement, because I came in with German as an undergraduate.
                    So I had to keep studying German and working at it pretty hard, even when I was
                    at Bologna. At Bologna I was still studying German in order to pass a language
                    requirement to get my masters degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a feel for the politics of Italy? Did it
                        sharpen your observation skills?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, yes, absolutely. I was also studying the politics of Germany at
                    the time. I think in terms of courses that were influential to me, the one I
                    really liked the best was a sort of trade craft course. It was taught by a
                    senior Italian diplomat. It was really a good course. He, for the first time,
                    began to give me a feeling of how embassies worketradecrafthe mechanics of
                    foreign affairs. I thought it was a useful course and it did pique my
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you made application to take the foreign service

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I took the foreign service exam in Florence, Italy, and then took the
                    orals back in Washington and didn't pass them. I don't remember exactly when,
                    but it was some time after I had returned from Italy and before I actually went
                    into the Navy.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions that were asked at that
                        oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I can remember a question I bobbled. They were sort of American
                    government questions, such as how many justices are on the Supreme Court. One of
                    them I bobblesomebody wanted to know the relationship between Wagner and Hitler.
                    In trying to give a complicated and sophisticated answer about an issue which I
                    knew a great deal about, both Hitler and Wagner, I gave the impression I didn't
                    think there was much of a relationship. I think the person thought I was kind of
                    dumb. What I was trying to say was, you can't blame Wagner for Hitler.
                    Basically, they said, “You're not ready yet.” And the question of my military
                    eligibility had come up, and I knew I was vulnerable. They sort of said, “Go do
                    your military service and then try again.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your military service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I got back from Bologna and went home to Ohio to find a draft notice
                    waiting for me in the mail. Obviously, they were going to draft me. So I called
                    the draft board and said, “Give me some more time because I want to try to get a
                    commission.” I had known a couple of people at Wesleyan who were going into the
                    Navy OCS (Officer Candidate School), and one of them had come back to visit and
                    said he was enjoying it. I had this interest in boats, water, so basically I
                    said fine, I'll go into the Navy for three years or whatever it was. Eventually,
                    I was accepted in the OCS program, but there was a delay and I was stuck in
                    Ohio. One day I got really tired of it, got on a bus and went down to
                    Washington. I was wandering around town trying to figure out how to get a job. I
                    walked by the Democratic National Headquarters. It was the beginning of the
                    Kennedy campaign; I went in and said, “Can you give me a job?” He said, “Okay,
                    you're a messenger. Sixty five dollars a week, take it or leave it.” I took it.
                    In the meantime I got together with some friends and we rented an apartment that
                    we could afford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the spirit of the campaign? Could you talk
                        about your experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: A lot of it was errand running, taking things from one person to
                    another, but it got to be pretty important, at least to me. I remember spending
                    time in an office with Paul Butler (ex Democratic National Chairman), and he
                    wasn't real busy, but I went to his law office and he spent a lot of time
                    talking. I remember riding around with Sergeant Shriver, and not being sure of
                    who the hell he was. I took drafts of speeches over to Mrs. Kennedy in
                    Georgetown. I was told by people in Pierre Salinger's office that my job was to
                    get her to look at them. And failing. I remember going over there once and
                    having Mrs. Kennedy come bounding down the stairs with a towel around her head
                    and a bathrobe on. She had just washed her hair. She thanked me but wasn't much
                    interested in the speech. She made it clear she was willing to read it but that
                    was about it. I delivered to her a package, a gift from somebody. She opened it
                    and there were these little doily type things you put on the arm of a chair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Antimacassar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Antimacassar, yes. And she said, “These are awful, do you want them?”
                    I said, “No thanks.” Then I thought as I was taking a cab back to headquarters,
                    “She shouldn't say things like that.” Then I guess sort of breakthrough came
                    when somebody had given me a latter that had come out of a box called
                    “nationalities,” in this big complex that was basically the public affairs
                    office of the DNC. Somebody had looked at it and said, “I think the signature
                    says Adenauer.” It was a letter from Konrad Adenauer that had been dropped in
                    this box and ignored. Somebody said, “Take it to the Library of Congress, get it
                    translated and then take it to the DNC chairman's office. In the cab on the way
                    over I could read enough German to realize it was a request to send some members
                    of the Bundestag to the campaign to observe the last days of the campaign. I
                    thought, “I don't have to take this to the Library of Congress, I can take it
                    straight to the chairman's office.” I did, and they said yes, but the upshot of
                    it was nobody really wanted to pay any attention to these Germans in the last
                    days of the campaign, so they asked me to sort of be their escort. This was
                    based on the idea that I could speak German, which I really couldn't, but that
                    did not become necessary. It got me into a lot of events that perhaps I wouldn't
                    have gotten into otherwise.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes campaigns have a spirit of their own. Did you
                        pick up a feeling of mobilizing of younger America as a new generation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, absolutely; it was really exciting. It was a whole lot of fun.
                    Kennedy was a new generation, and he was very close to our generation. That old
                    thing about Kennedy attracting people into governmenabsolutely true. The United
                    States did have something to teach the rest of the world and we ought to teach
                    it. I don't think I ever saw John Kennedy during the campaign. I remember I saw
                    Bobby Kennedy once, who barked at me because his car wasn't where it was
                    supposed to be. It wasn't my job to get it there. I remember sort of a blur, to,
                    of just running around and being in the Mayflower or whatever hotel it was when
                    he won. And being offered a job afterwards. I was sent over to Harrison
                    Williams' office and offered a job as a something or other aide, working in the
                    congressman's office. I had to say no because the Navy had me scheduled to show
                    up in Newport, Rhode Island, in January. I have often wondered what would have
                    happened if I had gone to work on the Hill instead of joining the navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the navy from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was in the navy from January 1961. I spent four months at Newport.
                    When I took my physical the summer before, they discovered I was partially color
                    blind. This meant I would not end up on the bridge of a destroyer in the North
                    Atlantic; I was going to end up in the supply corps of the navy. I had a choice
                    of either the supply corps or naval intelligence, and navy intelligence would
                    have required me to waste a lot of time with increased security clearances and
                    delay another six months. So I went to Newport for basic officer training, spent
                    four months there, then went to Athens, Georgia, for six months as a
                    commissioned officer for training in supply and logistics, personnel management
                    and all the other stuff supply people are supposed to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after your training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Remember, I joined the navy because I really wanted to serve on a
                    ship. In the first place, I was too color blind to serve up on the bridge where
                    it really counts. Secondly, I'm one of the few persons in my class that got sent
                    to shore duty. The navy was full of people who were ready to quit because they
                    couldn't stand life on a ship, and I wanted to be there but I got shore duty. I
                    went to the Naval Air Facility in Okinawa as the disbursing officer. If there is
                    anything I never thought I would be in my life, it was to be the person in
                    charge of all the accounting of a pretty good size activity. I went out there as
                    the disbursing officer, an ensign in the supply corps of the U.S. Navy. In the
                    first place, I found myself overseas; we ran Okinawa in those days but it was
                    Japan's. Almost everybody who worked for me was either Okinawan mainland
                    Japanese, or Filipino. I basically ended up with a bunch of third country
                    national employees working for me. At that, time the supply corps ratings in the
                    navy on the enlisted side were heavily manned by Filipinos who had come into the
                    U.S. Navy as steward's mates. These persons had worked their way up from being
                    waiters in officer's wardrooms into the supply ranks because it didn't require a
                    high security clearance. In my disbursing office, I had about nine people
                    working there running comptometer machines. Out of those, one was a mainland
                    Japanese, one was an Okinawan, one was a skinny, middle western American. The
                    rest were Filipinos, including my senior assistant. It was fun working overseas
                    and it was fun supervising people from another country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it make you nervous being responsible for a lot of
                        money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember being nervous about it. I suppose that is testimony
                    that the training in Athens was really pretty good. I think the U.S. military is
                    very good at training. You came out of the school in Athens, Georgia, thinking
                    you knew enough to do the job. I'm not naturally careful and painstaking, so I
                    had to make myself be careful. We were disbursing a hell of a lot of money. I
                    was probably signing by hand something like 1200 checks every two weeks. All I
                    accounted for was the money. I was the paymaster. I didn't decide what to buI
                    just made sure that the procedures had been followed and that the bills were
                    paid on time. At the same time, I also supervised the mess hall; that didn't
                    require a lot of supervision. I sat on a lot of courts martial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get around Okinawa and Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, a lot. Well in the first place, I met my wife after a few months
                    there. We were introduced by mutual friends. She was a draftsman in the office
                    that planned and built new PXs (Post Exchange). She was from Okinawa, but had
                    recently returned from two years of architectural studies in Japan. Her father a
                    very prominent architect. My first few months there, my off time was mostly
                    spent with navy buddies. The second half of my year and a half tour was pretty
                    much dominated by Keiko and my courtship of her.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did a cultural courtship work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Hard! It takes a lot of work. In the first place, you have language
                    difficulties. She had English but had never had much practice. I had no
                    Japanese, so we had to work a lot on that. It requires a lot of time and
                    patience. She learned English and my Japanese remained primitive, to say the
                    least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about her family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I met them early on. They were nice people. They were probably trapped
                    like my family eventually wabetween what they thought was a good idea and what
                    they had taught their kids to believe. Her father was a modern kind of person.
                    Keiko used to say, “My father is the only person I know that thinks the emperor
                    is a waste of money and should be fired.” That was a very unusual thing for a
                    Japanese to believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say “Japanese”, was your wife's family Japanese or
                        Okinawan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Okinawan, but you know, that's an interesting bit of history. It's
                    very complicated. Japan took over Okinawa in the late 1860s and it was a no
                    nonsense kind of occupation, in the sense that they said, “You are Japanese now
                    and school in Japanese starts tomorrow.” American policy, after the Second World
                    War, found it convenient to emphasize the cultural differences of Okinawa and
                    treat Okinawa as an independent country that had been liberated from Japan. It
                    was not an absurd policy stance; it was just overly influenced by wartime
                    propaganda, by genuine sympathy for all that Okinawan civilians had suffered
                    during the battle, and at least a half century out of date. The Ryukyuan
                    monarchy Japan overthrew had sustained centuries of relative independence by
                    playing off, one against the other, the two regional superpowers, Japan and
                    China. Okinawans became very good at sustaining their own cultural values, of
                    which they are still very proud, while paying necessary tribute to the powers
                    that were. I think there was probably a sort of generation gap which probably
                    persists even today. Older people tended to embrace traditional cultural values,
                    idealize the old days, and mistrust the authorities up north. Younger people
                    with dreams and careers to pursue admired the dynamism of Meiji Japan.</p>
                <p>The fact is, certainly by the 1930s if not earlier, most Okinawans considered
                    themselves to be a loyal citizens of the Japanese empire. While they suffered
                    social prejudice and economic discrimination on the part of mainlanders, they
                    also enjoyed the full rights of Japanese citizenship. Okinawans served with
                    distinction in the Japanese military, even in some senior positions. Whatever
                    doubts they had about the military government and the war were probably similar
                    to those of mainlanders.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So, in a sense we were kidding ourselves that we had liberated an independent
                    country called Okinawa. The truth was we maintained an occupation regime in the
                    islands until 197almost a quarter century after World War II occupations ended
                    elsewhere. Tokyo's attitude was also complex. While continued occupation was a
                    kind of national embarrassment, the American security umbrella was a great
                    convenience and money saver. I don't think the successive Liberal Democratic
                    governments were particularly interested in getting Okinawa back. Besides, U.S.
                    governments were particularly helpful in coming up with face saving formulas.
                    Early on we recognized that our occupation was temporary and that Japan held
                    residual sovereigntwhatever that iover the islands. We also recognized that
                    Okinawans were Japanese citizens. If an Okinawan were to go to the mainland, he
                    could get a Japanese passport which would be recognized by U.S. consular and
                    immigration authorities. If he were to travel directly from Okinawa, he could
                    use a U.S. Civil Administration, Ryukyus (USCAR) document called something like
                    Identification Document in Lieu of a Passport. It also worked although it was,
                    of course, much less recognizable in countries other than the U.S.</p>
                <p>At the beginning, in the wake of that horrible battle that killed more Okinawan
                    civilians than combatants on both sides, there was little opposition to the
                    occupation. People were traumatized by their own suffering and the defeat of
                    Japan, and we were pretty efficient in feeding and housing people. Besides, the
                    mainland was under occupation, too.</p>
                <p>Kiel's family was particularly connected to the mainland, because a lot of the
                    family lived there. There was never any doubt that they considered themselves
                    Okinawan in culture but Japanese in citizenship and loyalty. If you ask my wife
                    if she is Okinawan or Japanese, the question makes no sense. There are
                    differencein culture, cuisine and folklorbut Okinawans considered themselves
                    part of Japan. There were still people around that spoke the old Okinawan
                    dialect. Keiko can understand it but can't speak it. Her younger nieces and
                    nephews can't even understand it very welit is pretty much gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got married, was the foreign service still
                        something you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely, and it complicated things considerably. I finished my time
                    in the navy, finished my tour in Okinawa, and Keiko and I were engaged but both
                    of us thought a year apart would be a good testing period. Both of our families
                    knew of our intention and agreed. So I went on to my next assignment. I still
                    wanted to go to sea, but my next assignment was the Navy Security Station in
                    Washington, DC. They put me right in a town where it would make it easy for me
                    to look for a job. I worked in the supply department there. They had an
                    automation project that had gone sour and, if I contributed anything during that
                    year, it was getting computer types to talk to supply types. I realized quickly
                    they didn't speak the same language. I spent a lot of time as an interpreter
                    between two cultures.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Of course, I remember very well the death of Kennedy. I saw armed Marines running
                    by the window of my office and then the reports started coming in. I remember an
                    odd reactioafter his death was confirmed, there was silence and almost everybody
                    simply went back to work. It was as though they didn't know what else to do.
                    Keiko remembers her father waking her up to tell her the news and saying, “You
                    can't go to that country, it is a terrible place.”</p>
                <p>I suppose I had the same emotions everybody else had, but maybe a bit exaggerated
                    because I was living by myself. The next day was a day off work without a lot to
                    do. I remember wandering around Washington, and standing out in front of the
                    church during the funeral.</p>
                <p>When I finished with the Navwell, even before thaas I remember, and I think this
                    is accuratI could not retake the foreign service exam at that point because of
                    my intention to marry a foreign national. I talked to both State and USIA (U.S.
                    Information Agency) about that. USIA said, “Well, take the management intern
                    exam. It's a good job, you'll get the same pay, but you probably won't serve
                    overseas.” USIA had sort of been on my mind ever since graduate school. So I
                    took the management intern exam and was accepted by USIA. I asked when they
                    wanted me to start and they named a date. I said, “That is convenient. Now I
                    have to go to Okinawa and get married.” They said that was nice and they would
                    see me when I got back. I got on a plane (this was the first time I had to pay
                    for a ticket), and flew to Okinawa. We got married shortly after I got there, at
                    City Hall, but then there was a church wedding scheduled for July 20th. On the
                    morning of July 20th, 1964, somebody came from someplace and handed me a message
                    saying, “Please come to the Okinawa Relay Station of the Voice of America at
                    Chained Air Base.”</p>
                <p>I had time to get in a taxi and go out there. I didn't know what a relay station
                    did exactly but I found the place. I walked in and they said, “USIA wants to
                    know if you would be willing to go to work here, and we would like to interview
                    you.” I said, “Fine. I have a masters degree in foreign affairs.” They said “Who
                    cares? Do you know anything about supply or accounting or any of that?” And I
                    said, “Yes, right here in Okinawa up to a year ago I was disbursing officer down
                    at Naha Air Base.” They said, “That's fine, just what we need. Are you willing?”
                    I said, “I have to talk to my wife to be.” I did. It wasn't too hard to convince
                    Keiko that we might live there rather than in Washington. I went back and told
                    them, “Yes, if you will give my wife and me a trip back to the United States so
                    she can meet my parents. They said that was fine because I needed some training
                    anyway. So they sent me back to Washington.</p>
                <p>Keiko and I had a wonderful two months or so in the States. We moved into the
                    efficiency apartment I had rented while I was at the Security Station. I
                    reported for duty at the VOA engineering division, which was in the old tempos
                    (temporary buildings) on the mall.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>They had no idea how to train me so they have me a little office and a copy of
                    USIA's manual of operations and told me to read it. They also arranged
                    appointments for me to meet people involved in relay station administration,
                    which was helpful. The rest of my work time was taken up with all the necessary
                    in processing stuff and preparations for any overseas assignment. I think I had
                    to be first appointed as a civil servant and the re appointed as foreign service
                    staff. We also had time for basic sight seeing and a trip to Ohio to meet my
                    parents and brothers. We had a great time there, too.</p>
                <p>Then, in October, we went back to Okinawa. We were given a nice three bedroom
                    house on Kadena Air Base in a housing area shared by VOA, the American Consular
                    Unit (which was a consulate in all but name, and the CIA's Foreign Broadcast
                    Information Service (FBIS.) I settled into the job and we had a marvelous three
                    and a half years.</p>
                <p>The function of a relay station was to pick up VOA short wave signals from the
                    United States, transmit them by medium wave (AM) into China, the Soviet maritime
                    provinces, and North Korea. That meant we broadcast in five languageMandarin,
                    Russian, Korean plus a bit of Japanese and English. Imagine the size of that
                    transmittemedium wave, and million watts. I think 50,000 watts is the statutory
                    limit in the United States. This was a monster liberated from the Germans as a
                    war reparation. It stood behind glass in a space about the size of three ample
                    bedrooms and had vacuum tubes as tall as a small adult. We pumped gallons of sea
                    water to cool it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is the 26th of October 1999. Jeff, what are we up to? We are in Okinawa. Was
                    your job a different situation there?</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it was. Let me go back a little bit to the military service,
                    because I thought of some stuff over the past week. My duties were very routine
                    administrative duties and the better you ran the office, the quieter it was. All
                    you really had to do was keep the accounts straight and pay the bills on time.
                    However, there were collateral duties. They ended up being the most interesting
                    things I did in the navy.</p>
                <p>All officers had to stand communications watches. I drew duty on the crucial
                    night of the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. This meant standing duty in the
                    communications center, because only commissioned officers were permitted to
                    decrypt the most highly classified messages. The decryption machine used
                    adjustable rotors not unlike those I have seen in pictures of the famous German
                    enigma machine. It was a complicated machine to run. I remember standing a very
                    tense, nervous night thinking, “This is the night something is going to come in.
                    Then I am going to see if I really remember how to run that machine because
                    training was three months ago.” But nothing came in.</p>
                <p>Later I got tapped to sit on a court martial in a murder case. I had been on
                    courts martial before, and served as a defense attorney at one time, but minor
                    stufpetty thefts, drunkenness, general misbehavior. The Cobb case, however, was
                    a much different, and one of the first cases that attracted a lot of attention
                    in Okinawa. It was a precursor of some recent cases and involved the murder of
                    an Okinawan. This was a particularly sad case in that it should have been
                    avoidable. The defendant, Cobb, had been removed from a ship because of erratic
                    behavior, inexplicable behavior, and was in Okinawa waiting for transportation
                    back to the United States. He went out to a red light district one night, hooked
                    up with a prostitute and during the course of the evening he killed her. He beat
                    her to death with a bedside alarm clock. It was an awful case, covered heavily
                    in the Okinawan press. It was difficult because there had been signs in the past
                    that the person was a lunatic. But the old McNaughten rule came into play, and
                    the question became, “Was he so incapacitated that he could not distinguish
                    right from wrong?” He also had a very good defense attorney, Howard McClellan,
                    an ex Judge Advocate General type who had settled down in Okinawa and had taken
                    up the defense of service men in courts martial. We finally found him guilty and
                    sentenced him to 20 to 25 years. His sentence was somewhat light in this case,
                    because of suspicions on the part of the court martial board that the Navy had
                    somehow failed for not putting this person under restraint or something to keep
                    this from happening. Okinawans felt the sentence was way too light, and that he
                    would go back to the States and be incarcerated and somehow or other be
                    released. He served a good bit of his sentence.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was there in the navy for 18 months, from early '61 until mid
                    '63.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Then I went back and served at the Navy Security Station in
                    Washington, then ended up back in Okinawa as the Executive Officer for the relay
                    station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was there from '64 to the spring of '68. It was a fairly long tour.
                    We don't have the relay station anymore. It reverted to the Japanese government
                    when Okinawa was returned to the Japanese on the grounds that it was not a
                    defensive facility. It was closed up at that time and a lot of its duties taken
                    over by other relay stations. I don't know whether I covered it before or nothe
                    purpose of a relay station.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I did talk about that? Good. It was kind of fun because I was the only
                    non engineer there among the American personnel, which meant anything an
                    engineer didn't want to do (because it didn't have to do directly with
                    broadcasting), one way or another I either had to do or got to do. A lot of it
                    had to do with keeping the accounts straight, making sure people were paid,
                    making sure supplies were available, and running the supply system. The station
                    employed a lot of Okinawan civilians and some mainland Japanese civilians. In
                    the meantime, too, the political situation was getting a bit more difficult. I
                    think it was predictable that eventually the larger diplomatic interests of the
                    U.S., in terms of its relationship with Japan, would make the return of Okinawa
                    to Japan inevitable. On the other hand, if you talked to people who ran the
                    bases and to the Department of Defense people, it seemed unthinkable to them
                    that the United States would give up this marvelously located base, which indeed
                    it was, with all the advantages that attend to having effective sovereignty. The
                    larger U.S. attitude was interesting, in that we never really took over; from
                    the very beginning, for instance, education was in the Japanese language, and
                    although run by Americans, it was modeled on the Japanese system. That certainly
                    proved that we considered our tenure to be temporary. We early on recognized a
                    weird doctrine of residual sovereignty as far as Japan was concerned. They had
                    sovereignty but did not exercise it because they ceded administrative control to
                    the United States. The administration itself was sort of British Colonial in the
                    sense we never really wanted to run everything. We just wanted to control trade,
                    foreign relations, military bases, and a few other things that made life easy
                    for us. I remember one of my wife's family - either her father or her
                    cousisaying to me, “You persons should not be surprised if you give up this
                    place because you never really took it over. You never said to us 'We won, we
                    are here to stay, school begins in English tomorrow and eventually you are going
                    to be part of the United States.' “ Had we said that in 1945 when they were
                    reeling under the shock of the battle of Okinawa and feeling betrayed, perhaps
                    the Okinawans, and the mainlanders, would have accommodated themselves to a new
                    reality. Remember that as many as 150,00Okinawans were killed during the April
                    May 1945 battlmaybe as much as one third of the population. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>I was saying, I worked in a Quonset Hut when I was in the Navy, and I thought
                    that was symbolic of the nature of the U.S. administration therserviceable but
                    temporary. In the early days, we got pretty tough. In an early set of elections,
                    a member of the Japanese Communist Party was elected, I believe, to be the mayor
                    of Naha.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, the mayor of Naha was renowned, sort of in and
                        out all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, Kamejiro Senaga, and we in no uncertain terms made sure that
                    those elections did not count and he did not hold office. I think we even threw
                    him in jail for little while.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Back to the Voice of Americmost of the people were engineers, and they were an
                    interesting lot. I think understanding them makes it easier to understand the
                    attitude of the Voice of America right up to the present. They were proud of the
                    fact that they were probably the world's finest short wave broadcasting
                    engineers. There was nothing as good as the U.S. system of transmission, this
                    whole network they had set up. I think that explains, in a way, the reluctance
                    the Voice has shown to give up short wave over the years, no matter what other
                    technologies are available. These persons would rather have been, and would be,
                    known as the greatest short wave engineers, rather than just regular engineers
                    doing other kinds of broadcasting.</p>
                <p>Part of that also had to do with the fact that almost all the alternatives that
                    anyone came up with for the Voice of America made the Voice dependent upon
                    retransmission of their signals by other, presumably foreign, broadcasting
                    organizations. In other words, at that time, unless you built more megawatt
                    transmitters, the only way you could get on AM or FM was by getting some local
                    broadcaster to retransmit your signal. That meant you were counting on someone
                    else to deliver your message. That became sort of an anathema to the VOA
                    journalists and engineers. Almost anything would be sacrificed for independent
                    control of the signal. Actually, VOA was, and is, rebroadcast all the time,
                    usually through the efforts of local USIS posts. It always seemed to me that,
                    except in denied areas like China and the Soviet Union or real boondocks like
                    the Amazon, the only people who listened to short wave were either radio
                    hobbyists or political loonies usually on the right side of the spectruneither
                    of which rated very high on the U.S. government's list of priorities. If you
                    wanted VOA to be influential you had to have it on AM or FM at drive time in
                    major cities, which could be done if you were willing to trust your signal to
                    local broadcasters. VOA accepted that reality, but they fought like tigers to
                    protect their independent short wave signal.</p>
                <p>As for the rest of relay station life, it is hard to come up with exciting
                    moments on the job. Typhoons would blow down our towers and we would put them
                    back up. We had a staff of maybe a dozen engineerboth radio and power plant
                    typewho were directed by a station manager who was also an engineer. I was lucky
                    enough to have had two very good bosseJohn Rowlett and Jim Miller. The work was
                    pretty routine most of the time. We probably had another hundred Okinawan
                    employees, as well as a couple of mainland Japanese. They were great to work
                    with. Our main administrative support, interestingly enough, came form the U.S.
                    Embassy in the Philippines where there was also a much largeRelay Station. I
                    would make occasional business trips there and those were my first working
                    contact with an embassy. I made contact with the USIS people and learned as much
                    as I could about what they were doing. It looked like a lot more fun than what I
                    was doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the war in Vietnam beginning to affect your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: It made my life a whole lot noisier, because we lived very near the
                    west end of the Kadena Air base strip. The sound of fully loaded B 52s taking
                    off is about as loud as anything ever gets. We had to replace the putty in the
                    windows of our houses about every three months and I think the first Japanese
                    word our baby daughter learned was the word for airplane, hikoki, which the maid
                    used to comfort here when the B 52s would wake her up.</p>
                <p>Remember, we were living on a U.S. military base on a beautiful pacific island
                    until 1968. So in a sense Keiko and I were kind of isolated from all the antiwar
                    stuff that was going on in the United States. There was not a lot of American
                    questioning of our Vietnam role in Okinawa, even among American civilians and
                    the third country nationals who made up the FBIS staff.</p>
                <p>But I think Vietnam did accelerate the movement for return of Okinawa to Japan.
                    Demonstrations were beginning to clog up the streets. Some of us had a sense
                    that our time was going to be limited, but it depended a lot on who you talked
                    to. I remember one fairly senior State Department official attached to the civil
                    administration telling me that Okinawa would be returned when Japan finally made
                    a serious request for that to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in social contact with the people at the
                        consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, yes, very much so. The Consul General, Carl Brower, Dick Finch,
                    Joe Leahy, and a very close friend who was a consular officer there named Bill
                    Walker, who I eventually ended up working for as DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission)
                    when he was ambassador to El Salvador. We became close friends during that time.
                    As I mentioned before, we shared the housing area with FBIS. Their job was to
                    monitor radio broadcasting from roughly Pakistan through India to Korea and
                    China and you could throw in a few countries in between. So they had a wonderful
                    group of people from all those countries whose job was to monitor and transcribe
                    news broadcasts. They also had a club that threw great parties and served
                    excellent Chinese and western food. And we had the luxury of my wife's family
                    and her friends. So we really had, despite my failure to learn very much
                    Japanese, a very nice life. We could shift from the convenience of the base
                    economy into the fun of being in Okinawa.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were talking to the American civilian side, was the attitude “yes,
                    Okinawa is going to revert” and with the military side was it “we won it with
                    our blood and we are not going to give it up” attitude?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, that's pretty close to the basic terms of the argument. Not only
                    “we won it with our blood”, there was also a less emotional attitude, “Hey wait
                    a minute, it works well. It's good. We have a huge investment here. Don't pay
                    attention to these people that say they want to go back to Japan, because they
                    really don't. They really love us.” Remember, I talked the other session about
                    how we convinced ourselves that the Okinawans, because of a different ethnic
                    identity didn't consider themselves Japanese. Also, we would always bring up the
                    fact of Japanese discrimination against Okinawans, which was fact. It often did
                    happen. That did not mean, however, that the Okinawans didn't consider
                    themselves Japanese. They were perfectly capable of considering themselves
                    Okinawans and Japanese. But you would trot all these arguments out, and the
                    final argument would be “Japan doesn't really want Okinawa back,” and there were
                    a lot of senior people in the Japanese government who didn't much. They didn't
                    want to have to ask those questions about where nuclear weapons are being
                    stored.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't exactly a military civilian argument. While I don't remember
                    talking to any military people who favored giving Okinawa bacreversion was the
                    term we useI also don't remember very many American civilians who favored
                    reversion. There were a lot of U.S. civilians who lived in Okinawa without any
                    formal connection with the U.S. government. They ran businesses that served the
                    bases or provided professional services to military folks, or had retired from
                    the military and decided to stay on. It was a nice island a life was relatively
                    cheap. They became a lot like the “zonians” we used to talk about in Panama,
                    which meant they weren't about to give up a cushy lifestyle. They were the ones
                    who often used the super patriot arguments how we had bought Okinawa with our
                    blood.</p>
                <p>Ithink by the time I left Okinawa there was an almost total disconnect between
                    what Americans thought in Okinawa and what they were thinking in Washington, or
                    Honolulu or Tokyo. Policy makers in Washington had to balance the military value
                    of our control over Okinawa against the damage the Okinawa issue was doing to a
                    friendly government in Tokyo and to our long term relationship with Japan.
                    Military folks and DOD officials in Okinawa were concerned with the nitty gritty
                    facts of running important bases during the Vietnam war. To them it was
                    inconceivable that we would give up Okinawa merely to please the Japanese
                    government or because of highly theoretical concerns about future
                    relationships.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, but what was becoming obvious was that Okinawa was also becoming
                    an issue in Japanese domestic politics. Opposition political elements could see
                    right away that was a wonderful club to beat the government with. It involved
                    the American role in Vietnam, Japanese nationalism and what many Japanese felt
                    their country owed to people who had suffered more than any other Japanese in
                    the Second World War. This led the Japanese public to be gin asking questions
                    like, “How can we ignore what the Americans are doing in Okinawa? If we have
                    residual sovereignty then we also must have residual responsibility.” That meant
                    that every social problem associated with the military bases in Okinawa, or its
                    occupied status, took on a new resonance in mainland Japan.</p>
                <p>Criminal acts by U.S. service people, that would have been ignored in earlier
                    times, attracted new attention on the mainland.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, absolutely. My wife's family was very divided between the
                    mainland and Okinawa anyway. A lot of her direct relatives had at various times
                    moved to or studied on the mainland. Keiko's father for one studied architecture
                    in Tokyo in the twenties and returned to become an eminent architect in Okinawa.
                    During the battle for Okinawa he had been away from home in the southern Ryukyus
                    working on an architectural project for the Japanese government. After the
                    battle he returned and went to work for the U.S. civil administration building
                    housing for displaced civilians. Keiko also studied architecture on the mainland
                    before we met. Her great uncle had founded Okinawa's first newspaper, the Ryukyu
                    Shimpo. The Government of the Ryukyu Islands issued a postage stamp with his
                    portrait on it. One of her close cousins, and a friend of mine, was a writer who
                    did both journalism and books. I think they clearly believed that Okinawa would
                    and should return to Japan. There weren't very many people by the 1960s who were
                    saying, “We should stick with the Americans.” Remember, the we had promised
                    nothing for the future. If in 1945 or shortly thereafter, we had told them they
                    would be just like Hawaii, that mighand I emphasize mighhave been an attractive
                    model, but we never offered that. In the meantime, Japan kept looking like a
                    more attractive alternative. Then there were always the irritants to any
                    civilian populations living very close to a military base.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, there is a pretty unattractive honky tonk base economy around
                    the Kadena area and around Naha. In the meantime, too, there were more and more
                    young Okinawans coming back who had studied in Japan or the United States.
                    Neither one returned satisfied with the status quo. It was just not seen by the
                    Okinawans as a viable long range alternative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '68, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, in '68 I went back to the United States. In the meantime, I had
                    been agitating to change my status in the agency. I decided that I did not want
                    to continue as an administrative officer in relay stations. The first thing they
                    offered me was to go to the Philippines where they were going to build a new
                    station, saying “ you are pretty good at what you do, and that is a great
                    assignment for a young man to be an executive officer on a construction site.”
                    It probably was, if that had been what I wanted to do. I had been writing
                    letters and talking to people that came by telling them I wanted to get out of
                    relay stations and I wanted to get out of administration. I wanted to go into
                    the foreign service and do substantive work in the agency. This was what I had
                    wanted to do in the first place, and had been prevented from doing so by my
                    wife's nationality. Nothing much happened, but they said I could go back to
                    Washington. They said. “We will assign you to administrative duties and that
                    would be a better base for you to try to make the change.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife an American citizen yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, she had taken advantage of the waiver of residency requirements
                    for people who were overseas on official assignments, and gone to Honolulu and
                    become a U.S. citizen. Again, that was not an optional issue at that time. Your
                    wife had to become a U.S. citizen or you would not get further overseas
                    assignments. Did I mention last time that our daughter was born and duly
                    registered at the U.S. Consulate? Born in the Army hospital right near our
                    house. That was wonderful for Keiko to have her first child right there when
                    family was still available.</p>
                <p>A little bit more about the organization of the Relay Station, by the way. They
                    had three sites. One was the administrative headquarters at Kadena Air Base. My
                    office was very near my house. We had a receiver site at Onna Point farther
                    north on the island. And a transmitter sitthe million watt transmitter was at
                    Okuma. The U.S. Army also ran an R and R (rest and relaxation) resort for
                    officers right next door to the relay transmitter. Even more conveniently, we
                    had housing left over from the construction days. They had been maintained and
                    we were able to use them as guest houses. I spent a lot of time, partly on
                    official duties, driving up and down the island into the part of Okinawa that
                    didn't have a military presence. We spent some wonderful weekends in the sand
                    and surf of the Okuma resort. I was also able to travel a lot. As I said before
                    our administrative support came out of the Philippines. When I was in the Navy,
                    I had been able to spend a lot of time on mainland Japan and hitch rides to
                    Taiwan and Hong Kong. I especially remember one trip to Hong Kong when I flew in
                    what was called a P2V, an old antisubmarine patrol bomber. It was one of the
                    last airplanes that had the transparent nose bubble, World War II style. I sat
                    up there and flew over Hong Kong harbor. And once my parents had come to the
                    mainland and the two of us had a great time with them showing off their year old
                    granddaughter in Tokyo, Kyoto and the other tourist spots.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Keiko and I got packed up and gave away our dog and moved back to
                    Washington. Bill Walker and his wife had gone back about a year earlier, and
                    they got us an apartment in the same building they lived in near Dupont Circle.
                    A two bedroom apartment in that neighborhood was still cheap in those days. We
                    had a used car, and I went to work in the personnel division of the Voice of
                    America. Now if there was ever a job I hatethat was it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a very clear distinction between the Voice of
                        America and USIA (United States Information Agency)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, there was. That has a lot to do with some internal politics that
                    finally played themselves out now, with the total independence of the Voice. VOA
                    was always very uncomfortable belonging to an agency that had as its mission
                    propaganda, if you wanted to use the negative term, or advocacy of U.S. policy
                    position and U.S. values, and telling America's story to the world. The Voice
                    didn't like that. They considered themselves to be journalists who happened to
                    be paid by the government but were operating under a charter that absolutely
                    bound them to tell the truth like any other journalists. Now that attitude,
                    stated in its boldest terms, would drive people nuts at USIA. They would there
                    had to be some reason the American taxpayers to pay for radio broadcasting. Then
                    it would drive people even more nuts at the State Department. They would say
                    something like, “It's the Voice of America and I'm speaking for American foreign
                    policy. I want to call those persons up and tell them what to say about this
                    particular issue.” You were apt to get treated very badly by the Voice if you
                    tried to do that. But one of the things the Voice did was to always look for its
                    own facilities and it got its own personnel division, which is where I
                    worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '68 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was not there very long. Less than a year in that particular
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that made it so unattractive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, to put it in a neat superficial package, I always thought the
                    agency recruited badly. They always got people that liked to deal with people
                    and they put them in the personnel division. They took people that liked to deal
                    with figures and statistics and put them in the budget shop. The irony was that
                    all the personnel officers spent all their time filling out forms and dealing
                    with figures and statistics and very rarely met a human being, while the poor
                    bastards in budget, who didn't like to do it, spent all their time negotiating
                    with people trying to hammer out a budget. It's a theme I've often thought about
                    in considering how we train. There are other instances in the foreign service of
                    what you might almost call “perverse training.” You train a person the wrong
                    way, and the only reason it doesn't become a disaster is there are certain smart
                    ass mavericks that rise above the training and go out and get things done. We
                    try young political officers to write reporting cables and then, if they're good
                    at it, we promote them into jobs where they have to deal with people, influence
                    them, and negotiate with foreign government representativejobs for which they
                    have really not been trained. ThanGod for the mavericks.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I continued my campaigning to try to get into some other line of work, and it was
                    hard. In the first place, if the personnel people think you are any good they
                    don't want to let you go. And they control the game. But finally I got a person
                    that said, “Jeff, the only way you can do this is go out and get yourself a
                    masters degree in foreign affairs.” I said, “I already have a masters degree in
                    foreign affairs.” The person was visibly embarrassed that he hadn't read my
                    folder before he came to talk to me and said okay, they would work something
                    out. And they did.</p>
                <p>They put me in a program they devised, which had to do with training mid level
                    officers after they had done a couple of junior officer tours. It was like a lot
                    of training programs in those dayit was more on paper than a reality, and it had
                    to do with rotating people around to all different elements of the agency.
                    Probably a waste of time for mid level officers, but pretty good training for
                    me. During that six months, I wrote news on the night shift at Voice of America
                    and wrote a pamphlet for the English teaching division of USIA, went out as a
                    film crew producer to cover simple VIP (very important person) events in the
                    Washington, DC area, including Nixon going to a diplomatic soiree of some sort
                    in an embassy (I can't remember which). I remember that he stumbled over his
                    wife in front of the camera, but we cut it out.</p>
                <p>Then they called me up and said it was time to think about an assignment, and
                    they would like me to think about going to Cochabamba. Despite the fact that I
                    didn't know where Cochabamba was or even what continent it was on, I said I was
                    certainly willing to consider it.</p>
                <p>They told me to go see a lady in the foreign service personnel division and she
                    would explain it to me. She wasn't there when I got there, so I sat down and
                    realized there was only one map on the wall and it was Latin America. That
                    cleared up at least one mystery. I was to be the director of a cultural center
                    (what we called bi national centers in those days). It was a decent entry level
                    job and I said I would do it, so they sent me off to FSI (Foreign Service
                    Institutnow part of the National Foreign Affairs Training CenteNFATC) for five
                    or six months of language training. In the meantime, there had been a change. I
                    guess some State Department officer had been detailed to the agency, and they
                    had given him Cochabamba for some reason and they wanted me to go to Santa
                    Cruz.</p>
                <p>Q: Cochabamba is in Bolivia, isn't it?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They are both in Bolivia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Santa Cruz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Santa Cruz de la Sierra is the Easternmost major city of Bolivia. It
                    is in the Bolivian lowlands over toward the Amazon territory.</p>

                <p>During the tour in Washington, I learned a lot about USIA and the foreign
                    service. Also learned a lot about the United States. It was a turbulent time. I
                    suppose I felt that our military involvement had been a mistake, but I also
                    believed that a total U.S. defeat would be bad for us and for the world. I
                    remember being tear gassed in a restaurant in Dupont Circle. One of my brothers
                    was a theology student at Boston University and had come down to Washington with
                    his wife to participate in one of the moratorium marches. A bunch of marchers
                    had formed up at Dupont Circle with the intention of doing something silly like
                    serving an “eviction notice” at the Vietnamese embassy. The police decided to
                    stop them. My brother and I and our wives were having dinner at a Chinese
                    restaurant on P Street. That is where we got tear gassed. The gas actually came
                    into the restaurant. I remember the crowd on the street was still quite orderly
                    and young women were passing out damp cloths to people. At another time tear gas
                    came into our apartment. I had imagined that an occasional whiff of tear gas was
                    part of the foreign service, but I had never expected my first taste to be in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Keiko and I finished our Spanish courses at FSI and headed off for Bolivia with
                    our four and half year old daughter.</p>
                <p>Everything they say about the altitude - roughly 12,000 feet -and how lousy you
                    feel for the first couple of days is absolutely true. It was a big USIS post in
                    those days. About 20 years ago my wife ran across a group photograph, taken just
                    after we had arrived, of the USIS American staff, and there had to be 20 people.
                    Twenty USIS officers in La Paz! Cochabamba had its own USIS post. It had a two
                    officer post, plus two Americans assigned to the cultural center. We were to go
                    down to Santa Cruz, which at that time was smaller than Cochabamba, and seemed
                    much less important in Bolivia. There was only one other official American in
                    the town, and he was a military advisor assigned to the Bolivian Air Force's
                    aviation school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bolivia from '70 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was in Bolivia from '70 to '72. I actually did get there early in
                    the year of 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Bolivia at the time
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The country was under a military dictatorship of a conservative stripe
                    headed by a general named Ovando. It was barely stable at that time. We used to
                    say Bolivia had had more governments than years of national existence. A very
                    unstable country, the poorest country in the hemisphere, with the exception of
                    Haiti. Bolivians spend time thinking about the fact that they are landlocked. In
                    the war of the Pacific they lost their access to the sea to the Chileans. They
                    have never reconciled themselves to it, nor forgiven Chile for it, and no matter
                    what goes wrong in Bolivia, they tend to think, “Well, if we just had access to
                    the sea things would be better.”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The country also has some peculiar geographic views and where it is. In the
                    Eastern provinces of Bolivia, when they talk about La Paz, they refer to it as
                    the interior of the country. Now La Paz It is not all that far from the ocean in
                    anybody else's geographic view. It is the capital and it is the closest to the
                    coast. It is the Santa Cruz region that is the interior of the country. But
                    nevertheless the people in Santa Cruz and the Beni province look toward the
                    Atlantic because that is the way that part of Bolivia developed. Jesuit
                    missionaries came up the Paraguay River and other rivers into Bolivia. La Paz
                    and the highland region were settled as part of the early Spanish silver trade
                    which flowed into the Pacific through the port of Lima. It also has to do with
                    the travel conditions that prevailed until well into the twentieth century.
                    Until some roads were built and air service initiated, it was easier, or at
                    least more comfortable, for people of means living in Santa Cruz, or Riberalta
                    or Trinidathe Eastern Bolivian citieto go to London, Paris or Madrid than it was
                    to go to La Paz. You could float down the Amazon and get a steamer across the
                    Atlantic, whereas going to La Paz required three punishing weeks on mule
                    back.</p>
                <p>The two basic regions of the country also had very different indigenous bases and
                    that is very important in Latin America. In most of Latin America, the Indians
                    could never get rid of the conquistadores, but the conquistadores could never
                    get rid of the Indians. The indigenous peoples of the Andean highlands are the
                    descendants of the Aymara and their Incan conquerors, and they speak Aymara or
                    Quechua. (Some experts have estimated that only about thirty percent of
                    Bolivians are real native speakers of Spanish.) The lowland Indians are very
                    different. They relate to the Guarani speakers of Paraguay and follow tropical
                    forest, river based life style. In the lowlands there is not much contact
                    between people who live a basically European lifestyle and those who follow
                    indigenous lifestyles. I think historically lowland Indians always had a choice
                    of almost total assimilation into Spanish culturand many dior total retreat into
                    the vastness of the Amazon and Parana river basins. Many groups are still there,
                    living relatively undisturbed traditional lives in the middle of the continent,
                    but always aware that their retreat never really ends.</p>
                <p>So there is an historic and social background to the highland lowland regional
                    rivalry that is so important in Bolivian politics. It works itself out in very
                    classic ways. You almost see classic patterns of prejudice. People in the
                    highlands tend to see the people in the lowland as sort of lazy, not very
                    sanitary, over sexed, and they breed too much. They are also emotional and
                    unstable. Whereas the people in the lowland tend to see the folks up in La Paz
                    and Cochabamba, and especially those with Indian blood (which is a lot of
                    folks), as being clannish, dishonest in their business dealings, and mean. You
                    can see those patterns of prejudice play themselves out in lots of parts of the
                    world. In a way, it is almost the same sad pattern we see in this country -
                    classic anti black prejudice on one hand and anti Semitism on the other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any repercussions from Che Guevara and his
                        little escapade? That had happened a little before your time I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A little before. You have a good grasp for dates. Yes, it had happened
                    by the time I got there, but there were still a lot of stories about it. There
                    was a very strong and, at times, a rather nasty streak of anti communism in what
                    was called the Phalangist party of Bolivia. Those are persons that don't pay
                    much attention to history, or don't know any, when they pick a name like that
                    for their party. They were really proud of their roots in the Spanish Falange.
                    The Falangistas really did have a lot of support among the peasantry of Santa
                    Cruz province, and I think a lot of that came from their sense of having been
                    invaded. They didn't know whether they liked Che Guevara or not, but they knew
                    they didn't like the idea of Che Guevara as an invading foreigner. In the first
                    place they don't like “carpetbaggers”, especially Argentine carpetbaggers. They
                    would see Che Guevara more as an Argentine than a Cuban. His accent was not
                    right for a Cuban and they know an Argentine accent when they hear it, and they
                    especially don't like it when it is telling them what to do. Also, Bolivia is a
                    country that believes it had a revolution - the MNR revolution under Rene
                    Barrientos.. It was a revolution that did change things. A lot of people say,
                    “Well, it's not working like it should but it was a good revolution, it was a
                    good idea, and maybe it will.” To a foreigner who came in and said, “That wasn't
                    a real revolution, you have to have a real revolution,” they said, “What do you
                    mean? Our revolution is just as good as your revolution. Get out of here.”
                    Probably the upshot of Che was to turn the Santa Cruz region to the right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later, that whole area became a real problem with
                        narcotics. How was it at the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Nothing yet. It was a region beginning to taste prosperity in the
                    sense they had figured out that all you had to do was grow the right crop and
                    you could make money. You could see them beginning to get good at shifting
                    crops. Shifting from cotton to soy beans, for instance. There was evidence they
                    had made some crop shifts already. The land was mostly in the hands of middle
                    class landowners who were smart enough to know you had to pay attention, for
                    instance in making a shift from cotton to sugar cane or vice versa. That does
                    help explain what eventually happened. They figured out what the most profitable
                    crop was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the writ of the government of La Paz, was that
                        very strong there? We are talking about the '70 '72 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: In the first place, people in Santa Cruz almost always resent the
                    government of La Paz. There is a history of bad behavior on both sides. At that
                    time, Santa Cruz was not quite big enough to get much power in Bolivia, but they
                    were too big to suppress entirely, so there was a sense in La Paz that Santa
                    Cruz is separatist, troublesome, and needed to be kept in line. There was also a
                    sense that it might be the economic future of the country, therefore had to be
                    kept under control. This never extended to wanting to give Santa Cruz much
                    political power. A governor has been imposed who was not from Santa Cruz. A big
                    mistake. I'll get back to that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Ernie Siracusa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the writ of the embassy run in Santa Cruz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: This was after BALPA won. (BALPA was an acronym for a U.S. government
                    to reduce the balance of payments deficit y cutting U.S. government expenditures
                    abroad.) As early as 1967 it began to impact budgets. We were reducing our
                    commitments Bolivia. There had been an AID mission in Santa Cruz and it had
                    closed. There had been a Peace Corps office and it had been drawn back to La
                    Paz. By the time it got there, there was a rump USIS post, but without an
                    American officer in charge, only a national employee who handed out films and
                    things. I was given supervision over him without being named BPAO (Branch Public
                    Affairs Officer - a traditional USIS title) for Santa Cruz, because that had
                    financial implications. I was named only as the Director of the Centro Boliviano
                    Americano, a USIS accredited binational center.</p>
                <p>All of us who worked for the government at times have had to listen to some
                    private sector windbag tell us how we don't know anything about the real world
                    because we have never had to meet a payroll. If you are the Director of a U.S.
                    sponsored binational center, you had to damn well learn how to meet a payroll.
                    Although we got ad hoc, occasional subsidies from USIS La Paz, basically we had
                    to take in enough money from English teaching to support the building and to
                    support the Center, including a program of cultural activities if we could find
                    any. I went in and found a building that was in pretty bad shape. The
                    administrator of the Center was a lady well into her '70s. It was a tough
                    assignment to try to keep the place financially solvent. The building looked so
                    awful, I decided we had to make it look better. The cheapest way to do that was
                    to whitewash it because that was the cheapest stuff you could get. I did scrape
                    together the money to have people come in and whitewash the place and then was
                    absolutely delighted when a comment in one of the newspapers congratulated the
                    American Cultural Center on its restoration of an historic building. All I had
                    done was have it whitewashed.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>And we found out, to our delight, that we had Okinawa connections in Santa Cruz.
                    On my first day in the office, almost the first person to come to call on me was
                    a very successful immigrant from Okinawa to Bolivia who had been a colleague of
                    my father in law in the early days of the U.S. administration.</p>
                <p>I was talking about the Japanese immigration. There were two programone on the
                    mainland of Japan funded by the Japanese government and one in Okinawa funded by
                    USAID. Both programs were based on the willingness of the Bolivian government to
                    give generous amounts of land to people who would go down to Eastern Bolivia and
                    farm it. The Bolivian government, of course, had the land because of the U.S.
                    supported land reform carried out by the MNR government of Rene Barrientos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in connection with the same program that was
                        going in Brazil too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, in a sense guess it was, although I don't think there was any
                    USAID involvement in Brazil or any program specifically for Okinawa. Also the
                    programs in Brazil and Peru, and perhaps elsewhere, predated World War II.</p>
                <p>Basically, the USAID Okinawan model would provide a basic village infrastructure.
                    There would be a community hall and some basic machinery, with a place to store
                    and repair it, and some other things. I don't remember now how much land the
                    Bolivian government was willing to give, but it was a lot by Japanese or
                    Okinawan standards. I remember being in the port of Naha once and seeing a ship
                    leaving, with a band playing, paper streamers going from ship to shore and
                    people calling their farewells. Someone explained these were people leaving
                    Okinawa as immigrants to Bolivia.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, a Mr. Ishu came to call on me on my first day at the
                    cultural center and we had discovered that he had known my wife's father. He had
                    held a similar position to me father in laws in the U.S. administration, right
                    after the end of the war, when my wife's father had worked on programs to
                    provide emergency housing. Mr. Ishu had been involved in food distribution at
                    that time. He had a fascinating history. He had first immigrated to Peru before
                    the second world war. When the war broke out he returned to Japan. I don't know
                    quite what he did, but toward the end of the war he managed to be captured by
                    the British, maybe in Malaya, and somehow was turned over to the Americans. He
                    finally found himself working in Okinawa, and once again decided to immigrate to
                    South America. This time went to Bolivia. Keiko and I visited them a few times.
                    The Ishu family was unusual in that they had left the agricultural business and
                    moved to Santa Cruz. He had done well distributing films to the Okinawan and
                    mainland Japanese colonies. He would import Japanese language films and get a
                    projector, take them out to villages, and show movies.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The colonies weren't really very prosperous in the eyes of the people who had to
                    live in them. But by Bolivian standards they looked miraculous and there is
                    little doubt that the Japanese Okinawan colonies radically changed the diet of
                    Eastern Bolivia (maybe all of Bolivia) by providing a lot of fruits and
                    vegetables they had not had before. But for the colonists, in terms of making
                    your fortune and a very good life, they didn't work very well. I suppose the
                    Bolivian market was too small and too poor and transportation links to
                    population centers in Brazil, Argentina or Paraguay too primitive to make
                    anybody's fortune in truck farming. Keiko and I visited one of the colonies. It
                    was basically a pretty tough lifhard farm work and very few conveniences. You
                    had to wonder whether the immigrants had made the right decision about their
                    lives when you thought of how they might be living in prosperous Japan and
                    Okinawa. I also think the colonists lived with a constant wary tension about
                    Bolivian politics. There is an old Japanese saying that the nail that sticks its
                    head up gets pounded down. The Bolivian government also had programs to get
                    Indians from the altiplanthe highland plain of the Andes - to move down to the
                    subtropical lowlands. It was not an easy move for the highlanders. Some suffered
                    from a kind of reverse altitude sickness and all had to learn new ways to farm.
                    Bolivia had had a land reform and a tradition of campesinos occupying
                    agricultural lands. I think the colonists may have felt that if they did too
                    well, they might lose it all. As far as I could see there was virtually no
                    Japanese or Okinawan presence in the political life of Bolivia.</p>
                <p>Consequently, the colonies in Bolivia lost people to Brazil. The big magnet was
                    of course, Sao Paulo, wherKeiko and I were to later to serve. By the 1970s there
                    were perhaps a million ethnic Okinawan and mainland Japanese living in Sao Paulo
                    state with by far the largest concentration in the city of Sao Paulo. And they
                    were very successful in Brazil. They had done well in businesses of all kinds
                    and were active in politics. In the mid seventies, the minister of mines and
                    energy, Shigeaki Ueki, was an ethnic Japanese. At the same time a majority of
                    the students at the University of Sao Paulo's prestigious medical school were
                    Japanese Brazilians. And those young people, now at least into a third
                    generation, were very Brazilian. A Japanese American colleague of mine at the
                    Consulate General, used to joke that it took two generations in the U.S. to ruin
                    a good Japanese while in Brazil it only took one.</p>
                <p>Japanese were of course not the only non Hispanic immigrants to Bolivia. There
                    were Germanboth prand post World War II, both Jewish and non Jewisas well as
                    Levantine Arabs, overseas Chinese, and smattering of Serbs and Irish. These
                    groups can be found throughout most of Latin America. The Arabs and Jews were
                    particularly well established in retail commerce, a field traditionally
                    undervalued by Hispanic cultures. In popular parlance the Arabs are still called
                    Turcos since early immigrants from the had carried Turkish passports.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Perhaps the most curious of the immigrants to eastern Bolivia were the Canadian
                    Mennonites. I first noticed them selling butter from horse drawn wagons in the
                    streets of Santa Crumen in the bib overhauls of prairie farmers and women
                    wearing long dresses and poke bonnets, accompanied by similarly dressed
                    children. They were twentieth century immigrants from Canada who left to avoid
                    such governmental outrages as compulsory education for their children. Keiko and
                    I also visited one of their farmIn a land of Spanish colonial adobe and
                    Floridian concrete block it was an amazing sigha one story farmhouse with a
                    long, low front porch that looked like something of a western movie about sod
                    busters. Although the residents were courteous enough, communication in Spanish
                    was difficult.</p>
                <p>Meeting the daily plane from La Paz at the Santa Cruz airport was an experience
                    in diversity, although I don't think we used that word yet. On a good day you
                    would see groups of highland Indians in their bowler hats and ponchos, Santa
                    Cruz natives in guayaberas and sport shirts, Japanese with a young girl in a
                    kimono carrying a bouquet of flowers, overhauled, poke bonneted Mennonites and
                    maybe even a couple of young Mormon missionaries in their white shirts and black
                    trousers. And top it off, the second best restaurant in town was Chinese.</p>
                <p>I was the only civilian American official in Santa Cruz. There was also a U.S.
                    Air Force major who was an adviser to the Bolivian Air Force flight training
                    school at the Santa Cruz airport. This meant that when I made trips to La Paz,
                    people in other parts of the embassy were more interested in talking to me than
                    they would have been had there been a bigger U.S. government presence in the
                    region. I would get a lot of phone calls and little jobs to do every now and
                    then. Not exactly political reporting, but talking on the phone with somebody
                    who was doing political reporting.</p>
                <p>Life became fairly pleasanthe Center was fun to run, we had a nice house, Keiko
                    had done a remarkable job in learning the local markets and hired a competent
                    maid, and our daughter was in a nursery school sponsored by the local Club de
                    Leonethat's the Lions Cluthe same one we have here in the States. We ran into
                    one linguistic snafu with my daughter's name. We had given her the lovely
                    traditional Japanese name, Mariko. We noticed some puzzled, if not horrified,
                    looks when we introduced her. Somebody quickly explained that the name sounded
                    very much like maricon, the popular Spanish slang term for a male homosexual. We
                    quickly dropped the “ko” and settled for Mari, with the emphasis on the first
                    syllable. It was not a difficult adjustment since many modern Japanese women
                    have made the same deletion from their names. How I had missed the word maricon
                    at FSI, I'll never know. Maybe it never came up. As someone once said, “At the
                    Foreign Service Institute they teach you how to discuss the balance of payments
                    but not how to ask for the rest room.”</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>As was customary, the Center had a local board of directors. They were well
                    established residents of Santa Cruz. The president, as I remember, was Fausto
                    Medrano who was active in the Phalangist Party (Falange Socialista BolivianFSB.)
                    Although the board didn't pay much attention to the Center and let me run it as
                    I wanted, they were good friends, contacts and at times advisers. English
                    teaching was the mainstay of the Center and the biggest source of funds. It was
                    the only serious English teaching in town, but it was still awful. I was able to
                    hire some native American speakers of English who knew the system that was being
                    used at that time. By getting to know some of the Americans and hiring some
                    American wives of Bolivians to teach for me, we made a bit of progress.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived I was visited by a group of young people asking me if I
                    would direct the Santa Cruz municipal chorus, known as the Coro Santa Cecilia.
                    Dumbfounded I asked them what made them think I could direct a chorus. They
                    said, “Well, our last director was an American Peace Corps volunteer and he knew
                    how, so we thought you might know, too,” Funny thing was I had briefly directed
                    a chapel choir while in the navy and after years of church choirs, high school
                    and college choruses I knew enough of the repertoire that I figured I could fake
                    it. The only trouble was they, understandably enough, also wanted to do Bolivian
                    music, of which I knew nothing and lacked the training and talent to learn.
                    Fortunately, the accompanist, the daughter of our friend Mr. Ishu, agreed to
                    direct the Bolivian music iI would do the classical stuff. So that's how a
                    became a choir director. We had maybe thirty singers and it was fun. We did
                    wedding gigs and prepared a full, formal concert that went just fine and got
                    good reviews in the local papers.</p>
                <p>I guess I got there in January. Sometime in November, or maybe December, I'm not
                    sure, one of my friends on the board who was an avid hunter, “Jeff, we want to
                    take this great trip. We want to get on the Amazon headwaters and float all the
                    way down to Trinidad in Beni Provence. We are going to hunt and fish all the way
                    down.” At any rate this was going to be a major two week expedition, and I
                    thought that sounded like just about as much fun as I was ever going to have any
                    place. I went out and bought some basic equipment, including a shotgun, although
                    I had never hunted in my life, as well as a bit of fishing gear and a good pair
                    of boots. I asked USIS La Paz for and got two weeks leave. We took off in a
                    couple of pickup trucks one day and got up to the Yapacani River where I saw one
                    of the most astounding sights of my life. Near the river is a bridge, funded
                    partly by AID, which is a bridge over nothing. After they started to build the
                    bridge and got it almost completed, there was a big series of storms and the
                    river changed course. This happens more than people realize in South America. It
                    built up a big head of water coming down, and broke through some barriers, and
                    decided to be elsewhere. The bridge was there but somebody moved the river out
                    from under it.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Anyway we crossed the Yapacani and on the other side we picked up a guide in a
                    big flat bottom wooden boat with an old Volvo Penta outboard motor and two 50
                    gallon drums of extra fuel. We took off on this marvelous trip. We were on the
                    river in the mornings, then got out of the heat, rigged our hammocks and rested
                    through the lunch hour, and then doing some hunting in the late afternoon before
                    making camp. We were a bunch of Bolivians, me and one German. He was a school
                    teacher at the German school. We ate all sorts of stuff that I never want to eat
                    again in my life. We managed to bag a tapir which is a pretty big animal and
                    good to eat. All you could take with you was dry stores, and we drank river
                    water. Put tablets in it. My Spanish got a whole lot better.</p>
                <p>About a week into the trip, I had a short wave radio with me, and we rigged up an
                    antenna on our lunch time break and got the news from Santa Cruz. The lead item
                    was - my Center had been bombed. The tail end of the broadcast, and I'm not
                    making this up, was a little item saying a group of hunters that had been
                    rumored as kidnaped had been spotted at the confluence of the Yapacani and
                    Marmore Rivers. They had been seen by the Bolivian Navy, and were all right, and
                    on their way to Trinidad. We were laughing saying, “Boy, what a pack of idiots,
                    who are those persons?” Then all of a sudden we realized that we had checked in
                    at a Bolivian Navy post and that we were the idiots. There had been disturbances
                    on the other side of the Yapacani River when we left. Some peasants had gotten
                    out of control. There was some politics involved in it, and somehow out of that,
                    and us being in the area, the rumor had gotten started and believed by lots of
                    people, that we had been kidnaped. This had gone on almost a week with none of
                    us knowing this story was around. The embassy was very worried about it, not to
                    mention my wife. The Air Force person in Santa Cruz had borrowed an airplane and
                    flew out to try to find us. The trouble was he tended to fly during the middle
                    of day when we were ashore under cover.</p>
                <p>We decided we had better make tracks and get to Trinidad, which was the nearest
                    city with any communications. However, it took us a couple more days to get
                    there. Once there, I was able to call in. Of course the pressure was off by then
                    because we had been spotted. I was able to call in and get a bit of a report as
                    to what happened to my Center. Then it started raining, so it was about three
                    more days before I could hitch a ride back to Santa Cruz on a private plane. The
                    air strip was dirt and not usable during the rain. Air was the only way out.
                    There was no road. People used to say that Trinidad had more planes than cars.
                    Finally I got back to Santa Cruz. The Center had been bombed and occupied, and
                    sacked by students. It had not reopened. We are now into the month oDecember of
                    '70. The Center was basically closed down and not functioning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: The attack had been run by leftist students out of the university.
                    They also had been circulating leaflets saying that any American official found
                    in Santa Cruz would be brought to justice. La Paz decided I needed to be pulled
                    out of there. We, very discreetly without saying good bye to anybody, got on the
                    plane to La Paz.</p>
                <p>On October 6, 1970 there had been a military coup d'etat. General Ovando, who had
                    been in power only slightly more than a year, was overthrown by General Juan
                    Jose Torres. Torres was a bit of an oddity, although not an unprecedented one,
                    in Latin American politican ostensibly leftist general. This made a certain
                    amount of sense in Bolivia, a country that believed that Rene Barrientos had
                    already given it its revolution. Espousing populist doctrines, Torres came to
                    power with considerable support from the Bolivian left. Although he had some
                    good people with him, he eked out his eleven months in power trying to pay off
                    political debts to far left elements who had supported his coup. Student groups
                    would occupy university buildings, or our cultural centers, or campesino
                    agricultural workers would take over farm lands and, in effect, dare the
                    government to do something about it. The tactic was to radicalize the government
                    by creating “facts on the ground.” Given his political debts and his tenuous
                    hold on power, Torres chose to do nothing. You have to wonder why we keep
                    referring to military dictators as “strong men.” Most of them are anything
                    but.</p>
                <p>There had also been another unpleasant incident shortly after the Torres coup. A
                    U.S. military jazz banprobably out of SOUTHCOM (the U.S. Southern Command) in
                    Panama had come to give a concert in the main plaza of Santa Cruz. These
                    concerts happened from time to time and were very popular. During the concert
                    somebody - I guess university students - shot off firecrackers and threw animal
                    blood on the band. The band ducked for cover and the large audience looked
                    around to see what had happened. When the perpetrators broke for cover in the
                    university building which was right on the plaza, they were chased by some very
                    angry music lovers who - I was told - caught them and treated them rather badly.
                    The band continued with the concert.</p>
                <p>So, with the leftist student groups thinking they had tacit support, or at least
                    a certain tolerance, from the Torres government, our cultural centers became
                    fair game. By mid 1971 all of cultural centers except Santa Cruz - that is La
                    Paz, Cochabamba and Sucre - would be under occupation.</p>
                <p>In the case of Santa Cruz center there had never been a real occupation. They had
                    attacked the center with a bomb and then sacked it. We were quickly back in the
                    building but essentially out of business because of security concerns, missing
                    equipment, and damage to the building. With the center in our hands, the head of
                    USIS in La Paz, Al Hansen, under pressure from Washington to reduce American
                    positions and with the Ambassador's concurrence, decided it was time to close
                    out the American presence at the Santa Cruz binational center. We would continue
                    to support it but with a Bolivian director.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>My job would be to move to Cochabamba, where they needed a new director anyway,
                    and I would have about a year to work myself out of a job and turn it over to
                    Bolivian management. I would retain some sort of titular directorship also at
                    the Santa Cruz Center, because that gave us some administrative advantages with
                    the USIA in Washington. We would send a Bolivian down from USIS La Paz to run
                    the Center. The Bolivian chosen for the job was Raul Mariaca, an extraordinarily
                    competent USIS national employee. He was an accomplished portrait artist who had
                    served at the Bolivian embassy in Washington and wanted a breather from the
                    unsettled political climate of La Paz. So Raul and I went down to Santa Cruz and
                    put the center back in business. Then Keiko, Mari and I got in our 1968 Corvair
                    and drove to Cochabamba. It was an adventurous, day long trip with the poor
                    Corvair gasping for breath and barely making it over a ten thousand foot high
                    pass nicknamed Siberia for its miserable climate.</p>
                <p>Cochabamba was a very different town. Santa Cruz had been a frontier town (almost
                    a cowboy style place) with a strong sense of all that empty land to the east and
                    its links to the early Spanish colonization of Paraguay. Cochabamba is a classic
                    Andean colonial city, on the model of Cuzco in Peru. A beautiful place with
                    beautiful buildings, in a heavenly climate. It sits at about 8,000 feet which
                    means that, unlike Pa Paz, there is enough air to breathe, and the climate is
                    wonderful. Its cultural and political traditions look to the Andean altiplano
                    and the Incan and Spanish empires. The Center was fairly prosperous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for the people studying English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Learning English. Look, this became important in Cochabamba. The real
                    support for those Centers, I guess, was sort of middle lower middle class
                    families who really thought part of their kids education ought to be to learn
                    English. It was a very important thing. They could travel; and they could study
                    in the States they were smart. All sorts of things. It was a very respectable,
                    middle class thing to do to have your kids study at the American cultural
                    center. The cultural center did offer other things. We had a library; we had a
                    small auditorium; we showed films all the time; and when we could put something
                    together we would have cultural events. A concert, an art show with local
                    artists, and concerts with local people. Every now and then some sort of
                    traveling attraction - an American pianist, or a U.S. military band - would come
                    through, sponsored by USIS La Paz and they would send them down to Cochabamba to
                    entertain in our center or to Santa Cruz. Those Centers really worked. They were
                    seen as bi national and had a lot of local support. People liked them. That was
                    soon to be proven to me in very graphic terms in Cochabamba.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I'm not exactly sure when this happened but probably in June or July. I had come
                    back from lunch and gone into my office in the center when I heard a commotion
                    out in the patio. A bunch of students from the university had come storming in
                    and occupied the center. The students that occupied the center had been pushed
                    out and told me they were going to keep the center because they couldn't let
                    “this nest of spies and imperialist penetration continue to exist” in their
                    city. They advised me to leave, and after thinking it over very briefly I did.
                    In the meantime the center administrator, Raul Peredo, known affectionately as
                    the colonel because he was a veteran of the Chaco War against Paraguay in the
                    1930s had contacted local authorities. They said, “We recognize there is a
                    problem and the students have to leave, but the Americans can't come back, and
                    we will take care of this Center until this problem is resolved.”</p>
                <p>I can't remember what I did first - probably called the embassy to tell them I
                    had just lost another center . Probably the next day, I went to see the prefect,
                    who was the presidentially appointed governor of the province. He was an army
                    colonel, or maybe even a general, named Jaime Mendieta. It was an extraordinary
                    interview because he basically said, “You persons have the support of the people
                    in this town and everybody loves your Center. Why don't you put on a
                    demonstration? Why don't you march in the streets?” Weird. Here was the senior
                    representative of the government in the region suggesting to an American that he
                    organize a demonstration. So I did. Given the fact that I was working with the
                    center's excellent board of directors it wasn't hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: First I met with the board. They were all for some kind of action. We
                    put out the word that everybody was going to meet at a certain time. I of course
                    did not participate in the march. We just put out the word among the students
                    and their parents, and the soccer team we sponsored, and the other institutions
                    we gave things to. We called in all our contacts. Individual board members
                    helped a lot. There was a big rumor in town that this was the precursor of a
                    move to outlaw private education. Personally, I think it was horse hockey. I
                    don't think there was ever such an intention on the part of the government. But
                    it made a good rumor and it certainly worked to our advantage. The march was
                    held. It was big and got a lot of sympathetic attention in the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The president of the board was Enrique Huerta, a gentleman of great good sense
                    and political savvy. In our meeting the next day, after flailing around a bit on
                    trying to organize a delegation to go see the president of the republic,
                    somebody, I don't remember who, came up with a much better idea. Even though we
                    had been deprived of our building, there was no reason why we couldn't continue
                    with the center. We would go out to the Plaza Colon, which was a big beautiful
                    park right across from the center, have our classes out there, and do everything
                    that we did in the building. We would have regularly scheduled classes, and the
                    cultural events that were scheduled. The more we thought about this, the more we
                    thought it was a very good idea. It would be our own form of student
                    protest.</p>
                <p>So the board president, the center administrator and I discussed the idea of
                    holding outdoor classes with the teachers and they were enthusiastically in
                    favor. We decided to go ahead and set a date for the first classes. All classes
                    had always been held in the late afternoon and early evening to accommodate
                    students in other schools and working people.</p>
                <p>By that time Raul Mariaca had the Santa Cruz center up and running well so he
                    came up to Cochabamba to help out. Although I had not given the embassy any
                    advance notice of the earlier street demonstration, I did discuss the Plaza
                    Colon idea with Al Hansen and, at some point with Ambassador Siracusa, since I
                    thought eventually we were going to need some financial support. I was grateful
                    for their support. I guess they both figured that while we might give up a
                    center for budgetary reasons, we sure as hell weren't going to have one taken
                    away from us. I was also getting a lot of help from John Maoist in the embassy
                    political section, who had been one of my predecessors at the center and knew
                    the territory and the players. As I remember he was in contact with one of the
                    organizers of the takeover, who, ironically enough, we had sent to the States
                    earlier on as part of a program for student leaders. I guess we sure could pick
                    them. He certainly was a leader. But come to think of it, in those days the
                    States was a great place to learn how to take over things.</p>
                <p>On the day classes were to begin Mariaca, Keiko and I a couple of other had
                    dinner at our house. Afterwards we decided to walk down to the Plaza Colon to
                    see how it was gointo see whether this was working. I had purposely not been
                    there for the beginning of classes because it was important that I not appear to
                    be the organizer of this thing. We wanted to make it look very Bolivian. I
                    remember going down there and realizing the Plaza was full, and this almost
                    brought tears to my eyes. There were these kidmaybe a couple hundred of
                    thesitting in circles on the ground spaced around the Plaza, and teachers
                    running them through their English lessons. It was quite a sight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the leftists students react to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, they began to threaten. They began to wander around muttering
                    threats. I mentioned we had a soccer team. Our soccer team had been started by
                    one of my predecessors who had worked with an American Maryknoll priest to get
                    it started. It was from about the toughest, poorest, hard scrabble neighborhood
                    of Cochabamba. We had sponsored this team for a number of years and they were a
                    very good soccer team. I used to go to their games and hope they wouldn't win,
                    but they almost always did. When they won I had to drink, what seemed to me,
                    about two gallons of fermented chicha out of the trophy cup they had won.
                    Drinking out of a trophy cup doesn't taste good to start with, and to my taste
                    neither does chicha. They became our security guards in the plaza. More than
                    once, they simply ushered the university students out of the Plaza. And as the
                    threats became known, parents began joining their kids in the Plaza. That
                    increased security, and also increased the size of the crowd. Parents were
                    bringing their kids to class and staying there to keep an eye on them during the
                    class, and then taking them home. This went on for six weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought this was really sticking it to the
                        leftist students.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, it was. But they didn't have enough support. In the meantime,
                    parents were joining their kids, and rumors of the end of private education are
                    circulating. A couple of members of my board were writing scurrilous handbills
                    and then paying the soccer team to distribute them at soccer matches. The bills
                    said things like, “Sure, the spoiled university students want to close down the
                    bi national center because that is where the people of this town have a chance
                    to get some education. They want to keep the education for themselves.” It was
                    close enough to the mark, and written in extremely insulting terms, that it
                    worked pretty well.</p>
                <p>About half way through it the Prefect again got hold of us and said, “You persons
                    have all those people in the Plaza Colon, why don't you take back your Center?
                    Saturday would be a good time to do that.” I had some reservations, but the
                    board members wanted to do this, so on Saturday the people who usually studied
                    there gathered, and went over the wall into the Center. Unfortunately, the
                    police were waiting and kicked them out and not very gently. I had spent a
                    nervous Saturday morning in my house getting reports over the phone. On Monday,
                    I went back to the Prefect and said, “You told us to do this.” He said, “Think
                    of the great publicity you got. The police have expelled the rightful owners
                    from their own house.”</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Anyway, we stayed in the Plaza for about six weeks. And remember the students
                    were paying for the right to sit on the ground during fairly chilly Andean
                    nights, although thanks to a subsidy from USIS La Paz, we were able to reduce
                    tuition and still pay the teachers. Finally we got a call from the Prefect
                    saying, “I have the keys to the center. Send a Bolivian and I will give them to
                    him, and you are back in business.” I sat on a park bench in the Plaza Colon and
                    looked at the Center while Colonel Peredo marched down to the prefect and got
                    the keys, came back and opened the Center. I was the first one to walk through
                    the door. The next morning classes began again. The Cochabamba newspaper, Los
                    Tiempos, wrote an editorial congratulating us.</p>
                <p>So we got our cultural center back. But the occupation of the centers in La Paz
                    and Sucre continued. There was an important difference. In Cochabamba, the local
                    authorities had expelled the occupiers as well as the owners saying that they
                    would maintain control until the “problem” was resolved. In La Paz, the
                    government let the leftist students hold on to the building. The real credit of
                    course goes to the board members, teachers, parents and students who were not
                    going let what they saw as a bunch of snotty little university students take
                    their English school away from them. The studentboth kids and adultas well as
                    parents, had stuck it out during chilly evenings in the plaza. The middle class
                    had won one in Cochabamba.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later, in August 1971, the Phalangists and their military allies,
                    sensing an opportunity in Torres' inability or unwillingness to control the
                    radical left, launched a coup from Santa Cruz. Within a two or three days they
                    controlled the country and installed Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez as one more so
                    called president of Bolivia. I got very involved in reporting because I was
                    sitting in Cochabamba but knew some of the territory in Santa Cruz. Being a sort
                    of radio buff, I was able to get a lot of broadcasts out oSanta Cruz that
                    couldn't be heard in La Paz. So I spent a lot of time on the phone with Tony
                    Freeman, who was the political counselor at that time. We were trying to sort
                    out who was doing what to whom during that coup.</p>
                <p>The Banzer government proved to be pretty durable. Some of my Bolivian friends
                    thought the first blow of the revolt was the return of the Cochabamba cultural
                    center. I think that was an exaggeration, although Jaime Mendieta, the friendly
                    prefect, did become Banzer's defense minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the oral history of Ernie Siracusa was talking about
                        a lot of death threats, I think he was talking about the time during the
                        Torres thing. This was students he was talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, only in a very general sense. There was a certain specialization
                    on the left. Students occupied university buildings and our centers; campesinos,
                    logically enough, carried out land takeovers and urban workers would grab an
                    occasional neighborhood. I guess I really don't know who specifically would have
                    been responsible for death threats, but they were certainly in the air. It's not
                    impossible that they could have come from the far right also. Just a word about
                    Siracusa. When the Cochabamba Center was taken I think the PAO (Public Affairs
                    Officer), who was under a lot of budget pressure, was ready to cut and take the
                    losses and withdraw to La Paz, and I wouldn't have blamed him. But Siracusa, who
                    like most ambassadors had never shown an overwhelming interest in cultural
                    centers, was very supportive and encouraging of our efforts in Cochabamba to
                    keep the center alive. He was very much in favor of our classes out in the
                    Plaza. He earned my gratitude for being so helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the students in Bolivia were having a great
                        time being leftists until they got out into the world, at which time they
                        turned into titans of industry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure. I mentioned that the person who engineered the takeover of the
                    Center in Cochabamba had been up to the states for a few months as a potential
                    leader in one of our old leader grants. We picked him pretty well in terms of
                    leadership qualitiewe just didn't know he was going to lead people against us.
                    He eventually ended up in senior positions in a couple of governments in the
                    eighties. I think he even was a minister at some point. I guess that's being a
                    titan or something or other, and there's not a whole lot of industry in
                    Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When university students start playing games with the
                        “town and gown” type thing and screwing things up, did you get the feeling
                        they were getting desperate trying to do something? It was cute but it
                        wasn't working out very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know whether desperatit wasn't working out very well but I
                    think they knew that. I think they thought this was their chance to assert some
                    power with the Torres government in charge. I mentioned before a Latin American
                    political phenomenon which I think is important. Probably the most graphic and
                    tragic example of it was in Chile. When people like Torres come to power with
                    great support from the left, they start to do the sensible pragmatic thing, and
                    begin to solidify their support in the center. This of course begins to alienate
                    them from the extremes. The tactics of the extremists then is to do something,
                    and dare the government to undo it. Then if you do something and the government
                    doesn't undo it, you can say to the people you are trying to recruit, “We have
                    the support of the government. They didn't do anything about our occupation of
                    whatever. We helped them get into power and they are now helping us.” Part of it
                    is the act itself, to get a commitment out of the government. If the government
                    lets them take the Cochabamba Center, why would they object if the students take
                    some other private schools? Or, why would the government object if students want
                    to do thus and so with the university? It's the committing act. It is what the
                    Cuban American National Foundation has done with success to the U.S. government
                    with stuff like TV Marti. The Prefect in Cochabamba was an appointee of the
                    Torres government but one of the moderates who said, “I don't want to see these
                    persons win this.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: He was trying to get me to take action. And I was trying to get
                    someone else to take action because I felt making this an issue of Americans
                    against Bolivians would be a loser. It was in our interest to present the center
                    as a Bolivian institution, as a Bolivian private educational institution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I suppose I was. There was a time when the embassy advised me in those
                    last days in Santa Cruz to hire a bodyguard. It wasn't a very satisfactory
                    operation. All I could get was an off duty policeman that I didn't much trust.
                    He was supposed to follow me wherever I went. I don't think I was under any
                    particular threat in Cochabamba. There was no bombing. There was no evidence of
                    firearms. There was no violence. It was a 1960s sort of thing. People can be on
                    the opposite side of a dispute but if they are coming out of a common shared
                    political base, they can often carry out the dispute without having to kill each
                    other. We were dancing a dance where we both knew the steps.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say our interests were in Bolivia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: In context of the cold war, geography was a lot. Okinawa was the
                    keystone of the Pacific because it was in the middle of everything. Bolivia was
                    the keystone of Latin Americit borders on more countries than anybody else. It
                    has a lot of isolated border areas. It has poverty and a social system which is
                    almost a western hemisphere kind of apartheid. There is a great gulf between
                    those people who consider themselves to be whites of European ancestry, and
                    those who consider themselves Indians and follow Indian culture and tradition.
                    We, like Che Guevara, thought it was ripe for revolution and would make a great
                    base for revolution to spread in all sorts of directions. The U.S. government
                    had been in support of Rene Barrientos and the MNR in the sixties. This was
                    their revolution. We liked him and it was a USAID revolution in many ways, and
                    we were very supportive of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned about Nazi Germans? Were they
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I suppose so. I was much more worried about Phalangist Spaniards.
                    There were a few Germans. We didn't get quite the same stories you did in
                    Argentina. When Banzer came to power, his main support was the Bolivian
                    Phalangist party, the FSB. After the coup there were some nasty anti Communists
                    moves, with tinges of anti Semitism. I remember a publishing company called Los
                    Amigos Del Libro, owned by a person named Werner Gutentag, who was a Jewish
                    emigrant from Germany. He was running Bolivia's only publishing enterprise, as
                    well as two or three book stores in the major cities. He had published some
                    books under the USIS book program. That was a USIS program where you would get a
                    publisher to publish a book and you would agree to buy so many copies to
                    distribute to libraries, etc. One day Gutentag was at home and a bunch of police
                    goons broke into his house, confiscated books, many of which had communism in
                    the title because we got him to publish them. Those sub literate boobs couldn't
                    tell the difference between a communist and an anti Communist book. They accused
                    him of being a communist and put him under house arrest. The embassy was
                    outraged. USIS knew Gutentag well and liked him. Many people in La Paz thought
                    well of him and the fact that the government was doing this seemed outrageous.
                    The Cochabamba police had gotten out of control. Like the center occupation, it
                    went on and on. As a show of support from the embassy, Keiko and I would sort of
                    ostentatiously drive to his house in a very recognizable U.S. official vehicle
                    and call on him. I guess the guards were bright enough to figure out that meant
                    the Americans liked Gutentag. It was sad to see this person confined to his
                    house. It was a precursor of the situation we would have later on with Jacobo
                    Timerman in Argentina. Eventually Gutentag was released and his work was given
                    back to him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Allende's election have an influence in Bolivia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Allende was elected in September of 1970 and Torres staged his coup in
                    October. Sure, I think that probably did have a kind of generalized ideological
                    influence, but remember that Bolivians don't want to admit any kind of
                    influences from Chile. They were the folks that took away Bolivia's access to
                    the sea in the War of the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if there was a concern that Latin America
                        was going to go left and anti American? Was that sort of in the air?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That was always there. Latin America was an ideological battle ground.
                    The Soviets working out of their base in Havana were trying to undermine all of
                    the somewhat vulnerable Latin American dictatorships. Depending on where you
                    stood in your own personal politics, you either thought that the military
                    dictatorships were a defense against communism or that they were creating the
                    very conditions that would bring communism. That is another reason why the MNR
                    revolution in Bolivia was important. The United States was trying to come down
                    squarely at an intelligent middle. It didn't always work well. We gave a lot of
                    support to land reform during the Barrientos period. First, AID spent a lot of
                    money on land reform, then they spent a lot of money on forming cooperatives,
                    because the land reform was too inefficient. Lots of folks had their little plot
                    of land, too small to make a living from.</p>
                <p>That about wraps up Bolivia. I left Cochabamba feeling real good. I had my Center
                    back, and was given some nice farewell parties. And I was very happy with my
                    next assignment in Argentina. General Banzer stayed around for quite a while. In
                    1977, after having retired from the military, he was elected president in
                    reasonable free elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so we'll pick this up next time and you will be off
                        in 1972 to Buenos Aires.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Right.</p>

                        off to Buenos Aires, Argentina. You were there from '72 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: To '74.</p>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure. We took a nice long leave and arrived in Buenos Aires in January
                    of 1972. We had actually taken a vacation earlier from Bolivia and passed
                    through Buenos Aires, and discovered then that it was a town we liked very much,
                    so we were delighted to be back there. As it turned out, it was getting towards
                    the last days of the military governments. The economy was not actually in a
                    shambles, but had just gone through a severe devaluation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which government was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: This was the last days of the Lanusse government. The Argentine peso
                    had just been devalued. I remember reporting for duty at USIS in the embassy
                    building, and being taken out to lunch and discovering I had a wonderful steak
                    and a salad with all the trimmings for $1.25. It made me think I was going to
                    enjoy this tour very much. I went in there assigned as the Labor Information
                    Officer, in the Information Section. But things were changing very quickly, and
                    the PAO and some of the others figured out they didn't really need a labor
                    information officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had been the origin of having a labor information
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know. The person I replaced had spent a lot of time in the
                    labor movement. The idea was to maintain liaison with the labor movement, and to
                    help foster ties with American labor groups. But that didn't seem to fit with
                    the direction in which USIS was going, and I was assigned different duties,
                    which were basically called the Press and Information Officer. This meant I was
                    in charge of getting things published in the Argentine press. The USIS post was
                    big by today's standards. The information section alone had four officers,
                    including press attach?, who worked directly with the ambassador and was rather
                    independent from the rest of the USIS operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The ambassador was Lodge, John Davis Lodge. A colorful character. He
                    had been arounhe was in his sixties at that time. Yet, he became ambassador
                    sometime later in Switzerland. He must have been well into his seventies. Still
                    a glamorous kind of gentleman. He had been governor of Connecticut at one time,
                    and lived an absolute mansion of an embassy residence. The old embassy building
                    was still downtown in a very nice location.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Anyway, I started trying to figure out how to do the job. It was clear the times
                    were changing. USIS in the past had traded on the economics of journalistic
                    poverty throughout the world. It is hard to imagine now, but there was a time
                    when most newspapers in most lesser developed countries didn't have wire
                    services. Either they couldn't afford them, or the communications didn't work
                    well, or they didn't want to be bothered with them. USIS' staple fare was what
                    was called the wireless file. This was a wire service that tried to cover the
                    news and U.S. policy, and provide feature services, and all sorts of things.
                    Selected articles, and sometimes the whole service, was provided free to
                    newspapers throughout the world. In a place like Bolivia it worked well.
                    Newspapers all over town would pick up articles and use them as if USIS were a
                    real wire service. It became clear to me was that that approach was not working
                    in Argentina. They had some good newspapers, and they had some lousy ones too.
                    The good papers had access to all sorts of wire services and weren't very
                    interested in our wireless file, and it seemed to me there was very little point
                    in working with the lousy ones. Our job was to have an impact, if we could, on
                    the bigger, most influential papers. I spent time studying what our output was,
                    and what we could do to be useful. I decided the wireless file was not going to
                    serve us very well. But at that time, USIA also had begun to put out the text of
                    speeches, and occasionally procure copyrighted articles. USIA would buy the
                    coprights on an article published someplace in thU.S. press that reflected
                    favorably on U.S. policy or illuminated an issue we felt was being misunderstood
                    overseas. The article would ten be offered to posts for placement in the local
                    press. I decided those two thingthe complete text of important speeches and
                    copyrighted articlewould work for us. Soon after my arrival, I managed to meet
                    Jacobo Timerman, who was the publisher oLa Opinion at that time, but later
                    became a famous author and political prisoner. La Opinion was a young newspaper
                    on the way up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work with him, and how would you describe
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: He kind of liked me, and I liked him. He was a very interesting
                    person. I just started talking to him about what he would be interested in. He
                    was interested in publishing the text of speeches, especially speeches by famous
                    people. He said “If you can get me a Kissinger speech fast enough so that I can
                    publish it before anybody else does, I'll be happy to do so.” You can't promise
                    on a speech by the Secretary, but you can work as fast as you can, and we worked
                    out arrangements with Washington to get these things pretty quickly. I can't
                    remember, we may have even done translations for him. He was also interested in
                    the copyright idea, which was an important idea, not because La Opinion couldn't
                    afford to pay for copyrights, but we saved them a lot of work. We saved them the
                    negotiations. He did publish some Kissinger speeches, and some copyrighted
                    articles, and these made USIS look pretty good. It was a good way to work and a
                    way of getting USIS off its dependence on what I had concluded was a dying
                    product at least as far as developed countries were concerned. The other
                    paperthe big traditional ones, La Prensa and La Naciowere not particularly
                    interested in publishing the full text of speeches, but they were interested in
                    the copyrighted articles. Again, they could afford to buy the rights, but we
                    could save them time and effort both in identifying articles and securing the
                    rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought in '72 to '74, when the attention of
                        the White House focused on Latin America, which was seldom, that Chili would
                        have dominated it. At least we were anti Allende. Did this cause problems
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember that it did. I don't remember that people were so
                    sure, at that point, that we were absolutely anti Allende. Argentina is a very
                    self absorbed country. What Argentina was interested in was when the Lanusse
                    government was going to wind down. People thought the end was in sight, and
                    people thought they saw elections coming, and they thought they saw elections
                    meaning the return of Peron. That was the topic. What Peron was doing in Spain
                    was much more interesting than what Allende was doing in Santiago.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Times had changed. While we still didn't think much of Peroand rightly
                    swe couldn't be anti elections. That has often been what has gotten us into
                    trouble in Latin America. We've at times paid lip service to the idea of
                    elections when we were really interested in much more self centered short term
                    political goals. That lukewarm support for democracy often plopped us into bed
                    with dumb dictators. Fortunately, our cover story about democracy eventually
                    saved us.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The lesson for U.S. policy is to be very careful of your cover story because it
                    may well come true. When you have repeated the cover story enough, eventually
                    the press, Congress and public opinioboth at home and abroabeat you into coming
                    through on what you said you would do or support. That is why we had to support
                    elections regardless of an almost inevitable result.</p>
                <p>There is a corollary which has to do with how you react to the other person's
                    cover story. If your adversary is saying things that you like and support, even
                    if you know he is lyindon't call him a liar. Eventually you and your political
                    allies and the press and public opinion may be able to beat him into coming
                    clean on his cover story.</p>
                <p>So we looked with some traditional reservations about the return of Peronism to
                    Argentina, but on the other hand we had to be in favor of elections, and in
                    favor of a government that had some popular support. And the country had its
                    share of problems that needed to be addressed. The truth about military
                    dictatorships is not that they are strong, but that they are weak. They can't
                    solve real problems because they don't have parliamentary mechanisms to let them
                    know when they are screwing up and when they are getting it right. A trial
                    balloon doesn't tell you much if nobody dares shoot at it. So they spend all
                    their time tending their offshore bank accounts and looking over their shoulders
                    wondering what is going to happen to them. Therefore, they become profoundly
                    conservative in the sense that they are actually afraid to try anything new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent four years in Greece when the Colonels were
                        running the place, and you would have thought they might have come up with
                        some social things. The Greeks are difficult to control, but what the hell,
                        as long as you have a military dictatorship you would think they could do
                        something. They didn't. While you were there, was the embassy getting any
                        information about Peron and trying to figure out where he was coming from
                        now that he was getting older?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, sure, there was a lot of attention paid to “what will Peron II
                    be like. Who are the people around him, and what are they like?” Basically, we
                    were caught in a machine. Elections were going to come, and that is eventually
                    what happened. The political opposition in Argentina, the Radicales, and people
                    more to the left, were also making peace with the notion of a return of
                    Peronism. They felt you could not govern Argentina without coming to terms with
                    the huge masses of people who still considered themselves Peron supporters.
                    There was no way to govern the country without coming to terms with Peronism,
                    and the way to do that was to let Peron come back. I remember asking Jacobo
                    Timerman what would La Opinion do when Peron came back. He said “We will help
                    Peron become what we think he ought to be.” That's what political forces do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other papers? La Prensa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: La Prensa was still very important. La Nacion was very important. La
                    Prensa was beginning to look a bit frayed, in the sense that it had become a
                    monument. The Gainza Paz family had very courageously stood up to Peron in the
                    forties, but paid the price for it. They still enjoyed great respect in
                    Argentina, but I think the paper was not quite “with it” the way La Nacion and
                    La Opinion were trying to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these responsible papers? I'm talking about the major
                        papers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: There were a slew of junky tabloids, but La Nacion and La Prensa were
                    certainly representative of a very strong tradition in Latin America of family
                    owned, moderately conservative newspapers. You can go through the big cities of
                    Latin America and find this pattern repeats itself. They are conservative, but
                    not crazy conservative. They sort of think democracy is a good idea, although
                    they have doubts about it working in their country. They sort of like the United
                    States. At least they like the idea of the United States; sometimes they don't
                    like the practice of the United States. They like the American system of
                    government, but they don't like American society very muctoo disorderly and just
                    a bit vulgar. Nevertheless these papers and their like throughout Latin America
                    deserve some credit for having kept alive democratic traditions. They are part
                    of the reason why almost all Latin American politicians, no matter how brutally
                    authoritarian, pay lip service to democracy. Remember what I said about cover
                    stories coming true. I think that the fact that we are now looking at a
                    democratic Latin America is partly due to the basic decency of those papers and
                    the families that ran them. The countries of Latin America owe a debt to them
                    for having survived just out of sheer stubbornness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Argentina, was there much life from your point of view,
                        beyond the boundaries of the city? One doesn't hear much about the interior
                        of Argentina.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's a really good question. The truth is that Buenos Aires
                    dominates the rest of the country and its a big country to dominate. All the
                    railroad lines, for example, terminate in Buenos Aires. The British built them
                    that way. Despite all that seacoast Buenos Aires is the only port that counts
                    for anything. Maybe residents of Buenos Aires are called portenopeople of the
                    porbecause there's no other port worth mentioning. There's an old joke that says
                    a porteno is really an Italian who speaks Spanish and thinks he is an
                    Englishman. To understand Argentina, you almost have to think of the southern
                    cone of South America as a distinct entity that shares patterns of immigration
                    and characteristic with the other countries of the temperate climate southern
                    hemisphere. We are used to thinking of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa
                    as products of late eighteenth and nineteenth century immigration. It's a little
                    harder for us to see a similar process in the southern cone because we only see
                    our own Hollywoodized version of Mexican history. First there was Indoamerica
                    and then the Spaniards came and they were really tough so everybody had to speak
                    Spanish. Mexico is of course much more complicated than that and what happened
                    in the southern cone, including southern Brazil was even more complicated.</p>
                <p>In the seventeenth century the Spaniards, and Portuguese took control of
                    relatively weak native American cultures and imposed their own models of urban
                    and agricultural life, as well as their own mining industries. But beginning in
                    the second half of the nineteenth century while we were collecting Europe's
                    huddled masses, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and even little Paraguay and
                    impoverished Bolivia were attracting middle class immigrants from southern
                    Europe and the middle east who came with education, modern commercial and
                    industrial know how and capital. They were people looking for land and
                    commercial opportunity and had, or could get, the money to finance it. As people
                    of the Mediterranean basin they were attracted to the Latin, Catholic cultures
                    of South America. There were of course some northern European immigrants as well
                    but many fewer.</p>
                <p>Those waves of immigrants basically transformed the cultures and economies of
                    Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and southern Brazil. If you were to draw a line across
                    the continent from just north of Sao Paulo, Brazil to Santiago, Chile everywhere
                    below that line is a part of southern cone culture that shares characteristics
                    with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. These are countries that are
                    economically capable of feeding, clothing and arming themselves and are
                    therefore the most independent countries in the world. Consequently, they have a
                    tendency not to pay a great deal of attention to the rest of the world, nor to
                    care much what the rest of the world thinks of them. Think of the outrageous,
                    nose thumbing behavior oSouth Africa with apartheid, Chile during the Pinochet
                    regime, and Argentina with the dirty war of the seventies and the invasion of
                    the Falklands. Even New Zealand had its own mild outrageousness when it
                    confronted the U.S. concerning nuclear weapons aboard U.S. ships, a question
                    that other Asian nations or the Europeans never ask. I can't think of anything
                    particularly outrageous the Australians have done except win the America's Cup,
                    but I suspect their World War II trauma shocked them out of some of their sense
                    of independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I think the notion that they don't pay attention is important. Under Peron, who
                    admired Mussolini, Argentina initiated an experiment with fascism in 1945.
                    That's a pretty good example of not paying attention to what is going on in the
                    rest of the world. Buenos Aires had this weird, and often pleasant, sense of
                    entrenched nostalgia which I guess came from the tango, the big old fashioned
                    railroad stations and the 1930s quality of political discourse. It was a
                    romantic place in a kind of Casablanca way.</p>
                <p>So below that Sao Paulo Santiago line you have reasonably developed societies
                    that regard themselves as essentially European. They are not as European as they
                    think, but certainly more so than the rest of Latin America. As they say,
                    Santiago is farther from Washington than Moscow and the U.S. influence is not as
                    strong as in the Caribbean basin. We tend to forget that they did pretty well at
                    least up through the great depression. While Mexico was suffering through its
                    terribly destructive revolution, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and southern Brazil
                    were entering what could almost be called their golden age.</p>
                <p>Q: The Indians have been pretty well eliminated, haven't they?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The Indians of the pampas were pretty much eliminated in the
                    nineteenth century in wars reminiscent of what happened in the U.S., although
                    the famous gauchos are their mestizo descendants. In the north of Argentina, the
                    Salta region there are some of the same Andean Indian groups that are found in
                    Bolivia and Chile. There are some remnants of Patagonian tribes in the far South
                    of Chile, so there may be some in Argentina, but I don't really know. Indians
                    simply don't figure in Argentina's modern vision of itself and neither do blacks
                    although both Indians and blacks played historic roles in the nation's
                    development. How did I get into all of these unsupported generalizations?</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not much. There were the remnants of an AID program that had to do
                    with housing guarantees, but nothing new. There was no Peace Corps. There was a
                    story, probably apocryphal, that when Argentina was offered the Peace Corps
                    during the Kennedy years, they had asked, “Do you plan to send your Peace Corps
                    to France?” and then turned it down.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not much. USIS kept a small presence in Cordova, Rosario, Tucuman and
                    Mendoza. I visited those cities occasionally. I don't think the United States
                    government was reaching out very strongly into the provinces of Argentina. Our
                    game was in Buenos Aires.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Occasionally, but not much. My bailiwick was the press. When I had
                    contact with government officials it was with some American VIP visit, of which
                    we had our share. I remember spending some time with the Argentine navy because
                    I was the project officer for the visit of a naval ship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I didn't spend a great deal of time with the universities. We were
                    probably too specialized. We were a big post and that tends to make you
                    specialize. The cultural section of the USIS did that sort of thing. I
                    occasionally talked to journalism professors and made some university visits,
                    but I don't have a strong feeling for the universities themselves. Nor do I have
                    sense that the press was particularly interested in the universities as a source
                    of their training. It was more a “we'll get them young and train them ourselves”
                    kind of thing.</p>

                        military might do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The military was seen by the embassy at that point as having run out
                    of energy. We could see they weren't going to be the government much longer. The
                    higher ups in the Army had decided to get out of power and were looking for a
                    way to do it. In the first part of my tour, terrorism from the left had begun a
                    little bit. There were some kidnapings and bombings and you could see the
                    reaction in the army begin to set in. My guess is that as the military began to
                    wind down its governmental role, that's when the death squads and hard liners
                    began to take on an extracurricular, non official, and very vicious approach. At
                    least I think that at the beginning it was non official. The trouble with that
                    kind of activity throughout Latin America goes back to what I said about the
                    basic weakness of military dictators. Even when they know better, or are under
                    serious international pressure, the last thing they want to do is take on the
                    hard liners in their own institution, because they have very little idea of what
                    kind of support they might have elsewhere. What makes it worse is that the
                    longer they are in power the more dependent they become on support from their
                    own military institutions and therefore all the more vulnerable to bone headed
                    hard liners.</p>

                        people. Were they looking at Europe or were they looking more at the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Traditionally, most southern cone institutions, including the press,
                    looked toward Europe for their models. But by the time I was there, even before
                    the excitement about the investigative reporting of Watergate, the press was
                    beginning to look more and more at the United States. I think the model of U.S.
                    journalism was beginning to look more distinctive and different from Europe, and
                    perhaps more attractive. I think that was less true of La Prensa, but more true
                    of La Nacion and La Opinion, although Timerman would tell you that his model was
                    Le Monde.</p>
                <p>There was also the question of how to cover the overpowering importance of
                    developments in the United States. They thought they could not be really great
                    newspapers unless the figured out how to cover the United States well. The
                    questions for the papers was can we afford to keep permanent correspondents in
                    the United States or is it better to pick up stringers? Or is it better to let
                    the embassy let the U.S. embassy provide us stuff from the United States? The
                    answer tended to be a combination of all three. I found them to be very open to
                    us. A good press embassy press officer can actually help an editor determine if
                    his correspondent is doing a good job, which means covering the right things.
                    People up to the level of publishers, and certainly reporters, were more than
                    willing to talk to us.</p>
                <p>We also had a good press attach? who was covering the ambassador. Ambassador
                    Lodge was a very visible kind of person. He had a lot of contact with the press
                    himself, and the press attach?, Jack DeWitt, was very kind about sharing his
                    contacts with me and referring people to me. We talked about things that might
                    back up what the ambassador was trying to do so he could get a more effective
                    package. My job there was not so much to follow political events as it was to
                    get stuff into the papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with putting things in that
                        would make you wince?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I didn't have anybody looking over my shoulder and saying “Did you see
                    that piece in the wireless file? That is really a good piece and I want you to
                    go out and get that placed.” Getting something placed was our term for
                    convincing a paper to publish something we provided. I was given a lot of
                    freedom and I didn't place things that would make me wince. I figured if it made
                    me wince, it would make other people wince, so what would be the point? I think
                    one of the defects of USIS over the years was to have had a lot of high powered,
                    persuasive information officers who wanted to get credit for placing lots of
                    column inches and would go in and browbeat an editor into publishing something
                    the editor doesn't want to publish. To me, that is short circuiting a system you
                    ought to make work for you. Unless you think the editor is an idiot, you ought
                    to pay attention when he doesn't want to publish something from us. He may well
                    think his readers, or his publisher, or his advertisers will not like it much.
                    He will make judgments that help him keep his job and increase the circulation
                    and profitability of his paper. Since we share at least a part of those goals we
                    should pay attention to his judgment. If we don't share in those goals, why
                    would be working with that paper? There are of course some very partisan
                    publications that we may work with tactically, I suppose, but that really does
                    involve a different set of calculations.</p>
                <p>So, we were getting out of the days when the effectiveness of the USIS press
                    officer was measured in column inches. It was a very tempting kind of measure
                    because it was quantifiable and easily documented. It also gave the people in
                    Washington who produced the Wireless File a way to gauge their product. The
                    trouble was that it was not a good measure of success in the field. Lots of
                    column inches in a lousy paper, an ideological rag, or low circulation
                    newsletter could be quite meaningless or even counterproductive. I felt my job
                    was to identify the papers with clout over issues of concern to U.S. foreign
                    policy and concentrate my efforts on them.</p>
                <p>At any rate we were still using the Wireless File in a kind of routine way. The
                    chief national employee, an excellent journalist named Alberto Shtirbu and I
                    would look at the file in the morning and decide which pieces should be
                    distributed generally and which might be offered as an “exclusive” to a
                    particular paper. We got decent results although no where near the column inches
                    that could be racked up in a country like, just for example, Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of USIA then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was Jim Keogh</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Nixon administration, so you think of
                        Kissinger, but did USIA feel they had a heavy hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well eventually USIA and especially VOA felt that Nixon administration
                    had a very heavy hand. But I don't believe we felt that way in Argentina during
                    the time I was there. As for Kissinger and the State Department, if somebody
                    aske“What have you done to support U.S. foreign policy?” I could say, “Hey, we
                    got the whole text of the Kissinger speech published the next day in a major
                    daily. What more would you want?” Or, “You know that great copyrighted article
                    by George Kennan, or whoever the hell it was, we got that published in the
                    Sunday supplement of such and such a paper verbatim.” That stuff would make us
                    look great. It not only was effective policy support, it was easy to convince
                    people who were paying attention in Washington that it was effective policy.
                    Fortunately, Gene Friedman, the head of USIS, and Jim Miller, the chief of the
                    Information Section, understood that things were changing, and that publishing a
                    nice little feature article on irrigation methods in the southwestern United
                    States, or the wonders of the national park system in the United States, didn't
                    mean a damn thing in Argentina. It didn't mean very much any place else, either.
                    I never met anybody in Latin America who said I'm opposed to the U.S. because
                    you don't know anything about irrigation or have crummy national parks. It was
                    our foreign policy - especially Vietnam - that was the problem at that time, and
                    that's what we had to work on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the major Argentine papers have a permanent
                        representative in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, some, I think some part timers. They weren't persons who were
                    zinging stuff down there every day but they did have people they could turn to.
                    Occasionally they would send people up there and the USIA foreign press centers
                    in Washington and New York were beginning to function at that time, I think.
                    They certainly were a couple of years later when I was in Brazil. They were
                    pretty good. For a person coming cold into Washington representing a Latin
                    American newspaper, they really were extremely helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They were one of USIA's best ideas ever. The Washington center is
                    located here in the National Press building. It was a place where a journalist
                    could go and get a desk and a telephone, access to a teletype and telex, and
                    help in making contacts. It was mainly staffed by USIS officers who had gotten
                    to be pretty good in Washington and knew how to help. They were a major resource
                    for people like me in the field.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think coverage of Argentina or any place in Latin America would be a
                    sometime thing by a major newspaper in the United States. You might have one
                    correspondent who might roam the whole hemisphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, although some of those were stationed in Buenos Aires. Some were
                    stationed in Chile. Actually the pattern at that time for major U.S. media
                    organizations probably had one person covering South America and another
                    handling Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. U.S. journalists were not
                    particularly my responsibility. The PAO, IO and press attach? handled contacts
                    with the U.S. press. We also had a Voice of America correspondent stationed in
                    Buenos Aires at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there news magazines like Newsweek, Time, that
                        equivalent? Were these important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, and they also worked with us. Almost every country in Latin
                    America at that time had a sort of Time magazine clone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a segment of the press working on anti
                        Americanism, or was that much of an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Extreme violent Anti Americanism was not a big deal except on the
                    radical student left. Of course there was a sort of residual anti Americanism
                    among the most militant old fashioned Peronists as well as the sort of
                    resentful, cultural anti Americanism of right wingers. I was represented the
                    embassy at some kind of parade in a Buenos Aires neighborhood. I was standing on
                    the reviewing stand, and at one point a bunch of students came running down the
                    middle of the parade yelling slogans and singing “Get the Yankees out of Latin
                    America.” The Argentines with us on the were a good deal more embarrassed than I
                    was. There were a couple of kidnapings of American business men at that time;
                    but those were mainly big money operations. Everything that happened after that
                    in Argentina was really horrible. The death squads. You have to remember there
                    was a left which was also very willing to do very nasty stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this hadn't really developed while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, but it was coming. Eventually, the elections came and the embassy
                    went into great embassy like spasms of covering the elections and trying to
                    predict the elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That always seems to be a game you play.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Even if we could predict, 24 hours in advance, the outcome of the
                    elections, what difference would it make? What would we really do about it? The
                    answer during my career was just about nothing. So why all the effort?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people who
                        say, “And we predicted the election right down to where it was.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It's not exactly a benign quirk of our culture though. It's a bit
                    dangerous. It makes you look real nosy. I've been in embassies where people try
                    to organize a pool to see who can predict the winners and/or the percentages.
                    I've always counseled unsuccessfully against that because either the fact of the
                    poll or the results would get out to the press. That could have awful
                    consequences. Even leaving polls aside, I think we need to be very careful in
                    our election coverage, because if you question too closely, too often, to many
                    people it looks like manipulation. In Argentina that was the last thing we want
                    to be accused of, especially if you go back in history to the famous election
                    when the election slogans was “Braden o Peron,”“Braden or Peron.” Spruille
                    Braden was the American ambassador. Peron won the election.</p>
                <p>To its credit, the embassy in Buenos Aires, in my time, leaned over backwards to
                    not take any position whatsoever. The fact is, in order to look like you are
                    doing nothing, you really have to almost do nothing. You know, we like to talk
                    about public vs. private or traditional diplomacy. The apparent distinction has
                    been convenient to USIA over the years. But the distinction is really kind of
                    phony, in that “private diplomacy” is a kind of retrofitted term like digital
                    watch or acoustic guitar. We didn't need the term until we started talking about
                    public diplomacy. The trouble with the notion is the implication that
                    traditional diplomacy is always sort of a secret. Of course it isn't. Diplomacy
                    is a public function which, only for brief periods, and for very good tactical
                    reasons, can be practiced in secret. When you are keeping all those secrets you
                    had better be smart enough to figure out what you are going to do when it all
                    comes out. Unless you are dealing with something that nobody cares about, the
                    end result of any diplomatic effort is public. We need to rid ourselves of the
                    illusion that we have much secrecy to work with. I think in Argentina at that
                    time, we did it pretty well. There were no really credible accusations that the
                    U.S. government was messing about in the outcome of the Argentine elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Brazil loom heavily at that time? Was there concern or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Brazil always looms heavily in the Argentine consciousness. Argentina,
                    however, does not loom heavily in the Brazilian consciousness. There is a great
                    difference in size. I don't think there was much feeling in Argentina that
                    Brazil was particularly concerned with, or of a mind to do anything about, the
                    elections. I don't think anybody in Brazil was messing about in the Argentine
                    elections.</p>
                <p>There always were people on both of the political extremes that would claim
                    somebody was messing around in their elections. The left claiming the Americans
                    were messing about, or the far nutty right claiming the freemasons were trying
                    to throw the elections, but it wasn't taken seriously.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The elections were held and the Peronists won. No matter what you thought about
                    the result, you had to feel when the tallies were finally in, that Buenos Aires
                    was a very happy city. There were people in the streets, there was a lot of good
                    humor, and there was a certain feeling that maybe they could bring off a
                    successful government. Maybe the Peronists wouldn't be all that hard for us to
                    deal with. Eventually, that was the case. Now we are looking at the last days of
                    the Menem government and a smooth transition to a person that really represents
                    the Old radical party. Eventually, it was a nice outcome, but it didn't work
                    that way right away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Peron came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes. Yes, I was. The best way to describe it is to tell an Argentine
                    political joke. When Peron came back to Argentina he really suffered from three
                    basic misconceptions. One he thought that Gelbard, who was his current minister
                    of finance, was Miranda, who had been his first minister of finance. Secondly,
                    he thought that Isabelita was Evita (his first and second wives). Thirdly, and
                    worst of all, he thought that he was Peron.</p>
                <p>It turned out to not be a very effective administration. But everybody was
                    patient with that. He had some decent talent around him, but he had some very
                    suspicious characters around him also. I don't remember how many months it was,
                    but Keiko and I had planned to take home leave and return to Buenos Aires. After
                    all I had season tickets for the opera at the Colon Theater, at a very
                    reasonable price, and owned one of the best sailboats I've ever had in my life.
                    We went on home leave and went to Ohio to be with my folks, and Peron died
                    during that time. With the evolution of events it ended up with Isabelita taking
                    over the government. In the meantime, I got a call from Washington asking me if
                    I would be willing to go as the information officer at the American Consulate in
                    Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Malvinas/Falklands raise any eyebrows?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, it was there, but talking about the Malvinas in Argentina was like
                    talking about returning to the sea in Bolivia. These issues are all over Latin
                    America. It is easy to miscalculate because Americans basically don't take those
                    issues seriously, therefore they don't think the local people really take them
                    seriously, and we are usually wrong about that. The Argentines obviously took
                    them very seriously. You would be careful to say Malvinas instead of Falklands
                    when you talked about it to Argentines. The U.S. policy position was one of
                    these absolutely inconclusive, “Well we think the two parties should reach a
                    mutually acceptable solution.” That's like saying nothing, which is what we
                    intended to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I've also got to talk about a change in ambassadors in Argentina. Lodge
                    eventually left under great protest. He really didn't want to leave. He was
                    replaced by Robert Hill. A businessman, and now I can't remember from where. I
                    also didn't describe the social life of the embassy under Lodge. It was quite
                    extraordinary in terms of receptions. One of the first receptions I went to, I
                    was told I had to help the ambassador in the reception line. The ambassador was
                    famous for picking fairly tall people and having them stand near him in the line
                    and ask everybody's name, then introduce them to the ambassador. Kind of a major
                    doom kind of job. I was exceedingly uncomfortable doing that.</p>
                <p>I also remember being the control officer for a visit by two astronauts. That's a
                    wonderful term we use in the foreign service - control officer. I actually tried
                    to get rid of the term in San Salvador, with no success. I always figured that
                    the VIPs you are taking care of don't really like the idea of being “controlled”
                    and would find that fairly objectionable. I always thought “liaison” might be a
                    better term. Anyway, I was the person for a visit by the astronauts Jim Lovell
                    and Deke Slayton. Lovell had been the Apollo 13 commander, and Slayton was the
                    ex test pilot astronaut's astronaut who had missed a moon mission due to a heart
                    murmur. We had a great time taking them around to air bases and meeting all
                    sorts of people. Somehow they had left for Santiago, but got turned around and
                    had to come back. I don't remember why, but Keiko and I ended up being invited
                    to the upstairs dining room at the residence with the Lodges and the astronauts
                    and their wives. It was an absolutely wonderful evening. Lodge, undeterred by
                    the presence of two astronauts, monopolized much of the conversation. But he was
                    a very charming and funny person, and interesting when reminiscing about
                    politics. The funniest moment, though, was when Jim Lovell was describing the
                    Apollo 13 mission, and talking about the disaster of the onboard explosion. When
                    Lovell talked about having to turn the ship around on the other side of the
                    moon, Lodge said, “Well, I don't know how you would do that, because that thing
                    doesn't have a rudder on it.” Lovell, using a model of the spacecraft, explained
                    how the little jets on the module would turn the whole thing. Lodge did not seem
                    convinced. Then they got all the way around the moon and they were back into
                    getting ready to reenter the atmosphere, and Lovell was explaining how they had
                    achieved the right angle to come in so they wouldn't skip off or burn up.
                    Talking about how they had to orient the craft by looking at stars, and damned
                    if Lodge didn't ask the same question again, “Well, how do you steer that thing?
                    It doesn't have a rudder on it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a change when Hill came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, he wasn't nearly as flamboyant and didn't speak the beautiful
                    Spanish that Lodge spoke. Lodge was really good in Spanish. Sometimes you wished
                    he didn't speak as good Spanish as he did, because you couldn't always be sure
                    he would say the right things.</p>
                <p>Needless to say, things changed quite a bit with Hill. But I wasn't there very
                    long after he came.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go to Sao Paulo, 1974 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That was 1974 to 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Sao Paulo like when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sao Paulo is, and was, one of the biggest cities in the world. It is a
                    really big, tough, and smart city. It is part of the southern cone phenomenon,
                    the result of a huge amount of immigration in the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth century. Italians, Spaniards, Portuguesall sorts of folks plus about a
                    million ethnic Japanese. Most of these people started down on the farm, but many
                    now live in the big city and are lawyers and doctors. Sao Paulo is the
                    industrial center of Brazil, almost to an embarrassing extent. You have the very
                    underdeveloped northeast, tropical, with a heavy population of poor folks of
                    African originbasically people brought as slaves to Brazil. Brazil abolished
                    slavery even later than the United States did. Rio in the center; Great port,
                    great entrepot, great international city.</p>
                <p>But Sao Paulo state is traditionally where most of industrialized work gets done.
                    Again, part of that Europeanized southern portion of Brazil. A lot of Japanese,
                    huge number of Germans and Yugoslavs. Curitiba, to the South of Sao Paulo, is
                    the only city I have ever been in Latin America where you can go in the airport
                    and your luggage may be carried by some person that looks like he came out of a
                    Breugel painting. A rather successful part of Latin America. High standards of
                    living, high per capita income, a lot of money to be made, a lot of progress, a
                    lot of big buildings, a lot of big newspapers. And then you have Brasilia, way
                    off in the middle of nowhere, as the capital of the country.</p>
                <p>As the Brazilian body politic, trying to center itself in Brasilia, worries about
                    the overwhelming power of Sao Paulo state, I had the feeling that occasionally
                    the American Embassy and USIS in Brasilia worried about the overwhelming power
                    of the Consulate General in Sao Paulo where most of the money and most of the
                    national press was.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it is a place where we have often assigned a consulate general there and
                    then he became an ambassador elsewhere. I've been reading a book about the
                    Brazilians, and it says that Sao Paulo is a business city, that there are no
                    marks of cultural interest or beauty there.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: It's written by somebody from Rio, no doubt. We live in an unjust
                    world. Anybody who has spent time in the third world has gotten very used to
                    being patient with “Well, we don't have a lot of material progress here, but we
                    have strong spiritual, esthetic, and intellectual values. The notion is, there
                    is a bargain somehow. You can have one or the other but you can't have both. The
                    cruel truth, which nobody wants to say, because it's so damned mean, is that,
                    “Yes, you can have both.” The truth is they usually go together. The fact is
                    that Sao Paulo has most of the industry in Brazil; it has most of the money in
                    Brazil; it also has the best art museums in Brazil; it also has the best
                    orchestras in Brazil; it also has the best universities in Brazil. Too bad that
                    isn't fair, but it is true. The Sao Paulo art museum is really very good. The
                    symphony, and I've spent a lot of time with symphony orchestras and operas, is
                    not quite as good as Buenos Aires, but they do quite well. Rio is an absolutely
                    delightful city, and I enjoyed every minute I spent there, but it is a city
                    where it is fun to play, but Sao Paulo, in terms of the substance of work, is a
                    much more interesting place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Fred Chapin. Do you know Fred?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I know of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Fred died about two years ago. He had cancer. He was a good consul
                    general and a good friend. The political counselor was Tony Freeman, who I had
                    known in Bolivia. He eventually become the State Department's labor advisor, and
                    now represents the ILO (International Labor Organization) here in Washington.
                    The BPAO (Branch Public Affairs Officer, chief of any non capitol city USIS
                    post) was Don Mathes. My duties expanded because there were now only about five
                    officers at post. USIS posts were still pretty big in those days. There was a
                    BPAO, an IO (Information Officer), and a CAO (cultural Affairs Officer), and a
                    couple of assistant CAOs to help with educational exchange and things like that.
                    I had the full range of press activities, meaning that whatever had to be done
                    with radio, whatever had to be done with television, plus the printed press,
                    plus minor spokesman's duties at times, was my job. The consulate was supposed
                    to keep its public mouth shut and leave that sort of adult work to the embassy.
                    That in itself presented a problem, because the papers that asked the questions
                    weren't in Brasilia, they were in Sao Paulo, and to some extent in Rio. Again, I
                    was lucky to make some good contacts early, at a couple of the papers that
                    really counted. I continued to work along the lines that had worked well for me
                    in Buenos Aires, and that was to work with the big, weighty, elite press. That
                    was where the audience was that had any impact on decisions involving U.S.
                    foreign policy. Right away I was introduced to a person named Rui Placido
                    Barbosa, who was a young journalist, sort of chief of staff to Rui Mesquita, who
                    was the owner and publisher of the Estado de Sao Paulo. Estado de Sao Paulo is
                    probably the biggest, toughest, smartest newspaper in Brazil. Often known as
                    Estadao, the big Estado, it was a newspaper, like La Prensa in Argentina, that
                    had established its own milestones in the battle against censorship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far were we into the military government at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: About ten years. I think it started about '63 or '64. It was a well
                    entrenched military government and we were into a period of heavy censorship of
                    the press. The initial deal the military offered Estado was “We trust you
                    persons to practice self censorship.” Estado replied: “No way, we will not
                    censor ourselves. However, we have to think of the practicalities of publishing
                    a newspaper. We suggest that you appoint censors and we will make room for them
                    in our newsroom. That way you can do what you have to do even though we don't
                    like it, but we can still publish a timely newspaper.” It was a very clever
                    scheme because every time any even slightly important foreigner would visit the
                    paper, the publishers would take them to the newsroom and say, “Here is our so
                    and so editor and here is our censor. Stand up and say hello.” They also
                    developed a wonderful way of pointing out when they had been cut. When a censor
                    would cut something out, they would publish in its place a few quatrains of
                    Camoes Lusiadas, a classic of Portuguese literature. That is about like
                    producing a few verses of Paradise Lost on the front page of your newspaper. It
                    would look nutty. But there it was, and it was Estados' way of fighting back and
                    saying, “There was something here you weren't supposed to read so you can read
                    poetry instead.” Estado kept chipping away at censorship and the censors, and
                    finally, on some anniversary or another of the paper's, the government said
                    that, as a gift to Estado, they were going to remove their censors. Estado and
                    the Mesquita family basically won their battle against censorship. It was a
                    great victory, and they won it by being smart. They had a sense of humor and a
                    sense of irony. Nobody went to jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the rest of the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: There was a very good number two paper called Folha. It was a good
                    second paper. In most capitals of Latin America it would have been a good first
                    paper. There was a Time Magazine style magazine called Veja, which was extremely
                    good. They were equal to most European papers, and I think better than many
                    European papers.</p>
                <p>Estado for example, took great pride in publishing the State of the Union address
                    of the American President, in Portuguese, at the same time that it was published
                    in the United States. This required strenuous efforts on the part of my office.
                    This was in the days when we were still operating on teletypes. We had to set up
                    a system of actually taking it off section by section, four or five pages at a
                    time, and motorcycling it to the Estado offices where their team of translators
                    would go to work on it. They really did publish it the next morning in
                    Portuguese. It was a great accomplishment, and illustrated Estado's commitment
                    to covering the United States. Estado did maintain a permanent correspondent in
                    the United States, a person that would come back to Brazil every now and then.
                    Estado was also interested in some of the copyrighted articles that I had.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The main trick to working with them was speed. Speed was hard in those days.
                    There was no system to get the information to us quickly, we were still
                    operating on a 24 hour turnover cycle, but that wasn't good enough in Sao Paulo.
                    You couldn't have 24 hour delay and be relevant, except of course in feature
                    articles. We worked hard to get various papers the best stuff we could, and we
                    worked hard to answer questions. Again, the game was to get them to call us up.
                    When someone was working on a story, and had a question about the United States
                    they didn't have the answer to - call us up. I had some fights with Brasilia
                    over this, whether I had to go through them to get to the United States to
                    answer a question. Brasilia would tap dance over the issue, but they finally
                    recognized that I had to move fast and get information quickly if we were to
                    have any influence. I think in terms of influencing the press, which was my job,
                    I think it was a fairly successful time in Brazil. I stayed in Brazil three
                    years.</p>
                <p>Big political issues? You're not supposed to have big political issues when
                    you're in a consulate general. Nuclear proliferation issues were up. There were
                    concerns about nuclear reprocessing plants in Brazil. Drug issues were about to
                    come up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have a feeling the military rulers at that time would go
                        off on tangents of trying to build fairly impressive things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I guess so, but of course the most impressive project of all was
                    Brasilia, initiated under a civilian government. But, I suppose Brazil's biggest
                    developmental dream of all was the Amazon, and you could already see the rising
                    tensions between the desire to develop the Amazon and the desire to protect the
                    Amazon as well as all the problems of the treatment of native people in the
                    Amazon region. Those were very tough issues, and they are still around. They are
                    not going to go away quickly.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the impact of communications technology, I remember seeing a
                    televised ceremony where the leader of a tribal group in the Amazon was meeting
                    with a Brazilian official. They were talking about treaties and other things.
                    What caught my attention that the tribal leader had a tape recorder over his
                    shoulder. He was going to take the talks back with him in a way that would have
                    a different impact than in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude, where you were, towards the United

                <p>DIETERICH: I never heard that stuff. I suppose there are people who believe that
                    on the fringes, but they are not the people I dealt with. Maybe they are the
                    people I should have been dealing with. It's black helicopter stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about people in the United States who think
                        that somehow the United Nations is going to come in with black helicopters
                        and do Americans dirty. These are the survivalists and gun freaks in 1999
                        America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's right, and I'm sure there are Brazilians who believe these
                    things, that the United States has these great nefarious designs, but not
                    anybody I ever talked to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody pay much attention to the United States - was
                        it a subject of conversation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely, sure, but the Brazilian attitude toward the United States,
                    I think, is much different from the attitude in the Spanish speaking countries
                    of Latin America. Spanish speaking countries were more subject to dependency
                    theories, even Argentina. You know, the litany that goes, “Oh, the United States
                    is going to dominate us no matter what, and if we are poor and underdeveloped it
                    is because they did it to us.” All this kind of theory that is really out of
                    fashion now. Brazilians never really thought that way. Brazilians see themselves
                    in a different league. They are in the Indonesia, India league of emerging
                    nations that are going to be something in the future. They do believe that about
                    themselves. They see themselves as a big country and like the United States in
                    some ways. They look somewhat with condescension on the Spanish speaking
                    countries. It's almost an attitude that says, “Well, we Brazilians and you
                    Americans, we really do have to keep an eye on these banana republics around us,
                    but they are nothing we have to worry about too much, and we should have our own
                    relationship.”</p>
                <p>Brazil runs hot and cold on whether it wants to be part of Latin America or not.
                    There are two lines of thinking: One says, “We want to be part of Latin America
                    but we are the center and the most important country and we really ought to run
                    things.” The other says, “No, no, we are in a different league, part of the
                    emerging, big economies of the world, and that is where our future lies.” That
                    creates very different ways of thinking about the United States in Brazil. And
                    Brazilians too, it is basically a very optimistic place, especially in southern
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From time to time Brazil goes off on this inflation thing
                        that sounds, from a distance anyway, incredible. Where were you on the
                        inflation thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The economy was running pretty well. The cruzeiro at that time was
                    doing okay. Well, it was inflating somewhat. You didn't have a sense of economic
                    crisis, but you did have a sense of poverty. One of the problems with Sao Paulo
                    being where all the money is, is that it is also a magnet for people from the
                    impoverished Northeast who are desperate for work and education. Part of the
                    Brazilian government's answer to that over the years has been taxation schemes
                    that try to encourage industries to locate elsewhere, presumable nearer all
                    those people who need work...</p>

                <p>Q: How was the military government viewed at this time? We have been accused of
                    being too friendly with military governments in Latin America. How did this
                    translate?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were friendly with military governments for two reasons: they were
                    the powers that be, and they were anti Communist. You can't underestimate the
                    extent to which anti communism motivated U.S. policy through the '70s. There
                    were also a lot of nice middle class, liberal people with whom we were willing
                    to work, spend a lot of time with, and liked, who were trying to democratize
                    governments in Latin America. On balance we probably preferred democracies to
                    military dictatorships. We certainly, however, preferred military dictatorships
                    to the swing of the pendulum in the other direction. That was the one thing we
                    were not willing to risk and would fight against. Democracy took a back
                    seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see a threat from the left at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, I didn't see a particular threat from the left, but there were a
                    lot of people who did and I suppose some of those people were in our embassy in
                    Brasilia. Estado Sao Paulo was a very anti Communist newspaper. There were
                    revelations not long ago that at one time the CIA was paying Estado de Sao Paulo
                    to run anti Communist editorials. Maybe they were, but if so the agency was
                    wasting its money. That's like paying a bear to defecate in the woods. Estado
                    was going to run anti Communist editorials no matter what.</p>
                <p>We did make our alliances, both personal and political, with folks of a
                    conservative caste. And those people made their alliances with us. There were a
                    lot of nice, well off, well educated, comfortable people in Latin America who
                    were absolutely proud of their ties to the United States. But part of that
                    bargain was that we were seen as the bulwark against having all their stuff
                    taken away from them, or their parties crashed, by a bunch of disgruntled
                    workers and campesinos. That was a role with which we had grown way too
                    comfortable.</p>
                <p>When during the seventieespecially during the Carter administratiothat
                    traditional alliance between U.S. policy and wealthy conservatives began to
                    weaken, they really missed us. And they were really mad at us. They felt
                    betrayed. I ran into this even in Bolivia. Actually, all through Latin American
                    conservative circles there is a sense of betrayal from two places. They feel
                    they were betrayed by the United States, and they were betrayed by the Catholic
                    Church. Both were supposed to help protect their stuff, and both failed
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '74 to '77. Were you, as a member of
                        the consulate general's team, aware of what the Catholic Church was
                        doinliberation theology? Were we seeing the Catholic Church as a different
                        instrument than it had been before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, but we weren't quite sure what to make of it because it was a
                    little hard to spot in Brazil. Liberation theology in Brazieverything gets
                    blurred in Braziand if we look to the Catholic Church in its martyred form, it
                    was in Recife I guess. But Helder Camara was such a reasonable voice for a
                    responsible, social political role for the church. People in the embassy who
                    knew anything about him thought he was pretty good. They thought he was a
                    reasonable person.</p>
                <p>And remember that in 1977, with the election of Carter, we had a new
                    administration, a different kind of administration. We suddenly had a human
                    rights policy. Some people in the American Foreign Service establishment were
                    pedaling pretty hard to catch up at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about terrorism, was that a threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not a big issue, as I remember in Brazil. Terrorism, in the sense of
                    bombings, has never been a big issue there. Kidnaping, and the death squad
                    phenomenon that was invented in Brazil. One of the first high profile kidnapings
                    was our Ambassador Elbrick in Brazil. But those were not big issues in Brazil
                    when I was there. I mentioned the drug issue before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, what about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, that goes back a distressingly long way. In Brazil, I began as
                    the USIS information officer, working with the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency).
                    That was the first time I was at a post that had a DEA presence. Brazil was not
                    a producer country, and not a real big consumer country, but a big transit
                    point. If you think about western Brazil, that's a big outback out there, and
                    there are all sorts of ways to move drugs through that area. We were beginning
                    to put together information programs that basically tried to say “Hey, if you
                    are a producer or transit country, you are going to become users. Don't kid
                    yourself, because you cannot have this stuff in your country and not end up with
                    a drug problem similar to the one we have. All that money sloshing around in
                    your political system is also dangerous.” We are still trying to send those same
                    messages, and they are still not working very well, but they are good messages
                    and should make sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a killing of an American military officer who
                        was studying Portuguese in Sao Paulo. Was that on your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not on my watch, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with the Governor of Sao
                        Paulo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, I can remember meeting him, but I can't remember his name now.
                    Again, I would sit in on meetings and we would talk a lot about politics.
                    Occasionally, Tony Freeman and I would share a lunch with somebody we both
                    wanted to talk to. Basically, my concern was reporting the United States to
                    Brazil. I didn't feel a great obligation to spend a lot of time with politicians
                    either, to tell you the truth. Some USIS officers would disagree with that. They
                    think the function of an information officer is to communicate directly with
                    people. I didn't mind doing that, but it seemed more efficient to be able to
                    communicate through the press, and much more credible. And also through
                    television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Television was also on your docket by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it was, but we were not really into the satellite era, so we were
                    in an awkward stage of having film materials arrivthat were usually too late to
                    be of much usand that was handled through Rio. They had more active television
                    programming because Globo, the big Brazilian conglomerate was up there. My
                    counterpart in Rio, Jeff Biggs, did some good work in television. Again, the
                    relationship I was trying to cultivate was getting them to ask questions and
                    trying to get fast answers. It seemed to me that who you had to know in the
                    newsroom was not necessarily the person they told you had to know. You had to
                    figure out who was the person they asked when they had a question about the
                    United States. That was the person you had to know. You had to get him to say,
                    “Well, I don't know, but maybe the person over at the American Consulate
                    knows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've straddled it a bit between Argentina and Brazil, but
                        one of the most difficult stories in any country, to translate, would have
                        been Watergate and the fall of Nixon. I thought you would have had a
                        multitude of questions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I've glossed over that. I was in Washington when Nixon resigned. I
                    mentioned that when they decided to send me to Sao Paulo, Keiko went back to
                    Argentina to pack us out, but I went to FSI (Foreign Service Institute) to take
                    the transition course from Spanish to Portuguese.</p>
                <p>I happened to have gone out to visit a friend in the Voice of America newsroom on
                    the day that it happened. I would like to report there was great solemnity in
                    the Voice of America newsroom when Nixon finally made his speech, but you have
                    to remember that the Voice of America prides itself on its independence as a
                    journalistic identity, and the Voice of America also felt they had particularly
                    been victimized by the Nixon White House. There may have been about fifteen
                    seconds of solemnity followed by cheers, some ruder noises and a sense of “we're
                    glad your gone, you rascal you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I think a lot of people in Brazil thought Watergate was sort of nutty. In a way
                    they weren't really interested in it. It seemed like an American feud, and I
                    think a lot of Latin Americans were slow to pick up on how important it was. I
                    think they thought it would blow over. I think a lot of Brazilians did have a
                    “so what” attitude. One sector that did pay attention, however, was the press
                    itself. For publishers, like the Mesquitas of Estado, the Washington Post's role
                    was a fascinating example of the power of a big, privately owned daily. For
                    working stiff journalists it was an invigorating insight into the power of
                    investigative journalism. Watergate boosted the prestige of American journalism
                    way high, and a generation of younger journalists lived on Woodward and
                    Bernstein fantasies.</p>
                <p>A lot of foreign service Americans were very confused by Watergate. When I was
                    still in Argentina, I remember some very strong arguments within the embassy.
                    Once at some kind of an in house party some place, I remember a colleague
                    saying, “Well, you can't just have the president impeached. Who would run the
                    country?” Unable to think of anything smarter, I said, “The country would be run
                    by a bunch of people” to which he replied, “You can't have the government run by
                    a bunch of people.” So much for poor old Abe Lincoln.</p>
                <p>As to how we tried to handle Watergate with the Brazilian public, there is an old
                    unspoken USIS rule that says when the substance is really negative, talk about
                    process. It's really a pretty good rule that worked well with Watergate. We went
                    into considerable detail about the legal and procedural issues of the Watergate
                    process. While the conservatives I mentioned beforthey really did love Nixowere
                    further alienated from the U.S., political and academic folks in the center and
                    to the left began to take a new look at the U.S. The power of the U.S.
                    legislative branch and the press suggested ways to rid yourself of a bad
                    government without resorting to revolutionary violence. They began to realize
                    that the U.S. was much more complicated than the automatic anti communism to
                    which they had grown accustomed.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, she did. We have always had a few Japanese friends everyplace we

                    Sao Paulo. There is a whole neighborhood calleLiberdadLibertwhich was a Japanese

                    machines, and we would try to make them work, but they would never work. USIA
                    would suggest that we take it over to the offices of editors and play a press
                    conference for them, but I think a lot of us in the field resisted because we
                    lacked confidence in the machines. Imagine lugging the gear to a newspaper and
                    them having it not work. I remember once we had a conference, all of USIS
                    practically, in Rio, we got people from all over the country together to have
                    the audio visual experts of USIS Brasilia, demonstrate what wonderful machines
                    they were. They couldn't make them work either. The thing stopped working right
                    in the middle of the demonstration. Anyway, we weren't into video tapes, so
                    being able to go to a theater and see a Japanese movie was a wonderful break for
                    Keiko.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the Japanese community moving up into
                        positions of influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, yes, absolutely. The minister of mines and energy in Brazil was
                    ShigeakUeki, who was probably one of the most powerful Japanese in the world at
                    one point. There was probably tension at times. I remember, when I was leaving,
                    hearing a report that there was great concern at the University of San Paulo
                    Medical School. They had discovered that 80% of their entering class was ethnic
                    Japanese. If admissions are on merit, which they were, and you put Japanese in a
                    studying contest with Brazilians, I can tell you who is going to win. Although
                    one of my colleagues in San Paulo was a Japanese American, and one of the things
                    I remember him saying about Brazilian Japanese was, “In the United States it
                    takes two generations to ruin a good Japanese. In Brazil they do it in one
                    generation.”</p>
                <p>More recently, there have been interesting stories out of Japan. After things
                    began to turn downward in the Brazilian economy, and there were labor shortages
                    in Japan, a lot of Brazilian Japanese returned to Japan. They found it difficult
                    because most of them couldn't speak Japanese and they didn't really like
                    Japanese stuff very well, either. They liked Brazilian stuff. There were some
                    negative comments in the Japanese press about these noisy people and their
                    strange music and stinky food.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the first of December 1999. So in 1977 you went

                <p>DIETERICH: Right. Inter American Affairs.</p>

                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: To '79. Just about an even two year tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The main job was serving as the press representative for the bureau.
                    It really consisted of getting there very early in the morning, working with my
                    small staff and others to anticipate the questions that were apt to come up in
                    Hodding Carter's noontime briefing. Remember, Carter was the one that instituted
                    the notion of having the press briefing open to television, which made it a much
                    different affair than it had been in the past.</p>
                <p>Our job was to anticipate the questions, then either farm them out to others
                    within the bureau to write a guidance, or to write the guidance ourselves, then
                    to clear the guidance through whoever needed to clear it. A guidance was our
                    term of art for a sort mini script for the spokesman which had been agreed to by
                    the major elements of the Department interested in the question. This often
                    turned out to be quite a job. I had a staff of three people besides myself but
                    really only one other person who could write a guidance. You could anticipate
                    six or seven questions, and work had to start before I got to the office by
                    listening to as much news as you could absorb whilI ate breakfast, took a
                    shower, dressed and so on. Newspapers waited until I got to the office.</p>
                <p>That part of the job made me aware of NPR (National Public Radio) in terms of
                    agenda setting in Washington. I grew very dependent on it in terms of trying to
                    anticipate the questions. It caused me to think a lot about the media and the
                    fact that early morning radio news broadcasts in WashingtoNPR and to some extent
                    WTOare the agenda setters. A lot of people were doing what I was doing, one way
                    or another, including editors of newspapers and the editors of evening
                    television broadcasts, and senior officials of the government. They were
                    spending the first hour or so of their morning, including commuting time,
                    listening to radio, and radio was telling them what stories were news for that
                    day. That's power and influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>So, we would arrive in the office early and come to as quick an agreement we
                    could on what questions we could anticipate. The I would try to farm the
                    questions out to the appropriate experts in the bureau, but I always had to
                    leave time to get clearances. Clearance is another term of art. It means going
                    to other concerned offices of the department with a written guidancthe answer to
                    an anticipated questioand getting somebody, preferably a senior official, to
                    sign indicating that office's agreement with the answer.</p>
                <p>About 11:30, you had to be in front of Hodding Carter's desk with your guidances
                    in hand, ready to turn them in and answer any questions any doubts he might
                    have. Or if it was a really tough issue, to wait for him to make a few a calls
                    around town, or to various assistant secretaries, or to White House spokesman
                    Jody Powell, or whoever, to find out if it would really fly.</p>
                <p>You had to get very good at figuring out who could be trusted to get you a
                    guidance on time. Some people were good about it but others weren't. You quickly
                    found that if you were dealing with a person that was slow in generating a
                    guidance, you had to write it yourself and present him with a different, tougher
                    transaction. It was basically, “If you don't come up with something, I'm going
                    to go with this right here, as bad as it is.” That often worked or at least
                    scared slow writers into action. You would try to get it by 10:00 a.m. if you
                    could, because you often had a lot of clearances to do. To put it in its baldest
                    terms, when you were looking at issues that had to be cleared with Ambassador
                    Terry Todman, the assistant secretary for Latin America, and Pat Derian, who was
                    the assistant secretary for human rights, you realized you were going to be in a
                    considerable negotiation. This would often require a couple of trips between the
                    two offices to get it done. Needless to say, I got a lot of exercise. I spent a
                    lot of time running up and down the halls of the Department.</p>
                <p>Once the briefings were with the spokesman, most of the bureau press reps would
                    attend the noon briefing. It wasn't required, but it seemed to me a good idea to
                    get an real feel for how a particular guidance played. Besides, Hodding Carter's
                    briefings were fun to watch. He had an actor's sense of how to play a particular
                    question. Although I'm sure that the Department would prefer that all guidances
                    be read word for nuanced word, the point is often better made with a paraphrase
                    that sounds like it came from the spokesman's head. There are lots of ways to
                    read a guidance. Tone of voice can signal what is really serious stuff and what
                    is boiler plate we really don't care all that much about.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>There were all kinds of journalists in the briefing ranging from the most
                    seasoned big time pros through foreign correspondents just getting their feet on
                    the ground to special interest pseudo journalists who used the briefing as way
                    to attract attention to themselves and their various causes. I said various
                    causes but probably should have said silly causes. There was a Lyndon LaRouche
                    representative who kept trying to prove that the international drug trade was
                    run by Queen Elizabeth, the second, I guess, not the first. There was another
                    whose gig was to ferret out untruths told by the liberal media, by which he
                    meant almost everybody in the business. These loons were treated with unfailing
                    courtesy, which was the best way to put them down. Besides the were wasting the
                    press' time as much or more than they were ours.</p>
                <p>The briefing is a pretty good forum for professional gadflies. It not too hard to
                    come with a questions for which there is no good answer. For example: “Does the
                    U.S. have contingency plans for the invasion of Canada?” A yes answer might get
                    you headlines saying “U.S. Prepares to Invade Canada,” and a no answer could get
                    “Administration Leaves U.S. Northern Border Unprotected.” Once when faced with
                    such a question regarding probably Nicaragua, I had told Hodding a dumb old
                    dirty joke about the Pretzel Hold, a wrestling hold so twisted and ingenious
                    that the only was the victim could escape was by biting his own privates. The
                    term pretzel hold became a useful shorthand for a question we probably shouldn't
                    answer.</p>
                <p>By the way the answer to the Canada question is “We don't discuss our contingency
                    plans.” Trouble is, every now and then we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about issues in a minute. I've asked people the
                        question from time to time, “You've served here and there and what was your
                        impression about the bureaus?” One of the things that comes up quite often
                        is that the European and Near Eastern Bureaus are both on top of things. But
                        of them all, the American Republics Bureau usually ranks at the bottom
                        because they didn't do their homework on time, or they didn't get things
                        prepared. So when things got hot, they were usually ignored. I was wondering
                        if you got any feel for the spirit of the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know. I didn't really see that, but then I can't compare since
                    ARA was the only bureau I served in the Department. Part of what you describe
                    may really be a reflection of the fairly low priority given to Latin America at
                    the upper levels of the Department. We wait until there is a real flap and then
                    try to apply quick, “magic bullet” solutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Anyway, maybe working with press issues is different. You are not dealing with
                    questions where a person can very often or for very long say, “I just don't want
                    to be bothered with it.” You have to deal with it. And when you deal with other
                    bureaus, especially the other geographic bureaus, they are under the same time
                    pressures. Questions get answereor they don'but they don't wait around very
                    long. What it does mean, thougand there may be something of what you mentioned
                    in thiif a bureau is not in the habit of doing its homework or getting its
                    policy positions nailed down before hand, the press guidance often becomes the
                    policy document. That may not be the best way to make policy, even on minor
                    issues, but I suppose its better than not making it at all.</p>
                <p>Some of what a bureau press officer does in the afternoon is to research policy
                    positions. Maybe you go to a briefing, as I usually did, and straightened out
                    any little misunderstanding that happened to come up, then you spend the rest of
                    the day talking to the press or the people in the bureau who may be working on
                    longer range stories. Or dealing with questions that come from people other than
                    the press. Or dealing with questions from the press that may be anticipated for
                    the next day. Or trying to get a specialized factual answer for somebody.</p>
                <p>Often you would get the question, “What is U.S. policy on X?” X usually meant
                    some kind of an issue that wasn't really on the official front burner. Or maybe
                    a human rights question that might be kind of peculiar or obscure. You grow
                    conscious of the fact there is no golden book of policy someplace where you can
                    go look these things up. Often you would end up going back to the basic texts
                    like some old Biblical or Talmudic scholar. You would look at past press
                    guidance, or past speeches or press conferences by secretaries or assistant
                    secretaries, and so on to try and fathom what the policy was. It must be nice to
                    do that now with computers and advanced search techniques. When I was doing it,
                    it was leafing through guidances, speeches and other documents and racking your
                    brain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine you would have to get away from the easy
                        tendency to make up your policy. But if you did that you could easily
                        deviate from using “the” to “a”, or something like that and you would begin
                        to move away from what it really meant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That is a temptation. If you are dealing with the media, however, it
                    is an easier temptation to avoid because the person asking the question often
                    wanted a quote. When somebody in the media asks you a question, it is not out of
                    idle intellectual curiosity. He has a hole in a story someplace that he is
                    trying to fill. It was customary that bureau press representatives did not want
                    to be quoted themselves. It was considered a discourtesy to the assistant
                    secretary, and a discourtesy to the department spokesman, to have your name go
                    out in front. Later on I'll deal with a situation where that broke down. Even if
                    you sort of knew the answer, you felt you had to get back and get something that
                    somebody had said on the record at some point.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jeff, we are talking about a process. Did you go to each
                        country desk officer to try to get something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Often the procedure would start with the desk officer, although there
                    were multilateral and other issues. I didn't go to the Panama desk for a Panama
                    Canal issue, because that was during the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations. So I
                    would go up to that office one floor above me, and I would talk to somebody up
                    there, including Ambassador Bunker, to get the guidance. The average run of the
                    mill issue would probably start at either the desk officer or the country
                    director level. It depended on personal relationships, who you knew and who you
                    thought could produce quickly. The time pressure was awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were making a quick and dirty judgment about who was
                        going to do it, and those who couldn't produce were out of the loop.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: You had to get around them. The thing about people who can't produce,
                    is they don't mind not being asked to produce. There were some issues where you
                    would go straight to the deputy assistant secretary, and I don't know how to
                    explain how you would sort those out. You would get a feeling for it. Some of
                    the bigger issues you would feel the deputy assistant secretary would be the
                    appropriate place to go, or you would go to the deputy assistant secretary and
                    he or she would bring in the country director (title given to the head of a
                    geographic office within ARA, e.g. Andean affairs, Central America and the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Hodding Carter? How did he use this, and what
                        were his instincts and thrust drives and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think Hodding's instincts were very good. He was bright, had a good
                    sense of humor, and had a good relationship with the press. He did a good job of
                    working himself into the department bureaucracy. There is a dilemma when it
                    comes around to naming a department press spokesman. You can go out and get a
                    media person, which Hodding sort of was, and the press will be flattered and
                    think that is a good thing. They think he will look out for their interests
                    within the department. The trouble is that the department will see him as a
                    journalist and will be very reserved. They won't trust him. On the other hand,
                    you can appoint a good bureaucrat and the department will feel comfortable with
                    him, but the press will be instinctively mistrustful. Both have been done, and
                    both have worked well. But the person involved has to understand that he has
                    homework to do. He has a job to do on the side of the equation from which he did
                    not come. Hodding did that very well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard just yesterday, while interviewing Frances Cook,
                        who had the job you had for African Affairs. She was with USIA, but she was
                        saying that under the present administratioMadeleine Albrighthere is such
                        tight control that the press feels constrained. Everything is controlled so
                        there isn't much access to desk officers and the major networks have stopped
                        sending their correspondents on a permanent basis. What was the feeling when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, on the latter issue, the people who were covering the department
                    at that time were fairly important journalists. We are talking about Bernie
                    Kalb, Ted Koppel, and Bernie Gwertzman and a lot of well known people. Hodding
                    had a good knack for handling guidance in a way that didn't sound “canned,” and
                    a lot of it is knowing how to do that. And some of spokesmanship may have to do
                    with knowing when to do it. When to read it deadpan because you want the press
                    to know it is just standard guidance and you aren't trying to make it more than
                    it is. Then there are times when the slight pause, or the deliberate use of a
                    word other than the one in the guidance, may be exactly the right touch to make
                    it more convincing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you would be talking to the press in the
                        afternoons. How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It would depend on all sorts of issues. If I had an issue where I
                    thought we needed to ghow do I say thinot beyond the guidance, but where
                    additional background maybe was necessary, and I knew who to asked the question
                    in the briefing, I might give them a call and say “Let's talk about it a little
                    more, because there is more background to this you may not have and that I can
                    give you.” Or often, I would be called. Bernie Kalb would call every now and
                    then, and it was always the same conversation. “I don't know anything about
                    Latin America, please tell me about it. Give me an idea of what is going on.” So
                    we would walk it through. Also, journalists would call with a question they
                    planned to bring up in the next morning's briefing. That was almost always a
                    welcome heads up. Occasionally, we would call a journalist and try to plant a
                    question. It is not quite as sneaky as it sounds. In fact that is part of what a
                    good press officer doetrying to engage the interest of journalists in an issue
                    you would like to see get some exposure in the press. Sometimes that would take
                    a considerable conversation. You also spent some time talking to your
                    counterparts in other parts of the department or in other agencies. We all
                    needed to know each other and know that we could make quick contact when an
                    important guidance was involved. The trick was to make sure that your voice is
                    well enough known over the phone so you can get through quickly. I also
                    maintained my ties with USIA because I knew that was probably where my next
                    assignment was coming from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about foreign correspondents?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, we also worked with them. The foreign wire services like
                    Reuters, Agence France Presse, the Spanish EFE and the Italian ANSA were
                    particularly important and were all used by the Latin American media. The major
                    Latin American dailies as well as the big Mexican and Brazilian television
                    networks also had permanent correspondents in Washington. It seemed to me that
                    foreign correspondents were more apt to call my office than the American
                    correspondents, especially if they were new. Many of them did attend the
                    briefings and were treated courteously although they tended to be recognized for
                    questions toward the end of the briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think you, as the ARA representative, would find
                        yourself with a Brazilian correspondent who would want to know a lot about
                        our stand on something that nobody else in the room knew about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's why we got some of those questions where we had to go to old
                    guidances and speeches to try and figure out an answer. As I mentioned the big
                    papers, including the Brazilians, had correspondents in Washington. Estado de
                    Sao Paulo sent my old friend Rui Placido Barbosa to be its Washington
                    correspondent about the time I moved there. Since we knew each other already, it
                    was a nice contact to have. The news magazine Visao as did the Globo television
                    network also had people. I don't remember that the Brazilians were more prone to
                    obscure questions than some of the others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think there would be a problem of being the
                        contact person for people from Latin America, in that the news you would
                        hear in the morning would probably not concern Latin America at all.
                        Whereas, the Middle East and elsewhere, would have their own hemispheric
                        interests so questions could more likely come out of the blue than they
                        would from the standard journalists who were listening to the same
                        broadcasts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I suppose that is true, and that takes me back to another
                    afternoon activity, and that is trying to read as much cable traffic as you
                    could cram into whatever time was left. Sometimes that would keep you until late
                    at night. That was one of the ways you began to anticipate the questions that
                    would come from journalists in various countries. Remember, some of the issues
                    were big and global. For instance the Panama Canal was a big global issue that
                    interested all of Latin America. Human rights issues interested all of Latin
                    America, even when the particular issue was concentrated in Argentina. Other
                    countries in the region were very interested. After all it was the Carter
                    administration with a new policy that was as controversial in Latin America as
                    it was in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Pat Derian had sort of focused on Argentina, and
                        also some parts of Central America, too. Did you find a problem between the
                        ARA line and the human rights line?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, but it was a problem of emphasis. The human rights policy
                    survived into the Reagan administration and we are still making those reports.
                    In some sense, nobody is against human rights. At least nobody wants to say it.
                    But it is a huge question of emphasis and it becomes a kind of transaction by
                    transaction analysis. In this issue, “What am I going to do or where am I going
                    to put the emphasis?” It can get us into real contradictions at times. At some
                    point during the Carter administration, we went to the Argentines and asked them
                    to join us in some boycott of sales or something, but we got turned down cold.
                    They said “You beat up on us everyday on human rights issues. What are you
                    thinking of, coming down here and asking a favor.” I think it was an
                    agricultural boycott of some kind. Agricultural products, I think, and the
                    Argentines make as much money out of that as we do. It is a big deal for them
                    and they just said flat “no!” There really is a big contradiction in publicly
                    flogging people up, calling into question the civilized values of their whole
                    culture on the one hand and then asking them to do you a favor that is certainly
                    not in their economic interest.</p>
                <p>To go back to your question, in the first place, there is sort of an old
                    fashioned instinct to protect at least some of the image of the country or
                    region in which you served or will serve. Also, there is, I think, a kind of
                    State Department instinct to follow the dictates of American policy written
                    rather small. We tend to define our political, military and trade interests in
                    rather short term, cash on the barrel head terms. That is the safer, down to
                    earth approach that helps to mitigate the striped pants, cookie pushing image
                    Americans impose on diplomacy. That tendency tended to come to the fore in the
                    ARA Bureau, especially with Terry Todman, who is a conservative, traditional
                    diplomat in many ways. I think he shares with a lot of folks, including myself,
                    a great deal of pessimism about how much human rights behavior was going to be
                    really improved in Latin America by us publicly trumpeting our disapproval. What
                    I think is a very sound diplomatic instinct says you ought to deal with it
                    privately before you deal with it publicly. That conflicted with the feeling of
                    Assistant Secretary for Human Rights Pat Derian's bureathat dealing with it
                    privately doesn't really do the job. You get polite treatment, but the people
                    that are being mistreated don't get any better treatment. So it was a chore
                    clearing those guidance(end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying it worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: And it worked because both sides were willing to compromise. Part of
                    compromise, too, often in that kind of situation, is not dealing with the
                    assistant secretary directly at the beginning. You figure out who at the deputy
                    assistant secretary level has a bit more time to do it. In my case, Mark
                    Schneider, who was the principal deputy assistant secretary at that time, was a
                    good and reasonable negotiator who understood the value of softening the
                    rhetoric every now and then in order to get the main message through. On the
                    other side, ARA wasn't always necessarily opposed to the main message as long as
                    it was stated courteously.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find as you were dealing with this, that there was a basic problem in
                    the area where you were, because at this point it was getting ready to change
                    rather quickly, but hadn't yet? The majority of the governments in ARA were run
                    by military dictatorships. This must have caused a certain amount of disquiet
                    and disdain within the system didn't it?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't think that professionals working in the Latin American area
                    felt disdain for the people running most of the countries they dealt with, nor
                    did the people working in the Middle East Bureau feel disdain for the people
                    they dealt with. There were of course some exceptions, especially in Central
                    America. Disdain is something you feel when you don't know somebody. When you do
                    know them, you begin to see subtleties and nuances and the possibility of
                    improvement. Virtually all the countries of Latin American area still call
                    themselves “republics” and they all pay a certain sort of lip service to
                    democracy. “Well, we are not ready yet, but we're going to go there.”</p>
                <p>If I have one political secret to reveal out of this, and one piece of advice to
                    anybody, it is this: Be very careful of your cover story, because it is probably
                    going to become true. For example, U.S. policy in Central America during the
                    Reagan period. It was pure anti communism in the old style during the first
                    Reagan administration. Support for democracy was the cover story. When you get
                    to the second part of the Reagan administration and the Bush administration, it
                    really was a program of promoting democracy in those countries, often at the
                    expense of some of our old fashioned strategic interests. If you are dealing
                    with clever people on the other side, they will make you continually repeat the
                    story, then count on the press and your own people, and all sorts of other folks
                    to beat you into actually doing it. Be careful of your cover story.</p>
                <p>The corollary of that is that when somebody is saying things you like, even when
                    you know they aren't true, it is not in your interest to say, “Why, you
                    hypocrite, you don't believe that and I don't believe you and you should quit
                    saying it.” The wiser tactic is to say, “What was that you said?” Make them keep
                    saying it. The insistence of Latin Americans of always paying lip service to
                    democracy had a lot to do with finally making them democratic. Their own
                    citizens kept saying, “Hey, where is this democracy you've been talking about?
                    Lets try some of that.” You could develop disdain for Somoza, partly because he
                    was cruel, but also because he was stupid. The thing about military
                    dictatorships is they tend to get more stupid. We talk about military strong men
                    but the fact is that military dictatorships are very rarely strong, and
                    especially when it comes to any kind of innovation. They don't have parliaments,
                    assemblies, and a free press. They have no mechanism to test their ideas. What
                    they are always worried about are the persons behind them who want their job.
                    This tends to make them conservative and they don't try anything new.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I don't think many of us ever felt like dealing contemptuously with the
                    governments we had to deal with. That is not a creative or professional way to
                    behave. Latin Americans are nice folks who speak a language that is easy for us
                    to learn. They are part of a culture that is well represented here in the U.S.
                    That makes us think we can deal with them on a basis of some shared values.</p>
                <p>I think that drove a lot of the human rights people nuts in a way. In a way they
                    wanted us, in some ways, to treat them with contempt. We really do share some
                    things in common with Latin America. Part of it is a sort of frontier tradition.
                    We are all “new world” folks and there are certain values that flow from the
                    immigrant/pioneer experience that are common to Anglo and Latin Americans. Latin
                    Americans would often complain during that human rights period, “Why do you beat
                    up on us so much more on human rights than you do other countries?” The official
                    answer was, “We are an equal opportunity bully. We beat up on everybody.” The
                    fact is, we did beat up on Latin America in some ways harder and I think some of
                    it has to do with a certain amount of racism and prejudice on our own part. You
                    know the old clich?s: “Human life is cheap in Asia and Africans are hopelessly
                    underdeveloped. You can't expect much from them.” At the same time we believed
                    we ought to expect more from those Catholic Christian, European language
                    speaking Latin Americans. They ought to know better, those countries that call
                    themselves republics, where towns have the same names as some towns in this
                    country and people go to church on Sunday. In short, we thought Latin Americans
                    ought to know better; we weren't so sure about Asia and Africa.</p>
                <p>I often tried that explanation with Latin Americans journalists, because I could
                    end the conversation with “would you want it any differently?” We were basically
                    saying to them “Yes, we beat up on you more because we expect more from you.
                    Should we expect less?” And the answer was usually “no.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I won't remember them all. The basic overriding issue was the steady
                    deterioration of authoritarian regimes, the beginnings of a transition toward
                    democracy. The situation was already pretty bad in Central America. Somoza fell
                    and the Sandinistas took over in Nicaragua. El Salvador was becoming more and
                    more repressive. Panama was trying, not always successfully, to behave well
                    because of pending ratification of the canal treaty. You had a deteriorating
                    human rights situation in Argentina and Chile. We had just opened the U.S.
                    Interests Section in Havana, which meant we had to contend with considerable
                    hostility from the Cuban exiles in Florida and New Jersey and considerable
                    opposition in the Senate. Mexico and our common border always require attention,
                    and we were not helped by President Carter's famous “Montezuma's revenge”
                    gaffe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Mexico is different. Not only because it borders the United States.
                    I'm trying to remember which issues engaged us more and it was probably the
                    paraquet issue. Paraquet was a herbicide and we were helping the Mexicans get it
                    and urging them to spray marijuana crops in Mexico. There was concern that the
                    leaves that had been sprayed with paraquet would be processed and sold in the
                    United States, and because they were contaminated with paraquet they were
                    dangerous to the health of marijuana smokers in the United States. The U.S. and
                    Mexican governments were taking a lot of damage in the press and the Mexicans
                    were saying, “You persons asked us to do that. All it gets us is problems. Can't
                    you do something to make your press stop beating up on us?”</p>
                <p>Brazil is was another big issue country where, instead of dealing with the fate
                    of a nation, you are dealing with a bunch of practical problems that have to do
                    with two countries working together. We were very concerned about issues of
                    nuclear proliferation and the reprocessing of uranium in Brazil at that time.
                    Also, we were watching a military dictatorship that was running out of steam and
                    you knew a transition had to come and as much as you welcome transitions, you
                    have to know when you look at a place like Nicaragua how dangerous they can be.
                    You try to imagine something as awful as what was happening in Nicaragua
                    happening on a large scale in a country like Argentina and Brazil, and you are
                    talking about a very serious problem.</p>
                <p>There were also small bore Latin American issues, which don't keep anyway up at
                    night, but need to be handled with some carArgentina and Chile's squabble over
                    the Beagle Channel islands, Bolivia's claims to access to the Pacific, Ecuador's
                    border dispute with Peru, not to mention the hardy perennials like Haiti's
                    poverty and the desire of Cubans to get the hell out of Cuba. There were also
                    single country issues that didn't even get mentioned in the U.S. press, but
                    could raise hell in a particular country. For example, the U.S. has a strategic
                    reserve of tin it collected during the second world war. Every now and then
                    somebody in GSA (the U.S. General Services Administration) decides the reserve
                    is too big and we need to sell some of it. When we do that world tin prices are
                    depressed and Bolivia takes the loss. In La Paz, its a serious issue and rightly
                    so. It does seem kind of ironic that we would do that to a country that was a
                    major recipient of U.S. AID funds.</p>
                <p>We had a horrible situation in Chile which was in a way symbolized by the
                    Letelier Moffat case, which of course involved, not only our concerns about
                    where Chile was going, but some very solid American interests about what kind of
                    crimes can be committed in our nation's capital.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I guess it's Sheridan. It is the first circle after Dupont Circle
                    on Massachusetts Avenue. Orlando Letelier and his assistant Ronnie Moffat were
                    killed practically in front of the Chilean Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A car bomb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, a bomb killed them in their car. During my time in ARA our basic
                    goal was to get the Chileans to cough up the perpetrators. We wanted them here
                    in the United States to answer for a murder committed in the United States.
                    Chile of course wanted to hold us off by saying they would take care of it all
                    in Chile without of course doing anything. That line played pretty well in Chile
                    by wrapping it in the flag as a question of national sovereignty. The Chilean
                    government was of course protecting the perpetrators for obvious reasons. I
                    don't remember this as a particularly hard issue to handle in terms of
                    generating press guidance. Our position was pretty clear and, leaving aside the
                    fact that it wasn't working, nobody in the State Department or the Department of
                    Justice had any particular quarrel with what we were saying.</p>
                <p>I remember another murder as being much more difficult to handle. That was the
                    Horman case. Charles Horman was a young man who was in Chile as a freelance
                    writer, and was killed in the anti Allende coup. It became a movie - Costa
                    Gavras' Missing - with Jack Lemon playing Charles Horman's father. Charles
                    Horman's father was well known throughout the bureau. He and Horman's widow are
                    still trying to find out what happened to his son. It's a heartbreaking thing to
                    be with a father who has lost a son, but there weren't any good definitive
                    answers to this as to how and why. There were a lot of journalistic versions
                    flying around about trips to Valparaiso, secret naval installations, CIA
                    involvement, and all sorts of other stuff that was not particularly convincing.
                    Most of it came from people intent on demonizing Pinochet or the CIA or both. I
                    don't have any particular objection to demonizing Pinochet, but the stuff just
                    wasn't very convincing and tended to make poor young Horman look more important
                    than he really was.</p>
                <p>We knew pretty well how he was killed in a stadium where prisoners were being
                    held, but we really don't know very much about why he was killed. That's sad,
                    because families want to know. I guess that's what we have come to call closure.
                    Families also want to believe that a loved one died for some reason, preferably
                    some noble cause. All of us prefer heroes to mere victims. Almost all the
                    versions that still circulate maintain Horman was killed because he had
                    uncovered some dark truth about Pinochet or U.S. involvement. Well the truth
                    about Pinochet was pretty dark and everybody knew it. Stories of U.S.
                    involvement still suffer from chronic exaggeration. The family's understandable
                    desire to believe Charles died for a greater cause played into the political
                    agenda of people out to get Pinochet or the CIA, or both.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>In a sense we all want to give some meaningful significance to the loss of a
                    young man. I notice that now when the story shows up in the press Charles Horman
                    is referred to as a journalist. That is something of a promotion. I don't
                    remember anybody calling him a journalist at the time I'm talking about.. He was
                    a young man like many others, excited by seventies politics and Salvador
                    Allende's Chile, who wanted a role. I suppose he was indeed trying to establish
                    himself as a freelance writer. Nothing wrong with that except that he was living
                    in an extremely dangerous environment. Unfortunately, even in the most dramatic
                    circumstances people still die for banal reasons - a wrong word, a fit of nerves
                    or bad temper, or just plain human cruelty. Somebody says the wrong thing and
                    somebody else pulls the trigger. Somebody doesn't like foreigners assuming a
                    role in a national drama or just doesn't like Americans. I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cuba, did the Mariel thing happen on your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it did in 1980. Cuban issues are really hard. Well, the first big
                    thing that happened in our relations with Cuba was the opening of the Interests
                    Section. The Carter administration were the ones that took the first step toward
                    the beginning of a restoration of relations with Cuba. The coordinator for Cuban
                    affairs had the office next door to mine. That was Wayne Smith, who was an old
                    friend from the embassy in Argentina. You quickly learned to be very wary of the
                    Cuban American National Foundation because they thought the opening of an
                    Interests Section was a terrible idea and they were afraid it might lead exactly
                    where the Carter administration wanted it to go. That led to the Cuban American
                    National Foundation (CANF) getting together with a lot of other like minded
                    folks and to the establishment of radio of Radio Marti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not during my time in ARA. It took a while for the CANF and its allies
                    to bring it off. Radio Marti was finally authorized by President Reagan through
                    an executive order in 1983 and began broadcasting in May of 1985. But Radio
                    Marti was a very interesting phenomenon because its motivations were, to my
                    mind, mischievous. I think the tactic of the Cuba lobby when dealing with a new
                    administrations of either party is basically this: It gathers its forces to
                    engineer a hostile legislative or administrative act, an action of considerable
                    hostility, that would make an administration look silly if it were to begin some
                    kind of positive engagement with Cuba. It is a way of getting a new
                    administration to commit itself to a continuation of the embargo and the general
                    isolation oCuba. Radio Marti was the first act of hostile legislation. The
                    second one during the Bush administration was TV Marti. And for the Clinton
                    administration it was the Helms Burton Act. They were all done for the same
                    purpose - to set the tone, to commit an administration to a strong anti Castro
                    stand.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The effect of the three acts in Cuba was quite different. Radio Marti turned out
                    to be pretty good, at least for a while. I visited Cuba - in 1988 I think - when
                    I was USIA's Latin America area director. I remember meeting with two young
                    journalists from Prensa Latina, the Cuban wire service, who told me that because
                    of Radio Marti they had a much freer hand than before in reporting the news. TV
                    Marti, on the other hand, was a joke. I'm no technician, but there is a big
                    difference between radio and TV signals - radio signals can sort of be muscled
                    through with transmitter power, but TV signals are complicated and delicate. We
                    simply could not get a watchable signal through to Cuba. We even tried
                    transmitting from tethered balloons in the Florida keys. We called them
                    “aerostats” so it wouldn't sound as silly as it really was. To understand how
                    Helms Burton has really worked, you have to go back forty years to the original
                    embargo. The embargo was based partially on the notion that if the U.S. didn't
                    do something, or sell or provide something, nobody else would either. That is of
                    course nonsense. Helms Burton was an attempt to enforce Cuba's isolation by
                    sanctioning other nations who did business with Cuba. All it has done is annoy
                    our allies and, so far as Cuba policy is concerned, isolate the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Well, I've gotten way ahead of myself, but that's the way the Cuban American
                    National Foundation has worked in the past. Whether they will continue in the
                    same way is hard to tell. With the passing of Jorge Mas Canosa, the Foundation
                    doesn't seem to be quite what it used to be.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Again, clearing a press guidance on any Cuban issue was a very
                    delicate matter.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, and everybody knew where Wayne's sympathies were, but he was a
                    smart enough operator to know it was not good to get up and get the assistant
                    secretary and Hodding Carter in a heap of trouble by saying something stupid. So
                    we were very careful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you all able to identify any members of the press

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh yes, but not very many. There was a person named Les Kinsolving,
                    who was with a group called Accuracy in Media, which was basically a right wing
                    organization that pretended to be very interested in the media, and who liked to
                    badger Hodding with all sorts of silly questions during the briefing. But he
                    didn't pay much attention to Latin America. There were a couple of others, but
                    we didn't have much of that. There was the person from Vision magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vision came out of where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I'm trying to remember. I think by that time it was being published
                    out of Miami, but I'm not sure. It was a good Spanish language Time clone. now
                    which country it came from at that time. Their correspondent liked to trip up a
                    spokesman every now and then, either me or Hodding. But provocative questions
                    are not designed so much to cause trouble as provoke an interesting quote to
                    fill a hole, or at least dull spot, in a story.</p>
                <p>I found most journalists to be pretty serious persons who were trying to do a
                    job. They liked to get into print. Remember, often among the Americans, these
                    were State Department correspondents, not regional correspondents. The regional
                    persons, of course, wanted the stories to go in their papers. They would ask me
                    to dig out a quote from some place and it would be published in some paper in
                    Quito or wherever, and I wouldn't know about it. Somebody would send me a
                    clipping about it later. Another thing that would happen to me in the afternoon
                    would be PAOs and political counselors and people from embassies calling me and
                    saying, “What the hell did you say about my country today?” I tried like hell to
                    get the bureau to authorize us to at least send press guidances out as cables. I
                    could never bring it off.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: People would say, “No, those are for our use, and we don't know if
                    they will use them the right way if you send them out there. And what if they
                    are not used?” All these arguments were nonsense. Eventually, of course, the
                    Department finally started sending them, but well after my time. Now it doesn't
                    make any difference because anybody in the world who wants to watch the State
                    Department briefing can do so. If you are in an embassy now, the problem is
                    finding the time to do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, let's hear it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That was in the Jonestown, Guyana thing, which was a big story. Well,
                    all right, we can get into Jonestown. I remember it better than anything else I
                    did, because it was the biggest, most awful thing that happened on that job.</p>
                <p>Q: I have a long interview with Richard Dyer, who was the DCM and who was
                    wounderight in the butt. He is now dead. It's here.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I remember that. I would love to see it sometime. Well, to put it into
                    context, I had been out sailing and had a great day on the Potomac. I used to
                    keep a boat at the Gangplank Marina. I had come back tired, taken a shower, and
                    was getting ready to have supper, I guess. I got a call saying, “We think a
                    congressman has been shot in Guyana. We don't have many details, but you better
                    come in.” After making a few other calls, I decided I had better call Tom
                    Reston. Tom was Hodding's deputy. His father answered the phone, James Reston of
                    the New York Times, and he said Tom wasn't there and could he take a message. I
                    gave my name, then he asked if he could tell Tom what it was about. I said “No,
                    I'd better talk to him.” And he said, “Oh, yes, of course. I shouldn't have
                    asked.” Of course I could have told him but I didn't know what I was dealing
                    with at that time, and he was a journalist.</p>
                <p>I got to the department as quick as I could after making that call. Brandon Grove
                    was there, he was the deputy assistant secretary responsible for Guyana matters
                    at that time. Also Dick McCoy, a fine consular officer, who became a deputy
                    assistant secretary in the consular bureau. It was essentially the three of us
                    that first night as we kept getting bits of information about this unfolding
                    tragedy. We were trying to figure out what we were going to do about it the next
                    morning, when the department began to come to life. Information was coming in
                    pretty slowly. We knew pretty much who had been killed and we knew what had
                    happened to the party and where they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the congressional party.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: We're talking about a congressional delegation, Congressman Leo Ryan,
                    the aides, journalists, and embassy people who were with him. They had gone and
                    visited, spent time with people looking into the question of whether people were
                    being held against their will at Jonestown. Upon their departure, as they were
                    loading the airplane to fly back to Georgetown, they were attacked, shot at, and
                    some were killed. We were playing a lot of “catch up ball” at that time. We
                    hadn't spent a lot of time thinking about Jonestown, Guyana. I had heard about
                    it a little bit, Dick McCoy knew a lot about it because he had been there. He
                    was our main resource on this. Brandon of course had a lot of other countries on
                    his plate. A lot of what we were doing that night was getting reports in,
                    various phone conversations, cables, or whatever. And, through Dick, trying to
                    interpret them. I don't know how it came up, but the possibility of suicide came
                    up that night. I said “No, that is just too much.” Dick McCoy said, “What about
                    Masada?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Jewish revolt during the Roman
                        times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was not inconceivable, was what Dick was saying. It was
                    conceivable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first of these mass suicides in modern times.
                        There have been several since, but not on this scale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, not anywhere near this scale. Nothing has approached that. We were
                    dealing with an issue that was getting worse and worse. The next morning we had
                    to face the question of what to do about the briefing. I can't remember how this
                    worked. This may have been on the first morning after the killings, or on the
                    second morning. But at some point we realized that the situation was eroding
                    very quickly, and that we were going to have a an avalanche of press interest
                    and that we weren't going to be able to use the traditional methods of preparing
                    the spokesman. At some point we decided we had better put on somebody from the
                    bureau. John Bushnell, the principal deputy assistant secretary for ARA,
                    introduced by Hodding, began to brief on the Jonestown issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>It was a strange issue because there wasn't much classified information to be
                    protected. We were of course interested in protecting the Department's
                    reputation, in terms of how we had handled the whole problem of the Jonestown
                    settlement. That is not an issue to which classification applies and you better
                    not try to do it that way. It is one thing to make a cable L O U (Limited
                    Official Use) when you are washing a little bit of dirty linen, but you can't do
                    it on a major story like Jonestown. It came down to the fact that we could put
                    out any information we had, when we had it, as long as we put some caveats on it
                    that it was preliminary and as long as we were pretty convinced it was true. The
                    other set of constraints we dealt with had to do with the consular rules
                    regarding the death of American citizens overseas and our desire that families
                    should be informed before their names of the victims appear in the press. Other
                    than that, we were dealing openly with the press.</p>
                <p>However, there were Jonestown people in Georgetown who became very active in
                    putting out stuff to the press that wasn't true. One series of stories they
                    tried to sell were about Dick McCoy. Dick had visited Jonestown as a consular
                    officer of the U.S. embassy, and he was one of the few people, maybe the only
                    one, who had a memo on record saying, “There is something wrong out there.” I
                    had a feeling that the rest of the embassy really didn't want to get involved in
                    Jonestown. I think they were telling themselves, “This is a religious group, and
                    we are just going to get nothing but a heap of trouble. The government of Guyana
                    says these people can be here, and they are religious folk, and we don't want to
                    mess with them. But Dick had a memo he had written to the ambassador saying
                    something was not right, Jonestown wasn't what it appeared to be and that people
                    were perhaps being held against their will.</p>
                <p>The Jonestown staffers in Georgetown who had manned a sort of liaison office for
                    the community of course wanted to show that everything was just fine and that
                    Jonestown had been somehow victimized. They began to circulate rumors that Dick
                    had an affair with one of their members. They obviously didn't know Dick
                    McCoy.</p>
                <p>Q: There is an interview with Dick .</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, good, good. We decided to go proactive and thought our best
                    resource on this was Dick himself. He just looks so good, and comes across so
                    sincere and down to earth. So, I arranged an interview with Ted Koppel. Koppel
                    is a fine, no ax to grind journalist and Dick came across as the serious
                    dedicated professional he really is. The interview worked just fine. It was a
                    minor triumph on the media front. I was really touched months later to find that
                    Dick had written a letter to State Magazine, thanking Kate Marshall and me for
                    the support we gave him during that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Within a day or to after the event, we had to go to a task force configuration up
                    in the Op Center. Meanwhile, the story was just about out of all control.
                    Journalists from newspapers all over the world and the United States were
                    calling the State Department for information but there was so little information
                    for us to offer. We laid on extra press people to handle the inquiries. I was in
                    charge of the press operation, but mainly it was a matter of keeping people on
                    the phones handling as many inquiries as possible and, of course, making sure
                    that the people taking the calls had the latest available information.</p>
                <p>There were already journalists in Georgetown, but there was a big problem in
                    getting them to Jonestown. There was no overland route to go there and virtually
                    no planes available. The poor embassy had something close to a press riot on
                    their hands. There is nothing more testy than a journalist sitting in a bad
                    hotel unable to get to a story he or she's been assigned to cover. Pretty soon
                    the less experienced - and you get those when smaller papers start sending
                    people overseas - begin to interview innocent, and uninformed, bystanders and,
                    worse yet, each other. That is a perfect formula for spreading rumors and rank
                    speculation. The lone USIS Public Affairs Officer had probably never had more
                    than one journalist at a time in Georgetown and even that infrequently. There
                    was no way he and his small staff could help dozens of reporters covering a
                    worldwide, front page storFortunately, USIA agreed to send some experienced
                    press people down to help. We, of course by then had some air assets in place,
                    mainly of course to get our own consular and other people in and out, but were
                    also able to accommodate some of the journalists. The USIS and USIA people did a
                    good job of organizing transportation and keeping those the couldn't get
                    transport as well briefed as possible.</p>
                <p>And now we are coming back to your original question, which was “where did we
                    start to break the rules on attributing things to ourselves?” These are rules
                    that have been bent before in special circumstances. I remember we were sitting
                    in this big room, and by that time there were probably six or seven other press
                    types working for me, and we were taking calls as fast as we could. I got a call
                    from somebody in Iowa or Missouri or Alabama, I don't remember, but I answered
                    his questions and he said, “And what's your name so I can quote you and spell it
                    right.” I said “I prefer that you not use my name.” He said, “I'VE SPENT ALL DAY
                    ON THIS TELEPHONE TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO YOU PERSONS AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL
                    ME I CAN'T USE YOUR NAME?” So I said all right, he could use my name. At that
                    point we all started using our names because we were dealing with papers that
                    neither knew those conventions nor thought they were very serious, and who could
                    not see any reason why they couldn't use the name of the person they talked to.
                    They were right about that. As far as I know, no one in the Department ever
                    complained.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The two worst issues we had to deal with both involved numbers. The one that
                    played mainly in the Department's press briefing was how much the whole rescue
                    and mortuary operation was costing the U.S. taxpayer. That's a good example of
                    an easy to ask, hard to answer question. The fact is we couldn't really come up
                    with a good answer very quickly. I'm not sure we ever did. It involved the
                    budgets of too many department's and agencies. Virtually every organization that
                    ever had a role in foreign affairs was involved, with major chunks of Department
                    and Pentagon money going into the hopper. But, the press in the briefing kept
                    asking for the number and when we were going to get it. The situation was not
                    helped when one Department official, in a monumental flight of insensitivity,
                    asked the press to remember the intangible training benefits that were accruing
                    to the U.S. Army by picking up more than nine hundred decaying corpses and
                    shipping them to Delaware.</p>
                <p>The other numbers issue was of course the number of dead. They just kept growing.
                    From the first over flights, they thought there were two or three hundred people
                    at the most because they were looking from the air.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was talk about “they must be out in the bushes
                        hiding.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, all sorts of things. Actually there were a few people out hiding
                    in the bush. But what we really didn't know early on was that there bodies piled
                    on top of bodies. To finally get a count, you had to go in and move bodies. A
                    horrifying job. I think some people in the press were a little suspicious of how
                    the numbers kept growing. They may have thought that somehow we were trying to
                    minimize the disaster by holding back the full count from them, and then getting
                    beaten into revealing what an awful tragedy it had been. It is that amateurish,
                    post Watergate assumption that somehow the government must just be lying to you
                    no matter what. Other, wiser, journalists figured out that we had no particular
                    reason to minimize the disaster. They understand the real story was the human
                    tragedy and the awful job the government had of caring for the bodies and
                    dealing with bereaved and suspicious relatives.</p>
                <p>Sometimes we had to deal with journalists who were simply mad because the figure
                    they had presented as right and final simply wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having any problems with the Jonestown office in
                        San Francisco? They were trying to defend the church and the Reverend

                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I remember the Jonestown office in Georgetown being more of a problem
                    to us. I don't think the San Francisco office was very effective in trying to
                    defend him. Where I ran into trouble in San Francisco was with one of the San
                    Francisco papers. This was after the crisis, probably after Thanksgiving. I
                    don't remember the exact date it started, but it was November and a list of the
                    dead had surfaced. I don't remember now where the list came from, but it was
                    pretty good. One of the San Francisco papers had it and they were going to
                    publish it. It was my job to try to talk them out of it, based on the fact that
                    we hadn't had time to inform the next of kin. I think I got accused of harassing
                    and threatening the newspaper. We felt that families should not find out about
                    the death of a loved one by reading it in the paper or hearing it broadcast. The
                    paper felt it was a public service to publish the list because there were people
                    living in a state of uncertainty and the kindest public thing to do was to let
                    people know what had really happened and what the truth was. You always
                    wondecould we have done a better job? Could the department have moved more
                    quickly? But that is hindsight stuff.</p>

                        I'm very dubious. You are talking about a religious organization. What would

                        with the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, and they ended up essentially
                        killing themselves.</hi>

                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I don't know what you do about it. There were people being
                    coerced into staying there, but they were being coerced by psychological methods
                    that are hard to sort out from religious practice.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: I was talking to a friend not too long ago who happened to stumble

                    were standing them up, pretending to talk in tongues, and yelling at them about
                    how dirty and foul they were if they weren't saved. He referred to it as child
                    abuse. He has a point. But I don't know what we would have done either. We would
                    have had to deal with the government of Guyana and what on earth would we have
                    been able to do?</p>

                <p>Did we unwittingly finger Charles Horman in his case? Did somebody pass a list,
                    at some point, to the Chilean government that said “These are people you really
                    ought to look at, they are leftist types?” This could have been done, in the
                    spirit of the cold war liaison by somebody that really would have been horrified
                    by the idea that he was producing a hit list. He was just saying these are folks
                    you should watch out about. I don't know that is what happened, but there was
                    suspicion that it could have happened haunted us all through that case.</p>

                        Even though Jim Jones and his followers did this to themselves, it had to be
                        our fault. In later testimony, it came out that Dick McCoy and others
                        discovered they got pretty lonely after awhile, because the ARA was not
                        sending their top people out to back them up. Did you get any feeling of

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was gone by then, so I don't know much about any follow up on it. If
                    that is the case, that is unfortunate because Dick was the major asset. If your
                    job was to say, “Hey, the U.S. government and the U.S. embassy in Georgetown did
                    what it could,” Dick was our major asset. What would have been better, of
                    course, if there had a memo or cable from the ambassador to Washington saying
                    something was wrong, or if there had been a memorandum of conversation with the
                    foreign minister of Guyana saying something was wrong.</p>

                    knows, it might have changed some things. There might have been more caution,
                    had you felt something was really wrong, maybe Ryan could have been prevailed on
                    to not go, or to structure his visit in a different way.</p>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Who the hell would think that more than 900 people would kill
                    themselves. And of course people tend to make the government the fall person,
                    especially in a country like the United States. It is like asking the Latin
                    Americans if they really mind being held to a higher standard. The U.S.
                    government gets held to the highest standard because it is supposed to be a
                    competent government that can keep people from getting killed. We believe in a
                    free enterprise economy, but we sure as hell believe the government better
                    intervene to keep us from entering into economic disasters. Again, I'm not sure
                    I would want to live in a country where people didn't hold the government
                    responsible when people died.</p>
                <p>Q: Jeff, one last thing on this particular phasthe Panama Canal, how did that go?
                    That was a very hot issue.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That was a hot one, and I'm not as good on that issue because I was
                    new when it was happening. The treaty was signed in September of 1977 just about
                    the time I was arriving in ARA. Consequently, we had a lot of press guidance
                    around that was still pretty good. I didn't have to craft things to say why the
                    Panama Canal Treaty was a good idea. It was more a matter of recasting things we
                    had said before and getting them cleared by Ambassador Bunker's people. Richard
                    Wyrough was Bunker's number two and he always knew what to say. Our main
                    concern, of course, was ratification. We eventually got that in April of 1978. A
                    lot of the action tended to be more in Congressional Liaison than it was in ARA
                    at that time. I know my own personal feelings and the feelings of the bureau
                    were that the treaty was a damn good idea, because it removed a needless
                    irritant in U.S. Latin American relations. One of those automatic irritants that
                    could be used to our detriment in almost any situation. No matter what we tried
                    to do in Latin America, those who did not wish you well could pick up the big
                    stick that Teddy Roosevelt created and beat us with it. Again, there was no need
                    to keep it. Commerce was going to flow anyway. We knew the military bases, as
                    convenient as they were and as pleasant as they were, could be moved
                    elsewhere.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 14th of December, 1999. You had never served in the Middle East, had
                    you? What baggage did you take with you when you went to Israel?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, I took with me the baggage that most middle class Americans, and
                    especially those with a Protestant upbringing, all took to the question of
                    Israel. You go back to the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948, I can
                    remember it, and I think I mentioned once before how peculiar I thought it was
                    when one of my close friends at that time was telling me how he wanted to go
                    fight for Israel. That had made an impression on me. Although it is popular now
                    to talk now about how Evangelical Protestants feel a certain attraction to
                    Israel, the fact is probably all American Protestants feel that attraction or
                    carry some basically positive psychological imprints in their mind toward
                    Israel. Especially those who went to church. Protestant pastors, including my
                    father, tend to preach as much or more out of the Old Testament as they do out
                    of the New. I think the stories are better. I probably went to Israel with a
                    positive balance toward the State of Israel but not much of a tendency to
                    question the legitimacy of the State of Israel, nor much of a tendency to dwell
                    much on the plight of the Palestinians. I think that was where I stood when I
                    got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1979, when you arrived there, what were your
                        impressions of Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Pretty positive. I saw Tel Aviv as a nice, Mediterranean style city
                    and saw right away it was a place where I was going to enjoy living. I was
                    certainly looking forward to the job. It was a great job for a someone who had
                    spent quite a bit of time involved with day to day press operations. That is an
                    important distinction within a USIA context, because a lot of what USIA does is
                    long term stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you explain the difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: USIA did a lot of stuff that had to do with the future of U.S. foreign
                    policy, and I hope that continues under the present circumstances. USIA was very
                    interested in long term information about the United States, explaining U.S.
                    culture, explaining the U.S. political system. All that goes back to educational
                    exchange programs and other things. I consider it as almost the preventive
                    maintenance of foreign policy. You've got to do that well to keep the machinery
                    that runs day to day diplomacy working. I feel that as strongly now as I did
                    then. But that did mean that a lot of USIA officers did not have experience in
                    dealing with day to day press operationanswering those questions that come up
                    from journalists every day. I was fortunate enough to have had a big dose of
                    that in my State Department assignment and because of that assignment, I was
                    suggested for the job in Tel Aviv. I know that Sam Lewis had done some
                    investigation and looked around for somebody that was serving in one of the
                    press positions in State. He was probably wise to do so. That was good, because
                    the Ambassador was positively disposed towards me before I got there, because he
                    had made the choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the press officer fit in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, that's a good question. In some big embassies press or
                    information officers sometimes had a problematic relationship in that if a PAO,
                    the senior officer, the person in charge of all of USIS, wanted to maintain an
                    exclusive personal relationship with the ambassador, if he wanted you to go
                    through him to the ambassador, it probably wasn't going to work very well. I was
                    fortunate when I got there because David Hitchcock, the PAO, was wise enough to
                    see right away that the advisability of a direct, day to day relationship
                    between the press attach? and the Ambassador. Although he kept his hand in, in
                    terms of giving advice and long term goals, he was quite content to see direct
                    relationship between the ambassador and me. One of the first meetings we had,
                    where David Hitchcock and I went to see Sam Lewis, he asked me what I needed to
                    make it work well. He indicated he hadn't been entirely happy with past press
                    relations. I said I needed a daily meeting. We discussed it and finally agreed
                    on the middle of the morning. This gave me time to get into the office and
                    figure out what questions we ought to deal with. That became institutionalized,
                    and the PAO usually joined me in those meetings, but if he couldn't, I went by
                    myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the daily meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Because in Israel there were questions that would involve the press
                    every day. It was really hard there because I didn't have any Hebrew, although
                    the original plan was for me to leave State and take Hebrew for a year, then go
                    to Israel. My predecessor's wife got very ill and he had to be pulled, so I got
                    called and told I had to be ready to go in a few weeks rather than a year.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>To know what was going on in the Israeli press, we had to wait for a national
                    employee to prepare the media reaction cable for Washington. We had a person who
                    was very good and could get it done by midmorning before the meeting. Hitchcock
                    and I could then go through that cable and figure out what the likely questions
                    were. And decide what we wanted to say, both in terms of any press encounter Sam
                    Lewis might have during the day, and to offer whatever advice we could to
                    Washington as they were preparing guidance for the spokesmen. We did both those
                    things.</p>
                <p>Whenever the ambassador would have a meeting any place on a senior level in
                    Jerusalem (and that was often) he would be seen by the press, and the press
                    would try to ask him questions. The easy way would have been to suggest that he
                    say, “I don't answer questions.” But that is also the dumb answer. If you are
                    good, you can do yourself some good by how you answer those questions. Sam Lewis
                    often did, he was good with the press, had good memory, and kept things in line.
                    He also was very open to the press. We usually accepted requests for
                    appointments from journalists. I would usually sit in, and he made good use of
                    those, both in terms of getting the U.S. governments point of view across to the
                    journalist and getting the journalist to share information and opinions with
                    him. About three quarters of the way through the interview he would say “All
                    right, you've had your turn, now I get my turn” and talking to them for their
                    perceptions as to what was going on. There was a lesson to be learned from that.
                    Done properly, our relationship with the press in diplomacy is a two way street.
                    In many ways they share some aspects of our business. They are often good at it.
                    While they have their professional imperatives that can impede objectivity, so
                    do we.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will go through the major events during this time, but
                        first let's talk about overall impressions. What was your impression of the
                        Israeli media?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They are real good. Before I do that, I have to lay out more of what
                    the situation was, because in a way it is a very peculiar place, and especially
                    in traditional USIS terms. I hadn't been there two days before somebody said “We
                    all have to get in the car and go up to Jerusalem because Bob Strauss is coming
                    in for the first of a series of talks.” These were of course part of the follow
                    up to the Camp David agreements. You asked before about the baggage I took with
                    me to Israel. Part of it was my impression of the Camp David agreements. While I
                    was still at State but knew I was going to Israel, I watched the White House
                    signing ceremony on television. I remember thinking “Wow, this is big, big
                    stuff.”</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I had also been interested in Anwar Sadat and his impact on the relationship
                    between Israel and the U.S. He was the first Arab who was intelligible to us and
                    seemed like a major player. King Hussein had been intelligible, but never seemed
                    a major player. To most Americans, all other Arabs had seemed exotic beings on
                    the fringe of our ethnocentric view of world history. Israel had produced a
                    series of leaders who were perfectly intelligible to uBen Gurion, Meier, Aba
                    Eban, Rabin, Perez and so on. Even Menachem Begin, while different in style from
                    those Labor party stalwarts, was a recognizable figure to most Americans. They
                    spoke English well and looked like big timers. So, except for a few lonely
                    voices among academic and State Department Arabists, the Israelis had a virtual
                    monopoly on interpreting the Israel Arab dispute to Americans. Then along came
                    Sadat and the all important interview he did with, I think, Barbara Walters. His
                    English was good and he was charming. He had the wise habit of slowing down when
                    he had to search for English words which often made him sound more profound than
                    foreign. From that time on the Israeli monopoly was broken. They still had a
                    substantial lead, but they were going to have to share U.S. fora with Arab
                    voices.</p>
                <p>So there I was checking into the King David Hotel. I went to the embassy control
                    room to find out what the hell is going on and looked out the window. There was
                    the city of Jerusalem laid out in a panorama with lights on the walls. It is a
                    stunning sight. It sort of bangs you right between the eyes in terms of what
                    kind of history you are looking at. I didn't learn as much as I should have,
                    because there was an emergency message that my mother had gone in for emergency
                    surgery and wasn't expected to survive. So before that visit was over, I was on
                    a plane back to the United States.</p>
                <p>My mother did not survive. It was a sad time in Florida where my parents had
                    moved after my father's retirement. I was there through the memorial service and
                    few more days to spend time with my Dad. I then went through Washington for a
                    couple more days of consultation. So it was ten days or so before I got back. I
                    remember being very impressed at how solicitous David Hitchcock and the rest of
                    the post were in helping my wife. After all, we had just arrived and Keiko was
                    pregnant with our second child, our son as it turned out. We had moved into a
                    modest, but pleasant furnished U.S. government owned house. Due to a large
                    amount of counterpart funds, and true to Israel's socialist tradition, the State
                    Department had built lots of identical houses throughout Tel Aviv's pleasant
                    northern suburbs. There were two types of houses, larger ones for embassy
                    department heads and smaller ones for the rest of us. The larger ones were what
                    the department calls “representational housing”large enough to accommodate a
                    reception for a couple hundred tightly packed people and fancy enough so we are
                    not out shown by the Europeans. If there were extra bigger houses they went to
                    lower ranking officers with big families.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Wen I got back and began to settle into the job, I realized was different from
                    any other information officer job I had ever seen. I began to figure out that a
                    great deal of my time was going to be taken up with VIP visits. I think probably
                    the American in Israel developed the best VIP team in the foreign service. We
                    got very good at it because we did it all the time. Since almost every VIP visit
                    generated questions from the presbefore, during and afteand because almost all
                    visits brought along a press contingent, the press section was an important part
                    of the team. It sometimes seemed I spent half my tour living in the King David
                    Hotel in Jerusalem. That's an exaggeration, but during a couple round of the
                    talks on Palestinian autonomy the talks were extended and we ended up sending
                    cars down to our homes in Tel Aviv to pick up clean clothes.</p>
                <p>We also had a large resident U.S. press corps in Israel, mostly in Tel Aviv,
                    which meant almost daily questions from them and from Israeli and European
                    journalists which had to be taken very seriously. USIS officers by trade,
                    training and temperament are inclined toward serving the local press first, but
                    in countries like Israel, and a few other big players, you quickly learn that
                    what the U.S. press says plays first in Washington and can get you in hot water
                    very quickly. You also learn that the big American dailies, the networks and the
                    international wire services have a great influence over the local press in the
                    country where you serve. Getting it right with AP, or Reuters, or the New York
                    Times may also be the best way to get to local dailies and broadcasters.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the U.S. and international press was there in impressive numbers and for
                    the most part they were very good. Has great influence over the press in your
                    country. It seemed to me we had as many as any embassy in the world. Maybe there
                    are more U.S. journalists in London or Paris, but they don't have as many
                    questions to ask the American embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there, they are concerned with American policy. And
                        in London they go all over the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In a way, our policy toward Israel is absolutely a given. It has been
                    remarkably consistent. But the Israelis don't think so, therefore many Americans
                    didn't think so either. The Israelis are constantly taking the temperature of
                    the relationship. The major Israeli papers had good reporters who were almost as
                    active in asking us questions as the American press was. And pretty much the
                    same questions. If you are serving in Equador, you will get journalists asking
                    questions about what we think about the Peru Equador border. Or if you are in
                    Bolivia, they would ask about access to the sea, or GSA (General Services
                    Administration) sales of tin. Those are questions that no American reporter
                    would ask. That doesn't happen in Israel. The questions you get asked in Israel
                    are the questions that any American journalist would ask, and almost all of them
                    have to do with the constant probing for the current state of the
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>That, plus the frequent VIP visits left little time for the traditional, long
                    range information activities that would be done at other posts. I didn't have
                    time to try to hunt up a copyrighted article and take it out to get some
                    newspaper to publish it because I thought it was a good enlightening article.
                    And I suppose there was less need for that in Israel. The Israeli press also
                    maintained correspondents in the United State. Wolf Blitzer at that time
                    represented the Jerusalem Post in Washington. Maariv, Ha'aretz and Yediot
                    Aharanoth also had full time correspondents in the United States. On of the sure
                    signs that we were not like other USIS posts was that we never dealt in Hebrew.
                    When we had a press release to put out, it was in English. Later in my tour, I
                    thought I would put out a press release in Hebrew just to prove we could do it.
                    The first thing I found out was my best people weren't all that good in Hebrew.
                    They were Israelis who really spoke English and otheEuropean languages or Arabic
                    somewhat better than they did Hebrew. I probably only had two people who could
                    write Hebrew well. Next, I found we didn't have a Hebrew typewriter until
                    somebody went down to the basement and found one.</p>
                <p>We dusted it off and gave it to a brave volunteer typist. It must have taken her
                    three hours to prepare the press release. She kept almost falling out of her
                    chair every time the carriage would zoom off in the wrong direction.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the Israeli press was very good, and free, although subject to influence
                    like all newspapers are, even when they don't admit it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political orientation? One hears about all
                        these different parties - was this a concern. Would the correspondent from
                        such and such a paper ask you some question that had very strong religious
                        overtones?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: We didn't get a lot of those kinds of questions. This goes back to
                    history too. Begin had come to office when Sam Lewis was on the plane on his way
                    to Israel, about a year before I got there. Begin won the election, and that was
                    a big surprise to a lot of people; Washington did not anticipate that it was
                    going to happen. Sam Lewis got there, and to USIS' credit, the one person that
                    knew Begin and could arrange a meeting was the PAO who had had some contact with
                    Begin. Begin represented a different kind of political power in Israel, and a
                    different kind of person. It is a dynamic that still works in Israel. The Likud
                    Party proceeded from East European political origins, but had as political
                    campaigners a natural affinity for the Middle Eastern Jews who felt they were on
                    the downside of Israeli society and were not getting a fair deal. I think a lot
                    of the Likud leadership was especially sensitive to that, because they had come
                    out of societies where they felt that way. The Labor Party had had its origins
                    among the Zionists of Western Europe. It was one thing to be a Jew in Vienna, no
                    bed of roses, but it was better than being a Jew in Poland. So the Western
                    European founding fathers of Israel were people who knew what anti Semitism was
                    about and knew less violent levels of persecution, but didn't know pogroms first
                    hand. Those in Eastern Europe did. Begin often liked to tell people how he had
                    imprisoned by both the Nazis and the Russians. He came to power with a coalition
                    of conservative, European Jews, and a lot of support from the Sephardic, or to
                    be more accurate, Jews of Middle East origin, as their major supporters. That
                    was a new political game for Israel. At the same time, the Jews of Middle
                    Eastern origin were beginning to wield real political power in Israel and
                    beginning to become the majority of the citizens of the State of Israel.</p>
                <p>But to go back to your question, we did not get a lot of questions with a strong
                    political slant to them. In Latin America, for example, you often get questions
                    trying to ferret out whether the U.S. government is favoring one political party
                    or another. Israelis do not ask exactly those questions. I think there was a
                    general assumption that the U.S. had grown fairly comfortable with the Labor
                    Party over the years, but was now doing its best to get used to Begin and a new
                    style of leadership. Israel is too confident a country to waste time worrying
                    about whether the U.S. is going to land the marines or throw the next
                    elections.</p>
                <p>Actually, I think we did have to learn a new style. I remember once sitting in on
                    a meeting of embassy officials with senior Israeli government officials and
                    noticing the Americans were all wearing Ben Gurion style open collared sport
                    shirts under their suit jackets, while the Israeli government people were all
                    wearing ties. Those were power ties worn by people who felt little need to
                    identify with trade unionists or kibbutzniks. We learned to put our ties back
                    on.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I also don't remember questions coming to us at the embassy with a particular
                    religious slant to them. Israel is always concerneone might even say obsessewith
                    such questions. This was the period of the “Who is a Jew” debate. I guess most
                    people probably did not consider the American Embassy particular relevant to
                    such issues. The National Religious Party was in the hands of Yosef Burg, who
                    was a very sophisticated orthodox Jew, certainly not a fundamentalist zealot in
                    any way. He was very well educated, very sophisticated, and a very wise
                    gentleman. There was nobody trying to trip the embassy up on some theological
                    issue. On political issues relating to the peace process maybe, but not on
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Unlike some other countries I know, there were no journalists in Israel relying
                    on the U.S. Embassy or USIS for the answers to generalized questions about the
                    U.S., its culture, etc. They came to us with questions about the U.S. government
                    and its policies. It was a very day to day operation in the press section. Of
                    course there were scholars and others using the USIS library for research on
                    broader issues, but that stuff was not coming to the press section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the press as far as its ability to deal
                        with you in a legitimate way? If you would say something was off the record,
                        would it stay off the record? Would quotes be checked out? In other words,
                        they wouldn't abuse relationships.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In the first place, I never used the term “off the record” because off
                    the record is a bad deal for everybody. You are saying to the journalist “You
                    can't say this.” What if he gets it from another source? Then you are putting
                    him in an unfair position. Also, it implies a level of protection that you
                    should never count on because you are not going to have it. “Deep background”
                    would be as far as I would go. “Deep background” means you can say this, just
                    don't attribute it. “Background” means you can say it, but attribute it to a
                    formula that we will agree upon. I don't ever remember being screwed in any way,
                    but I always tried to deal as much on the record as I could. A press attach? is
                    in a difficult position at times. Remember, he is always the first person that
                    is suspected when there is a leak. In reality he is probably the last person to
                    leak, because he knows he is the first person to be suspected. I did not do that
                    with very many journalists, and when I did do it, it was with journalists,
                    mainly Americans, who I trusted. Frankly, we trusted certain members of the
                    American press more than we did certain members of the Israeli press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the American correspondents who you
                        particularly liked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, gosh, it's hard to remember names now. Jay Bushinsky, but I can't
                    remember who he worked for now. Bob Simon was there with CBS.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you draw a difference between the television and print
                        journalists? Was there a difference in dealing with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh yes, there is a lot of difference. You have a whole different level
                    when dealing with television, which is often on a very technical level. Where
                    can I get my cameras, and what can I film? My memory of it is that we tended to
                    do more background type stuff with print journalists. Television copy is pretty
                    truncated. There is not much room for a lot of speculation, and I think one of
                    the things you have to remember with all press is they are not scholars trying
                    to gain a global understanding of the issues. They are persons who have a story
                    in their mind and they have places in the story that need to be filled with
                    something. They have questions that need to be answered. There is another reason
                    to be careful of the ground rules - if this person has a real good story going,
                    and he really needs that piece, he probably won't totally screw you, he will
                    just open the F stop a little bit. He'll change “deep background” to
                    “background” or do something like that. I don't remember getting stung with
                    anything too badly, nor do I remember Sam Lewis getting stung too badly. U.S.
                    policy in Israel is complicated. As many people have observed, it is not exactly
                    what the State Department says it is. It is a very complicated, shifting
                    baseline that has to do with what the Department thinks and what the White House
                    thinks and what congress thinks and what some lobby groups of people think.</p>

                <p>DIETERICH: No. I wasn't dealing with congressional delegations as much as I was
                    dealing with official negotiating groups. This was the period of the autonomy
                    talks. So you had personalities like Bob Strauss who was there as a negotiator.
                    Walt Stoessel came out, and most notably, Phil Habib. And of course Kissinger
                    had been there before my time, So a lot of those things were the kinds of visits
                    I was talking about. And Secretary Haig came.</p>
                <p>I do not share, nor do I like, the foreign services' prejudices against
                    congressional delegations. Maybe I've not served in the right places, but I
                    haven't seen much of the electioneering and tourism that some people talk about.
                    I've seen some delegations where some people don't work but other people do, and
                    I guess I was always in the position of not getting stuck with taking care of
                    the people that didn't want to work. I felt that in Israel, and also in El
                    Salvador. If I were a congressman on a committee with foreign affairs
                    responsibilities I would travel, and I would do it holidays and weekends. I
                    doubt that I would care much about some FSO whining about the extra work.</p>

                        flow of congressmen who wanted to get his or her picture taken.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: But that's okay if they are willing to do some work in the meantime.
                    What I mean by work is: showing up, paying attention, being patient with
                    briefings, being courteous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a long account of Sam Lewis, and I just finished a
                        long interview with his DCM, Bill Brown, a part of that time, and it sounds
                        like the ambassador and the DCM spent most of their time driving back and
                        forth to Jerusalem. Or being called in the middle of the night, sitting in
                        on cabinet meetings or the immediate aftermath. It sounds very hectic, very
                        personalized, and the sort of thing you don't want the press to know every
                        move because it interferes with the process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It does, but it doesn't. In the first place, you have to assume the
                    press knew of every move. Usually when Sam Lewis would go up for a meeting with
                    the prime minister, or the foreign minister, I would usually go with him because
                    the press stakes out the prime minister's office in Jerusalem so you can't get
                    in and out without them seeing you, especially when you go in with the kind of
                    security package that American ambassadors have. Secondly, because we never knew
                    when the Israelis were going to have their spokesman in the meeting, it was my
                    job was to go up there, and as we stood around waiting for the prime minister to
                    be ready, I would see if the spokesman was going to the meeting. If he went in,
                    I went in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this understood or were you sort of using your
                        elbows?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, it was understood. Certainly those were the ambassador's
                    instructions. We got friendly enough so I could go ask him if he was going in or
                    not. Even then, you didn't know whether he was going to brief anybody. Usually,
                    if I asked a question he would say, “Oh no, I'm not going to talk about this.”
                    But then maybe he would or maybe he wouldn't. Then it would be important that I
                    had also been there to do any repair work that might be necessary. It didn't
                    happen often that we got caught by surprise, but more often than not I would end
                    up in some important meetings that press attaches in most countries never got to
                    see. The first meeting I went to, I didn't go in, so I was hanging around all by
                    myself out in the foyer of the prime minister's offices. Some nice lady came and
                    offered my a cup of tea and some cookies, and it was Mrs. Begin. This was heady
                    stuff for a younger officer. I met the prime minister within a week of coming to
                    the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the relationship between Sam Lewis
                        and Menachem Begin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Most of these meetings were big with around 20 people in the room, and
                    that doesn't give you a very good feel for what the relationship was really
                    like. I never saw any indication of any kind of rancor or annoyance. There
                    seemed to be a relationship of mutual respect. Begin was not a person who
                    trusted people easily, but I think he trusted Sam Lewis. He trusted his honesty
                    and truthfulness, and he trusted him as a pretty accurate representative of what
                    U.S. policy was. Ambassador Lewis certainly had unimpeded access to the prime
                    minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of some of the other players?
                        Let's see, Moshe Arens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Moshe Arens was in the cabinet at that time. I think he had
                    agriculture. I had this impression of a person who spoke English like an
                    American. I remember when he became foreign minister, we had to figure out a way
                    to say discreetly, “Pick up the passports” for his children. He had to quietly
                    give up his American citizenship in order to serve in that post. That was toward
                    the end of my tour. I'm trying to think of the other impressions I had.
                    Sharovolatile, extremely funny, a lot of fun to talk to at a cocktail party.
                    Once there were three or four of us around, and at that time we were in the
                    first blush of people from Israel being able to visit Egypt. So a lot of people
                    were taking trips right away. The means of transportation were not very well
                    established, and there were a lot of stories about how to find the best way to
                    get there. Sharon had recently visited Cairo, so I asked him how he got there.
                    He said, “Do you mean the first time or this time.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the first time he had gone there he was the
                        commander of the army that crossed over the Suez Canal and reached the
                        outskirts of Cairo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: But he was volatile, and certainly seen by us as dangerous. He was a
                    hawkish right winger, who was convinced in his mind that he was going to have to
                    fight everybody. Most likely he thought he would have to fight the Egyptians
                    again. Most certainly he was convinced he was going to have to fight the
                    Syrians. His was the policy line that says that Israel should never give up an
                    ounce of territory for anything, that settlements ought to be built, that
                    Israel's security is bound up in the idea of yielding nothing and taking every
                    opportunity possible to expand Israel's security perimeter. He was not a man of
                    compromise when it came to the defense of Israel. ShamiShamir had been named
                    shortly before I got there. My memory is that he was not Begin's first foreign
                    minister, but now I can't remember who preceded him. I remember going to one of
                    the first meetings, probably with Strauss, and it was pretty painful because he
                    couldn't speak English very well. It was difficult for him to communicate.
                    Eventually he got better at it, which was a remarkable accomplishment. With
                    Shamir, you had the feeling that Begin was running the foreign policy that he
                    wasn't a great creative, independent voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved when you sat in on these meetings,
                        particularly American delegations; did you notice the first 45 minutes would
                        be a lecture on Judaism and the claims to Sumaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It depended on what the meeting was about. If there were visiting VIPs
                    that Begin felt needed the lecture, you better believe they got it. The one I
                    remember most vividly is Habib's first meeting. Begin did what he often did with
                    American newcomers to the game and that was to lay a mild guilt trip on them. He
                    talked about his own personal history, the holocaust museum, and all the things
                    he had suffered and the things the Jews had gone through. Habib was a tougher,
                    smarter customer than most, so he countered with stories about when he was a
                    little kid growing up as a Lebanese immigrant kid in New York and being the
                    gentile who lit candles in the synagogue.</p>
                <p>Most of the time, Begin was an extraordinary performer. He was masterful at using
                    his own emotions and his emotions were genuine. He did feel genuine rage at the
                    holocaust. He did feel genuinely that it is very hard to trust a non Jew when it
                    comes to Jewish issues. He was very good at being convincing because he rode on
                    his own emotions, he let them go, and he showed them. He could also turn them
                    off when it was time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were being tested to
                        find out whether you were friendly to Israel or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, from time to time in conversation that would happen. A lot of
                    Jews, especially European Jews, do think that most non Jews are anti Semitic.
                    Sometimes it is hard for Americans, because even when their minds are tinged by
                    anti Semitism, they certainly don't think they are anti Semitic. And they
                    certainly don't think they are anti Israel. If you look at it, the people I
                    think are anti Semites in this country, many of them are very pro Israel, but I
                    think they are often pro Israel about the way some racists in the 19th Century
                    were pro Liberia too. They thought if those folks had a place to go they would
                    be more likely to leave. A lot of far right evangelical types in the U.S. are
                    very pro Israel because they think some kind of goofy Book of Revelations
                    prophecies are being worked out, but many of their other attitudes are shot
                    through with anti Semitism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were on the cusp of a
                        generational change? This is a new group that would not have the same
                        ancestral memories.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely, and in the first place we had already seen a certain
                    generational change, not so much in absolute chronological terms, but rather in
                    terms of the role played in the foundation of the state of Israel. That was the
                    change from the leaders of the Labor Party, the founders of Israel, to the
                    leaders of the Likud who represented people who fought the British mandate tooth
                    and nail as well as many of those who had been rescued by Israel. The people of
                    the Likud may have owed a debt to the founding Zionists, but that did not mean
                    they shared their political values. I'm dealing in very broad generalizations
                    here, but I like broad generalizations. A privilege of retirement.</p>
                <p>The Likud victory also brought oriental Jews more solidly into Israeli politics.
                    Begin won partly because he got lots of votes from oriental Jews. I am using the
                    term oriental instead of Sephardic, because I think Sephardic more properly
                    refers to Jews whose diaspora took them first to the Iberian peninsula and other
                    Mediterranean locales. To me, the term oriental Jews refers to those who in a
                    sense were not part of the Diaspora, those who had remained in the Middle East
                    and who immigrated to Israel after 1948, often because they were the victims of
                    heightened anti Semitism. They were certainly not attracted to Begin on purely
                    ethnic grounds; culturally and politically he was very much a product of his
                    East European upbringing and political fortunes. He often pointed out that he
                    had been imprisoned by both the Germans and the Soviets. I think the Israelis of
                    Middle Eastern origin, who were close to a majority in Israel, were attracted by
                    his outsider status. Since they had never felt really accepted by the
                    westernized leadership of the Labor Party, or by the rank and file trade
                    unionists and kibbutzniks for that matter, they somehow identified with Begin.
                    Perhaps they saw him as a fighter who had contributed to the foundation of
                    Israel, but who, like them, had always been rejected by the establishment.</p>
                <p>The election of Begin and the rise of the Likud to power had two effects on
                    Israeli policy: It toughened attitudes regarding Israel's security and the
                    Palestinians and it created new difficulties for their lobbying efforts in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>The new Israeli government didn't have that English accented (either American or
                    British) parliamentary patina that we were accustomed to. The generation who had
                    learned their politics in the reasonably polite Zionist circles oLondon, Paris,
                    Vienna or New York and had successful lobbied international opinion for the
                    partition oPalestine were replaced by a government of people who had learned
                    their politics in the ghettos and death camps of Eastern Europe, or in Cairo or
                    Damascus or Amman or even Teheran. The common experience that brought them
                    together was their service in the Israeli army, where as lower ranking people
                    they had done at least their share of the bloody work of war. Begin and a lot of
                    his inner circle had even got a head start as anti British terrorists during the
                    mandate - the bombing of the King David Hotel and all that.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>We Americans sometimes like to think that somehow those who have suffered
                    repression or prejudice will know better than to ever inflict it on others. I
                    wish that were true, but I think it rather goes the other way. Victims become
                    desensitized and find it distressingly easy to mistreat others, especially if
                    they perceive them as enemies. It's like the victims of child abuse becoming
                    abusers. It happens all the time. What this meant for Begin is that his core
                    supporters were even tougher than he was on issues relating to the Palestinians
                    and Israeli security. Especially after Camp David, he found himself in the
                    anomalous position of having to prove that he hadn't given away the store.</p>
                <p>The second effect was on the American public. All of a sudden here, is Menachem
                    Begin who doesn't really fit the American image of an Israeli leader. You have
                    to remember how attractive people like Rabin, Dana, Ever Weizmann, Golda Meir,
                    or Aba Eban were on the American circuit. They fit our image of distinguished
                    foreigners and were easy to relate to. I'm getting into some unpleasant areas of
                    our own prejudices now, but the fact is to many Americans those leaders seemed
                    much more Israeli than they did Jewish. Then here comes Begin. He is small and
                    unprepossessing looking and his accent is central European. He doesn't seem like
                    this European sophisticate so much as he seems like the person who ran a candy
                    store on the corner of an American city. He seems more American than say
                    Weizmann or Eban; he doesn't quite have that distinguished foreigner gloss. And,
                    given the latent anti Semitism of many Americans, he seems more Jewish than
                    Israeli.</p>
                <p>Its an important image shift. On the one hand you have the Ben Gurion, Meier,
                    Dayan image of the heroic little democracy, that just happens to be Jewish,
                    defending itself against evil Arab armies. On the other hand, you have the
                    Begin, Shamir, Arens image of a militantly Jewish ghetto plunked down in the
                    Middle East and refusing to yield anything to the at least somewhat reasonable
                    concerns of its neighbors.</p>
                <p>Then you factor in the Camp David agreements and Anwar Sadat. He becomes the
                    distinguished foreigner. Sadat's English was not all that good, but he had
                    mastered the trick of speaking very slowly, which made him sound like he was
                    wise and pondering every word. He came across as the good Middle Easterner we
                    could all relate to. The unreasonable and mysterious Arabs had been replaced by
                    Anwar Sadat. The Arab side of the equation now had an effective spokesman.</p>
                <p>At that point opinion in the United States began to evolve in the direction of
                    the Palestinians. It could have gone much worse for the Israelis had it not been
                    for Arafat. He was not handsome or suave and came across worse than he deserved
                    to in the American media. Every time Began would say something outrageous to
                    appease his most militant supporters, Arafat would counter with something
                    equally outrageous to his Palestinian public. The couldn't have been more
                    coordinated and mutually supportive had they been on the phone every
                    morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>So, Israel's support in the U.S., while still strong, was showing signs of
                    erosion. That was also happening in the embassy. There was increasing sympathy
                    for the Palestinian cause, or at least increasing sympathy for the Palestinian
                    people. And eroding sympathy for the government of Israel. Begin knew that and
                    it really annoyed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it was bound to happen, having the characters who
                        were portrayed. These people are appealing to a broad audience, particularly
                        in the United States. Many of the actions could no longer be portrayed the
                        way it used to be. It was Golda Meir who would say “There is no such thing
                        as a Palestinian, they are desert Arabs.” That didn't play anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's right, and somehow the Begin people made themselves look much
                    more intransigent than the early generation of leaders had looked. Part of it
                    was Camp David. There was a perception on the American side that Begin was not
                    living up to the Camp David agreement. The issue of West Bank settlements came
                    to the fore very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling there in the early stage of Camp
                        David?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The feeling was that Camp David was U.S. policy and it had to be
                    implemented. I don't remember people in the American embassy spending a lot of
                    time in breast beating over whether it was a good idea or whether we were paying
                    too much for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an active watching to see how Camp David was
                        being implemented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, absolutely, sure. Remember we had these negotiating missions
                    coming in all the time. It started with the autonomy talks. One of our big
                    issues was keeping autonomy talks going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Autonomy being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Autonomy for the regions of Israel where Palestinians lived, the West
                    Bank and Gaza. Some kind of self government for those places. The other issue
                    was the staged withdrawal from the Sinai. Those were things we were
                    concentrating on all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Various groups, like Phil Habib and others like Strauss,
                        would come in - what was your role? Would they come in with their own
                        spokesperson or did Sam Lewis or you have to sell yourself each time? Would
                        you explain what I'm talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, Bob Strauss, Sol Linowitz, Phil Habib and Walt Stoessel came in.
                    I may not have the order exactly right. They would not come with their own press
                    apparatus. It is not like a big VIP or Secretarial visit. Sam Lewis would
                    introduce me to whoever came and tell them I would be going around with them,
                    and sometimes going into meetings, and, at other times, not going into meetings,
                    depending on what the Israelis did. That was pretty much it. I would either go
                    into a meeting or I wouldn't, and if I didn't go into the meeting I'd stand by
                    with the press and shoot the breeze with them. It often was time well spent in
                    terms of getting to know what was on their minds without having to cope with a
                    lot of office and deadline pressures, and a lot cheaper than paying for
                    lunches.</p>
                <p>When it was time for the principal to come out, I would try to intercept him
                    while he was still inside the building to find out if he wanted to talk to the
                    press or not. If he did want to talk to them, I'd rush out and say let's go to
                    the press. The visitor would usually do the pretty standard “yes, we had a good
                    meeting with the prime minister, the foreign minister, and I am confident we can
                    achieve progress.” The extraordinary thing about the American press in Israel,
                    was that they never gave up trying.</p>
                <p>Now, with Phil Habib the mission was different. Remember there were a lot of
                    problems with the security zone the Israelis were maintaining in southern
                    Lebanon. If we are going to get into the Lebanon issues, I have to tell you an
                    anecdote beforehand.</p>
                <p>Because Habib was in and out for a number of missions, and because his
                    negotiations concerning Lebanon were even more delicate, he made it clear to me
                    that he was happy to have me around, but there could be no leaking to the press.
                    He said to us one time, “This job is hard enough to do without being able to
                    control my own agenda. I have to be able to go to the Syrians and Lebanese and
                    say 'Here is what the Israelis said, and here is the message I am bringing to
                    you, and here is what I need your reactions to.' I need to be able to stick with
                    my agenda and raise issues in the order I want them. It really hurts if I have
                    to deal with leaked versions that got there before I did.” I absolutely
                    sympathized with that and we ran a very tight ship up until the point when he
                    wanted to talk to the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked a bit about Camp David. What about in November
                        1979, the taking over of our embassy in Teheran? Did that have much of an
                        impact in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It certainly was a major story, but it didn't have much of an impact
                    on the embassy or my office because the story was elsewhere. Had I been in
                    Brazil, for example, when that happened, somebody might have come to me to get a
                    reaction. The Israeli press was sophisticated enough and had enough
                    correspondents to rely on Washington for U.S. Government reaction to events
                    happening elsewhere. It was not a major concern during office hours, although it
                    was a hot topic of conversation at cocktail parties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it did, because we were pretty concerned early about Israeli
                    support of the Iranians. But it was nothing we talked about. And it was nothing
                    the press came and asked us a lot of questions about. They probably figured out
                    that we weren't going to talk about it. I don't remember ever taking any
                    questions on that subject.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a subliminal problem of the military relationship between the United
                    States and the Israelis? I'm particularly thinking that the Israelis were a
                    drain on our professional fighting force. Did this come up?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember that as a matter of much concern, or as a sentiment
                    expressed by U.S. military reps in Israel. What I do remember is going to a
                    ceremony when the first F 16s were delivered to the Israelis. They flew all the
                    way across, nonstop, with aerial refueling, because none of the countries en
                    route wanted them to land.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sitting in the cockpit of an F 16 for that long, yes. It was one of
                    these big occasions in Israel when everybody was invited. They sent up an
                    Israeli Air Force F 4 Phantom to escort them in to the field. The announcer
                    pointed out how long after you had seen the Phantom it would be before you could
                    see the F 16s. They were that much smaller.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lets talk about the invasion of Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Now I have to tell you what led up to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we actually get to that, you have the Carter
                        administration who brought about the Camp David agreement. How was Carter
                        perceived after Camp David?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Since Sadat was much more beloved in the United States than Begin was,
                    I think Carter was much more beloved in Egypt than he was in Israel. The Likud
                    government was a conservative government and I think that, despite the fact that
                    they had signed at Camp David, there was a feeling that he wasn't really
                    sympathetic to Israeli security interests. There was a slight feeling of
                    mistrust; his instincts couldn't be counted on to protect Israel the way the
                    instincts of some other presidents had protected Israel. There is something to
                    be said for that, too.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the advent of Ronald Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They liked him, a friend of Israel. He was not going to ask them to
                    make sacrifices of their own security. One of the things about peace making is
                    that it is based on compromise, and compromise is made by giving something up.
                    There are lots of people who say they are peacemakers but basically they just
                    want to win. Jimmy Carter's message to Israel was they had to give things up and
                    had to take risks for peace.</p>
                <p>Now that is a tough message. It may be tougher for Jews than other folks,
                    especially for the very orthodox. The origins of kosher cooking, for example,
                    come out of a biblical injunction to not cook a kid in the milk of its mother.
                    The need to avoid this fairly simple scenario evolved into a complex set of
                    rules and customs designed to eliminate even the slightest risk of a violation.
                    So, you have a people whose whole cultural background is not big on risk taking
                    to start with, and then you put that together with a horrifying history of
                    people who took the risk of staying in Nazi Europe and died in the process. Or
                    of people in other places taking risks to get along with gentile society, and
                    then finding their windows broken or worse. In many ways, many Israelis are
                    liberal in their politics, but not liberal when it comes to taking risks. Carter
                    was asking them to take risks, to take a chance on peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Soviet Union play any role at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not much on the issues I was dealing with. Begin was uninterested in
                    relations with the Soviet Union, beyond badgering them over treatment of Russian
                    Jews, and the release of Russian Jews, and increased immigration of Russian
                    Jews.</p>
                <p>Q: From your perspective, were there problems with our consulate general in
                    Jerusalem? Did they have a different press to deal with, and how did that
                    work?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, they had a whole different press to deal with and a whole
                    different job. From and embassy point of view, I suppose it kind of annoying to
                    have a consulate general in the country that does not report to you but reports
                    directly back to Washington. But is that a daily annoyance? No, it is a fact of
                    life. We knew the East Jerusalem Consulate has as its primary job getting along
                    with Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did press relations come up with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I can't remember any of the Arabic language Palestinian papers or
                    stations ever directing a question of any kind to the embassy in Tel Aviv, or to
                    me during my long stays in Jerusalem. It was simply understood that their
                    diplomatic contact was the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem. But I think beyond
                    that their journalists hadn't really developed the knack of running down stories
                    by buttonholing people. They just waited for press releases. For instance, if
                    they had been asking questions about Linowitz' or Habib's activities, I think
                    the Consulate would have relayed those questions to me. I don't remember that
                    ever happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Egyptian press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: . I actually can't remember any Arab journalist ever asking me a
                    question, not even the Egyptian journalists who covered some of the autonomy
                    talks. But that may have simply meant that I wasn't doing my job very well.
                    Actually what I have said is not quite true. I did have some conversations with
                    Israeli Arab and Druse journalists. As you know there are Arabs who remained in
                    Israel and have Israeli citizenship - about half a million of them when I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>I do remember well the Egyptian Ambassador, who cut quite a figure when he first
                    arrived. We all knew him on the diplomatic circuit. I may have forgotten, but I
                    cannot recall a single instance of any substantive conversations with Egyptian
                    journalists in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now let's go to Lebanon. You wanted to say
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Before we go to Lebanon, I have one more story to tell. About half way
                    through my time in Israel, my old friend from Argentina, Jacobo Timerman, showed
                    up. During most of my time in Brazil and as the ARA press officer he had been
                    either in actual prison or under house arrest. His book, Cell without a Number,
                    Prisoner without a Name, of course came out of that horrible experience. During
                    my time in Washington I had written a number of press guidances for Hodding
                    Carter urging the Argentine government to release him.</p>
                <p>The Argentine government was having none of it. They couldn't stand the Carter
                    government, and had particular dislike for Hodding Carter's wife to be, Pat
                    Derian, who was of course the Assistant Secretary for human rights. One of the
                    dumber stories on the streets of Buenos Aires, a city that has more than its
                    share of urban legends, had it that Pat Derian was interested in Timerman
                    because she was his cousin or niece or something like that. I think they simply
                    could not fathom the idea that a government - any government - actually cared
                    about human rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Timerman's decision to come to Israel after his release from house arrest
                    attracted a lot of attention. We had lunch shortly after his arrival and his
                    reaction to Israel was fascinating. There were too many military uniforms around
                    for his taste and too many military people with influence in the government.
                    Eventually he ended up at odds with the Israeli right and returned to Argentina,
                    despite having told a lot of people he never would. His son attracted some
                    notoriety by refusing Israeli military service. I guess even very bright people
                    see what they are conditioned to see. We learn from our nightmares. For Timerman
                    the greatest internal danger to Israel was a military coup; for me it was too
                    many years of Likud government.</p>
                <p>Now for Lebanon. I was thinking of my early days in Israel and my introduction to
                    the delicacy of Lebanon issues. Somebody on my staff suggested I needed to get
                    out and see some of the country. We had a visiting group of journalists coming
                    in on a program for publishers and editors of small newspapers. My staff thought
                    I should travel with them. I agreed. The visiting journalists were being hosted
                    by the Israeli government, so I went up to Jerusalem to pick them up, and joined
                    the party and their Israeli military guard. We were going to northern Israel,
                    the town of Metula on the Lebanese border. I noticed out guide, an Israeli army
                    officer, was insistent on rushing us through some things we were looking at,
                    because he wanted to get to lunch at a restaurant in Metula. I wasn't
                    particularly suspicious, it just seemed to me he was worried about his
                    schedule.</p>
                <p>We got to Metula and were having lunch when all of a sudden our guide said “Well,
                    aren't we lucky. Look who has just arrived. What a coincidence. There is Major
                    Haddad.” Some coincidence.</p>
                <p>Major Saad Haddad was the head of the Israeli sponsored Southern Lebanon
                    Christian Militia, and a person with whom the U.S. government would have no
                    dealings. All I knew at that point was that I was not supposed to have any
                    contact with him. So, Haddad came over and the Israeli introduced everybody to
                    him. I hung back so I wouldn't be caught near him. Then they got to talking and
                    the Israeli said “Gee, Major, couldn't you take these people over to visit area?
                    Major Haddad said he would be delighted and most of the journalists said they
                    would like to go. I thought, “Oh, Lord, these people are going to leave Israel
                    and go into Lebanon. Now what do I do.”</p>
                <p>I got the journalists off to one side and said, “Look, you are not supposed to do
                    this and I certainly cannot go with you, and if you go there you are outside any
                    protection the American Embassy can offer you. What you are doing is contrary to
                    U.S. policy.” That had no effect whatsoever on anyone but one very nice older
                    lady who was the publisher of the Baltimore Afro American. I would like to think
                    that my pompous little speech convinced her that it was unpatriotic to cross
                    into Lebanon, but I suspect she just needed a little rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>So they all took off with Major Haddad, and the lady from Baltimore and I sat and
                    had a very pleasant visit, drinking Coke in the Metula restaurant. Finally, they
                    all came back and we finished the rest of the tour. I reported the whole thing
                    to the Embassy the next morning and was told I had done the right thing. The
                    point of the story was that we had an understanding from the Israelis they would
                    not do that, before this group toured. They broke that agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things I get from people talking is that the
                        Israelis are pushing things to the ultimate, did you get that feeling when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it's history and culture again. I think there is a mindset that
                    says you are being irresponsible if you don't do the most you can to benefit
                    your own people. It's a hard thing to explain, but it is the real thing and it
                    is not confined to Israelis either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Listen, I served in Korea and this is the Koreans,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It's the reaction of people who have been pushed around. If you had
                    the luxury of being raised a nice secure, mainstream American WASP, you are kind
                    of embarrassed to push too hard for your own advantage and the advantage of your
                    family. But I think people who grow up in disadvantaged circumstances, and their
                    children, develop a different kind of morality. People who have had to fight to
                    survive learn to take care of those closest to them first. We feel bad when we
                    have engaged in some act of nepotism, which we do anyway every now and then, but
                    a lot of Latin Americans and Israelis may feel bad when they don't take care of
                    their own first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mentioned the Koreans. The Japanese tried to wipe out
                        the Korean language and the Korean culture. When you deal with the Koreans,
                        they are plain pushy. Did the subject of the Arabs in Israel or on the West
                        Bank come up much in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, and it came up very early. You find when you go to Israel,
                    Israelis keep telling you how many Arabs live in Israel - the Israeli Arabs, the
                    good Arabs and the Druse, who enlist in the army and live here with full rights
                    like everybody else. There are about a half a million Arabs and Druse who live
                    in Israel. It is all true, but it doesn't mean what some Israelis think it
                    means. What it means to most Likud supporting Israelis is roughly this: those
                    people on the West Bank, those people in the camps, those people who left when
                    they didn't have to, should have stayed because it is perfectly feasible for an
                    Arab to be a loyal citizen of Israel and to receive all the benefits of being in
                    this country. And the people who didn't take that offer from the State of Israel
                    should stop complaining, get out of the camps and go live in some Arab
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pointed out that Captain Sharon was blowing up
                        Jewish homes at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That doesn't usually doesn't come up in the same conversation, unless
                    you bring it up. It depends on who you talk to. Sure, there are Israelis that
                    will tell you, “Yes, we have five hundred thousand Arabs, but they don't have
                    the same rights, it doesn't mean anything, and we have behaved badly with this
                    problem.”</p>
                <p>There are a bunch of Israelis that we sort of think of as the left, but really
                    aren't, who believe Israel should trade some territory for security. They also
                    believe that Israel has not treated Arabs well, that injustice was done. There
                    are many Israelis, maybe even a majority, who believe that Arabs live
                    comfortably in Israel with full rights of citizenship, and that means to them
                    that the problem isn't exactly as most of the world sees it. It is true they
                    live there in peace, but if you talk to a lot of them they don't think they have
                    the same rights in practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we might leave the Lebanese thing for another
                        session. What about the nuclear business, was that something that we
                        pussyfooted around? (End of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I don't remember ever dealing with that subject as press attach?. There were just
                    some things you didn't talk about because there was nothing of certainty that my
                    world, or the press, could deal with in any effective way. Everybody knows what
                    the truth is, it's like dealing with the old incident of the USS Liberty. There
                    wasn't anything left to say about it that could be said. There are certain
                    topics in the U.S. Israeli relationship that you just don't want to talk about,
                    and we've not talked about them for so long, nobody bothers to push very hard
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that particular time, did you get involved in the
                        briefing on the care and feeding of the American Jews who came to Israel in
                        groups? You must have had them once a week.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I didn't do much of that, those were not considered to be press
                    issues. The ambassador and some others in the embassy would meet with prominent
                    groups that came in. I just didn't have time for anything but the press stuff.
                    It often depended on what kind of group it was, and if they came with academic
                    credentials or academic interests, the cultural attach? would brief them. Sally
                    Grooms was a very distinguished counterpart in the cultural section (and someone
                    you folks should intervieSally Grooms Cowal).</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, the last name is Cowal. You really ought to get her.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, she is here in town. She was head of Youth for Understanding, and
                    she was in Geneva on a United Nations assignment. Before that, she had been a
                    DAS and was also the ambassador to Barbados. She will soon be the president of
                    the Cuba Policy Foundation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, good, we'll go after her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: She is really something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm keeping the Lebanese off to one side, but can you
                        think of any issues that came up where the embassy was portrayed as being
                        off base or unfriendly? In other words, you had to do some damage control.
                        Were there any problems you can think of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember any major situations where we were accused of being
                    out of sync with policy. They probably occurred, but never to the extent that
                    they engaged my office in a big way. But that raises another interesting
                    technical issue.</p>
                <p>We had no way of reading the U.S. press. I got up early and listened to the Voice
                    of America, which was quite helpful. Since most embassy people listened to BBC
                    which is available in Israel on medium wave, I often I knew more about what was
                    happening in the U.S. than others did. There was no way for us to get advance
                    copies of U.S. newspapers. There was no way for me to find out what the hell the
                    State Department spokesman had said, except to sort of sense that something had
                    gone wrong and to call George Sherman, who was the press person in the Mideast
                    bureau, and find out what the hell the spokesman had said. That was not
                    something you could do every day.</p>
                <p>Q: When you serve there, you certainly feel the intensity of life. The work was
                    hard but the Israelis were a lot of fun. It was not like being at an Arab
                    post.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was great fun. I had a wonderful time. I worked like hell, and sort
                    of neglected my family. When my son Robby was born in the Assuta Hospital in Tel
                    Aviv, my wife's obstetrician said, “The Assuta Hospital is a great hospital but
                    it is a bad hotel.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: It had very primitive rooms and services. I remember being surprised
                    when the nurse, who was examining my wife during labor, was wearing flip flops
                    and smoking a cigarette. That was kind of cute. I was supposed to stay and be
                    there at his birth but, as usual, I went out to make a phone call. We had just
                    realized we had left the house without leaving a note for our daughter. I had to
                    stand in line to get to the pay phone. By the time I made the call and contacted
                    our daughter, our son had already been born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Jeff, why don't we stop at this point. We will pick
                        this up - what did you call it there, the invasion oLebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It finally became an invasion oLebanon. This was mainly in '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will pick that up. You mentioned that, when you were
                        avoiding Major Haddad with a group. Anyway, we will pick that up next
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Great.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 6th of January 2000. Jef- Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Right. The roots of the Lebanon issue go back well into '81, when the
                    Israelis did some strikes beyond what was known at that time as the “red line”,
                    which was the line that defined the zone that Israel was controlling through
                    Major Haddad and his Christian militia. Then that led to the Syrians putting in
                    some antiaircraft missiles in the same area. In the meantime, the PLO saw its
                    chance to get both sides to escalate. The United States began to see a great
                    danger in this and brought Philip Habib in on a series of missions to deal with
                    that particular issue. His technique was to shuttle back and forth, in sort of
                    on a tripod type shuttle - Jerusalem, Beirut, and Damascus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I did. Again, it was one of these things where we never knew for
                    sure what the Israelis were going to do in terms of publicizing the events at
                    meetings. They were very situational on this. If they felt there was something
                    to be gained by making public the contents of the meeting, and making public
                    their position, they would do so. Ambassador Lewis and Phil Habib felt it was
                    important that I be along to counter, if they should do that. We would be
                    unlikely to be the first to go public with something, but we had to be there to
                    defend ourselves if they did. Again, it was sort of the rules we had established
                    between Ambassador Lewis and Prime Minister Begin. I would show up with the
                    delegation, and if the Israelis ran in one of their press people into the
                    meeting, I would go in, too.</p>
                <p>Habib made it very clear to me at the beginning that he would have nothing to say
                    to the press. He said, “It is difficult enough to do this mission when I have to
                    shuttle between here and Damascus, or here and Beirut, and to take Israeli
                    positions to the other parties. In order to do that effectively, I have to be
                    able to control the agenda. What really drives me crazy is, if I go, and before
                    I can say what I want to say, I have to contend with versions that have been
                    leaked to the press.” I think that was absolutely correct; I think it was
                    absolutely sound technique. I did my best to ensure there were never any leaks.
                    He would occasionally ask me what the press was thinking, what their concerns
                    were, and eventually use the press. It was mainly a lot of standing around.
                    There would be a meeting and Habib would come out and the press, in a good
                    humored way, would try to get him to say something. At one point he came out and
                    said, “You know me - old silent Phil.” The press misheard what he said and
                    thought he had said “silent film,” which shows how they were thinking, sincethey
                    were mainly television journalists. The phrase “silent film and silent movies”
                    had a lot of currency among the press at that time. Of course, I never told them
                    anything. I would stand around outside meetings and talk about other things and
                    do pretty good contact work with people and made a lot of good friends. That's
                    the way it had to be - always with Habib, but never talking to the press.</p>
                <p>The meetings at times were a lot of fun. Often we would gather at the Jerusalem
                    Consulate, which Brandon Grove was in charge of at that time, as Consul General,
                    and had some wonderful evenings. Brandon was an excellent host, and Habib held
                    forth at the dinner table, more often than not about what was wrong with the
                    foreign service. “This modern age of sissy diplomats who are overpaid and under
                    worked.” That was happening during 1981.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this when the Israelis went into Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, this was before. The Israelis didn't go into to Lebanon until June
                    of '82.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that Sharon and company were
                        cocking the rifle, ready to do something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Eventually, yes. But we are not quite there yet. As I remember, it was
                    in the fall of '82 that Habib finally achieved a minor miracle diplomatically,
                    in that he got a de facto cease fire between the Israelis and the PLO, as far as
                    southern Lebanon was concerned. This was done by Habib making a statement which
                    neither side denied, which is the way you dealt with the fact there wasn't going
                    to be any kind of a joint document between the PLO and the Israelis, nor any
                    kind of joint statement. When that was finally achieved, Charley Hill and I were
                    hanging around the consulate, and Habib was off some place, but I don't remember
                    where. Not with the prime minister, probably at the foreign ministry, and for
                    some reason I hadn't gone along. I got a call from Habib's party saying he
                    wanted to talk to the press right away. I'm sitting there at the consulate
                    thinking, “How in the hell am I going to get in touch with the press and put
                    them with Habib?” Charley and I talked for about 15 seconds, and it finally
                    occurred to us that we had to figure out a way to get to the prime minister's
                    office because that is where the press was. We decided to call up Begin and say
                    Phil Habib wants to come by and say good bye to him, because he was leaving.
                    That is exactly what happened. Otherwise, I think I would have been screwed. So
                    we all went to the prime minister's office. I'm proud of the fact that I was
                    standing there with Phil Habib as he announced the cease fire and took some
                    questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the statement say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The statement basically said both sides had agreed to stop shooting.
                    There were some questions about what geographic area this actually entailed. It
                    was a good moment for U.S. diplomacy. The cease fire lasted for awhile, it
                    bought some time, and it established an important principle that de facto
                    arrangements between the PLO and Israel were in fact possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Habib dealing with the PLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know. He was dealing with them through the Lebanese government
                    and the Syrian government. The trick was to read a statement and let it stand
                    with no denials. It worked, it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Israeli press coming around? Were most of them
                        hoping for a peaceful solution or was the press so politicized that you
                        could almost write the news or editorials of each paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Your question sort of contains the answer. It is a pretty politicized
                    press. I don't mean it is a dumb politicized press. It is a smart politicized
                    press. Most journalists are probably more inclined towards the peace side than
                    the war side in Israeli politics. We often misunderstand the Israeli attitude
                    toward war. Let me explain that. I remember once I talked about going on that
                    trip where I almost met Major Haddad. One of the standard stops on that tour was
                    to go up to the Golan Heights. We were among a huge number of tourist groups and
                    others who had been taken to the Golan Heights to look down on Tiberias and see
                    how vulnerable Israel is, and how narrow Israel is, at that point. While I was
                    up there one of the Americans said to me, “But why are the Israelis so worried
                    all the time? They always win.” The more I thought about that question, the
                    dumber I realized it really is. After all, at the end of a war when you win, the
                    people that died aren't resurrected. Besides, it was a pretty near thing in '73.
                    Israel could have lost that one, had it not been for massive shipments of arms
                    from the United States.</p>
                <p>Going back to your question, Israeli journalists are pretty professional. They
                    don't wear their ideology on their sleeve. You have to worm it out of a lot of
                    them. That is especially true of those journalists that were covering the
                    American Embassy, covering foreign affairs. They were sophisticated types who
                    spoke English well, were educated, and really understood both the questions and
                    the answers. I found them a pleasure to deal with, and equally the U.S. and
                    European press. They were all pretty good. It's kind of like what Sam Lewis said
                    to me about being press attach? in Israel, “It's center court Wimbledon.” Israel
                    is a hell of a good assignment for an American journalist who wants to make his
                    career as a foreign correspondent. Israel has been a surefire front page story
                    for the last half century.</p>
                <p>Q: A number of the press representatives (I'm talking about media, not just
                    press), had Jewish backgrounds. Did that make much of a difference?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That is a hard thing to assess, because it depends on the individual.
                    There are American Jews in IsraeI'm not talking about only the press corps, but
                    sometimes among American diplomats too, who buy into the Israeli story
                    excessively, in my opinion. There are American non Jews that do the same thing.
                    In a sense, they lose some of the objectivity they should have. There are also
                    American Jews who go the other way. They almost overcompensate and sort of
                    become remarkably suspicious of what the Israeli government says. At times they
                    gloomily pessimistic about the future of Israel and the nature of its society.
                    You also have to remember there are a lot of Israelis who are pretty pessimistic
                    about the nature of Israeli society, and are absolutely opposed to the
                    government. Elections in Israel are close run affairs. If you were on the side
                    of peace, you didn't feel you were isolated in Israel, there were a whole lot of
                    Israelis who were with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, while Habib was working on a cease
                        fire and up through the time the Israelis went into Lebanon, were we
                        monitoring the Begin Cabinet to see where they were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: In early 1981 there were elections, and Likud barely squeaked through.
                    Out of that they lost some support in the coalition they had prior to the
                    elections, that is they lost some moderate support. The second Begin cabinet was
                    a lot tougher than the first, mainly because Moshe Dyan had resigned before the
                    end of the first cabinet. He felt he was getting nowhere with Begin and did not
                    have enough influence over Israeli policy. He was eventually replaced by General
                    Ariel Sharon, who was a hard liner, very tough, and absolutely convinced that
                    Israel was going to have to fight another war at some point. Personally, I think
                    he relished the prospect.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, relationships with the United States weren't going very well.
                    There were a number of irritants, among those were the sale oAmerican Naval
                    AWACS Aircraft to the Saudis. That drove the Israelis crazy. They envisioned
                    these planes up there capable of monitoring everything that happens on Israeli
                    air bases. They felt that maybe the Saudis weren't very anxious to be in another
                    war with Israel but, if there ever was another war, the Saudi resources would be
                    used somehow or other. The other factor was the end of the Carter
                    administration. The Israelis were never really fond of Jimmy Carter. I think
                    there was a feeling that they had been pressured at Camp David. There were some
                    genuine misunderstandings about what had been agreed to at Camp David,
                    especially on the issue of settlements.</p>
                <p>I think Carter believed that Begin had undertaken not to build any more
                    settlements during the time that negotiations were ongoing. Begin's contention,
                    I think, was “that was during the Camp David negotiations, and I didn't do
                    that.” Carter's interpretation was that it meant during the period of the
                    negotiations of all the things that were implicit and written into the Camp
                    David agreement, such as Palestinian autonomy, and the final withdrawal of
                    Israel from Sinai.</p>
                <p>At any rate, Israel immediately began building settlements again on the West
                    Bank. Carter felt betrayed by Begin, and Begin felt he was being held to
                    something by Carter that he had never agreed to. With the beginning of the
                    Reagan government, the Israelis felt they had a person who was basically
                    sympathetic to them, and an administration in the United States that was not
                    going to push them on things like the autonomy talks. They believed that Reagan
                    was not going to expect Israel to make sacrifices, because this would be an
                    administration that would recognize the great contribution Israel had made to
                    the U.S. Crusade against communism. The Israeli contention was that they had
                    been a real asset to the United States and it was about time the United States
                    recognized they were a strategic allThe hope of the Begin government was to get
                    some kind of recognition of the Israeli contribution out of the Reagan
                    administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Initially, the Reagan administration was not very interested in the autonomy
                    talks, but after awhile they began to come around. Haig began to realize this
                    was a good idea so he began to lean on the Israelis to get going. The Israelis
                    didn't like that very much. Then there were other irritants, little scandals
                    would come up. Somebody would say the wrong thing in a meeting someplace, and
                    the Israelis would pick it up.</p>
                <p>Bring me back to where I'm supposed to be - how did I get on this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the Reagan administration coming in.
                        It is not just foreign diplomats who are trying to figure out what the
                        Americans are up to, the American diplomats were probably wondering where
                        they stood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The most immediate concern in the embassy was - will the ambassador be
                    re appointed? Fortunately, he was re appointed, as were the other ambassadors in
                    the region, which was a very sound decision considering what was in play. I tend
                    to remember in terms of specifics - what was going to happen with the autonomy
                    talks.</p>
                <p>As I said before, being a press attach? in Israel was very peculiar, we were very
                    event driven, so I might try to meditate on the broader implications of policy,
                    but what really was in play was who was going to replace Saul Linowitz, and how
                    was he going to be to deal with. The sooner we would get some information on
                    these people, the sooner we could get it out to the press and start preparing
                    the way, because everything gets harder when you have to do it cold. What are
                    new traveling delegations going to be like out of this administration? What is
                    the new secretary of state going to be like? What is the administration of USIA
                    going to do in terms of our resources? Will we get better communications than we
                    had before, or are we going to sit and fight with antiquated systems as
                    usual?</p>
                <p>The autonomy talks were interesting and frustrating. You would end up with these
                    big meetings with big delegations from Israel, Egypt and the U.S. Although I
                    might accompany the principal U.S. Negotiator to preliminary courtesy meeting
                    with senior government officials, I don't believe I ever sat in on an actual
                    negotiating session. There was a sound understanding that press people were not
                    to be included. It worked.</p>
                <p>There was a fair amount of backgrounding of the press after the sessions. People
                    would come out of the meetings and say, “Well, it's 80% done.” That got to sound
                    pretty hollow after a while because that 80% depended on how you counted things.
                    The 20% that was left was the stuff that wasn't going to get done. It was like
                    you have a building all built but no roof, and you have no idea how to build a
                    roof.</p>

                <p>We went to a meeting at the defense ministry and I guess the defense spokesman
                    was in because I ended up in the meeting. This was the meeting where Sharon came
                    on with maps and outlined what he characterized as his plan for the invasion of
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A kind of “What on earth are you talking about?” reaction. Well, it
                    caused a lot of excitement. There were a lot of cables that went flashing out
                    after that, and Habib and everybody were stunned. Our military attaches were
                    with us, it was a fairly large group of people that was there. It was an amazing
                    briefing. I don't remember that the ambassador was there, I guess he was off
                    someplace.</p>

                        setting up his own policy, or trying to force an issue? What was the
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think the evidence was that this plan had not been vetted through
                    many other places in the Israeli government. I'm not even sure he had gone
                    through the prime minister. If he had gone over this with the prime minister it
                    probably had been in the most theoretical terms. I'm pretty sure a lot of folks
                    in the government didn't know about it. If the foreign minister knew, he
                    probably had no idea of the extent of Sharon's planning. I think Sharon was
                    trying to do two things. I think he was trying to get us used to the idea and
                    gauge our reaction. And maybe he used this as leverage to get it through his own
                    government. He could say, “I've already told the Americans about this.” Sharon
                    had this alarming capacity of not listening to arguments that went against what
                    he wanted to believe. The trouble with dealing with people like that is it is
                    very hard to warn them, because if you tell them they have a terrible idea and
                    we are not going to support you, and his reaction will be, “Oh, yes, I hear you,
                    but that is just rhetoric, what are you really going to do?” Unless what you
                    said was accompanied by some kind of catastrophic threat, he would kind of toss
                    it aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what led up to Saddam Hussein, he didn't realize we

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think that is right. I don't think he really believed we wouldn't
                    stop them, and he was probably right too. But on the other hand, you don't make
                    catastrophic threats when dealing with Israel because the press will pick it up
                    and you will face all kind of hell in both the U.S. And Israel.</p>

                    hard for us to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Sharon went and talked to Haig and came back and
                        claimed he was given a wink, or a green light to do this - was this before
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I believe it was after. Sharon went to Washington, and has some
                    sort of conversation with the Secretary. Maybe Haig was overly diplomatic
                    because lots of people believe Sharon took it as a wink and a nod.</p>
                <p>Anyway, that is the problem with Sharon. We were caught in a terrible dilemma
                    because whatever happened was going to become public. If Sharon didn't make
                    things public, Begin did. They both really believed in using the press and using
                    foreign opinion to their advantage. Sometimes that tactic would backfire and
                    work to their disadvantage but they had a hard time recognizing when that
                    happened. Here is your dilemma - if you make a statement mean enough and tough
                    enough to get Sharon's attention, it would be absolutely offensive to friends of
                    Israel all over the place. To put it bluntly, a statement tough enough to move
                    Sharon is going to offend the hell out of the Jewish community in the United
                    States. That's the problem. The tone with Israel always has to be, “We are
                    trying to be helpful to you, and we can help you better if you don't go ahead
                    and do this.” The language of diplomacy doesn't deal much in ultimatums and
                    nasty language, but anything short of an ultimatum would not have been
                    understood by Sharon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been difficult for you all, particularly on
                        the press side, if the Begin government was using aimed press releases all
                        the time which always involved the United States one way or another, this
                        meant you were having to react all the time. You couldn't be giving out
                        press statements to preempt this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was not so much a matter of formal press releases as it was
                    backgrounding to individual journalists and thinly disguised leaks. We were not
                    helpless. We could and would and respond at least in terms of backgrounding.
                    There were a number of techniques we would use. Occasionally we would make a
                    statement through Washington, and occasionally we would get part of what we
                    wanted to say out through the department spokesman.</p>
                <p>Sam Lewis did a lot of backgrounders with the press, both one on one meetings
                    with the press, plus in meetings open to almost all the U.S. Press, or meetings
                    with selected members of the Israeli press. We rarely mixed the Israeli and U.S.
                    press in one meeting, because we felt there was a different understanding of the
                    traditional guidelines regarding attribution. I would arrange meetings in the
                    USIS Library, where Sam Lewis would take questions and do very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>But you are partly right, we never could respond with the kind of punchy quality
                    that the Israelis used. Part of it because it is not in our nature and partly
                    because it wouldn't be accepted in terms of our own domestic politics. Also
                    because the whole time I was there we were in a kind of mediator role which
                    meant you shouldn't be punching back at the person or you would destroy your
                    effectiveness. Sometimes we had to swallow it and couldn't respond very well. I
                    once described my tour in Israel as like a permanenRoadrunner cartoon where you
                    get to be the coyote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any difference between what was coming out
                        of The New York Times, which was owned by a Jewish family, and The
                        Washington Post, which did not have the same constituency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No. I really didn't. It was an interesting time to serve in Israel, in
                    the sense that it was a period of increasing skepticism. The bloom was off the
                    Israeli rose, it was no longer a matter of “poor little Israel.” Golda Meir, Aba
                    Eban, Moshe Dyan, and the almost larger than life figures were very good in
                    communicating with Americans. It was a different kind of Israel, a period of
                    increasing sympathy for the Palestinians and a certain amount of impatience with
                    Israel. The old answers wouldn't work anymore. That old dialog the Israelis had
                    going, when you would say, “Well, don't you think you're being kind of mean to
                    the Palestinians?” And they would say, “Look what happened to us in the
                    Holocaust” didn't work anymore. You had a new generation of Americans who would
                    say “so what, the Arabs didn't do that.” You were getting toward an era of more
                    pragmatic politics dominated by the horror of the Second World War. Israel, from
                    the outside, was beginning to look more and more like a bully. I must say when
                    you live in Israel you become more conscious of the vulnerability of Israel in
                    military terms, and at times the fragility of the Israeli political system. It's
                    a very difficult, very personality driven system, run by a small group of people
                    who know each other altogether too well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the orthodox parties? I would think it would be
                        very hard for an American to have any understanding or feeling about them.
                        They have the word of God; they don't participate in the military side of
                        things. A real problem for the development of modern Israel. How did you all
                        feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: There are sort of two ways of looking at it. There are the ultra,
                    ultra orthodox, the Mea Shearim crowd, folks who think history stopped someplace
                    in the 18th Century, and dress accordingly. Some may occasionally throw stones
                    at passing cars on the Sabbath, but most of them are very withdrawn from every
                    day political life. They in themselves are not terribly important in Israeli
                    politics. I remember one very secular Israeli friend of mine who said, “You have
                    Indian reservations and we have Mea Shearim, and neither society is willing to
                    do anything about them, because we sentimentalize thethey are part of our
                    past.”</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The national religious party, however, is a party of very sophisticated orthodox
                    Jews. These are people who do not shun politics. They are very good at politics,
                    and they have been the swing party in most elections, the coalition maker. They
                    have exacted their price almost every time in terms of making sure reformed
                    Judaism is not really recognized in Israel; making sure that Israel shuts down
                    for the Sabbath on Friday nights; doing things like trying to get all flights
                    grounded out of the airports during the Sabbath. No buses running on the
                    Sabbath. All sorts of things which are the result of coalition politics which
                    drive most Israelis absolutely crazy. Probably a majority of Israelis are really
                    quite secular people who see their roots in Judaism as cultural and terribly
                    important, but are not very observant Jews. On the other hand, you can't form a
                    government without taking into account the sentiments, feelings, and political
                    goals of orthodox Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move up to when things were heating up along the
                        border. The Lebanese invasion was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In May of '82. By that time I was nearing the end of my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were out before it happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I was out at about the middle of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the feeling at the embassy? Were we at all
                        concerned about what Sharon had done when he went to the United States and
                        got the so called green light?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't think we ever believed that he really had. He just thought he
                    had. The question is one, I'm afraid, that divided counsels within the U.S.
                    administration, too. I think there were certain people who thought we couldn't
                    blame the Israelis because they were subject to constant artillery attacks. They
                    retaliate, but who wouldn't? After all, those people they are protecting in
                    Lebanon are Christians and we ought to be sympathetic with them. I suppose it is
                    true that the Reagan administration came to power owing something to evangelical
                    groups in the United States. Haddad and his people knew how to appeal to right
                    wing evangelicals and had contact with them. So did Begin and his people.</p>
                <p>We in the embassy knew, in fact, that an invasion of Lebanon was terribly
                    destabilizing in terms of long term U.S. policy in the region. But there were a
                    lot of people in the Reagan administration who weren't really willing to come
                    out absolutely against the Israelis in this thing. There were also Reagan
                    insiders who shared the Israeli notion that Israel deserved U.S. support because
                    of its contribution to our cold war concerns.</p>

                        there would be air strikes, was anybody toting up how many Israeli civilians
                        were killed as opposed to how many Palestinian civilians were killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Very few Israelis were killed in those raids. Anybody in a war is
                    pretty much trying to make sure that he doesn't take many casualties. The
                    Israelis got very good at building shelters, the Katusha rocket was just a piece
                    of artillery. It had no real guidance system. They could figure it might hit a
                    particular town, but that was the best they could do. The Israelis got used to
                    spending nights in shelters. I'm sure Israeli retaliation took many more lives
                    than they lost, buI can't imagine anybody's national policy being based on “as
                    long as they don't kill more of our people than we kill of theirs, that will be
                    okay.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, but I was wondering if this was of concern.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was a concern, but the Israeli answer was always, “Look, we are
                    trying to limit civilian casualties. We are doing the best we can” I don't think
                    the Israelis ever deliberately targeted some civilian area that didn't have some
                    sort of strategic interest. The Israelis were, after all, interested in killing
                    PLO, not in killing Lebanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seemed like the event that precipitated this whole
                        thing was the sad attack on the Israeli ambassador in London.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: There was the attack on the Israeli ambassador in London, followed by
                    an Israeli air strike on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon, followed immediately
                    by a major barrage of artillery of Katushas from PLO sites into northern Israel.
                    That is what did it. There really was an outbreak of real shooting going on. It
                    was funny how I found out about the actual move into Lebanon. At the end of May,
                    our daughter had a date with an Israeli student at her school to go to her
                    senior prom. On the day of the prom, late in the afternoon, she got a call from
                    the kid saying, “I'm calling from Lebanon and I'm sorry I can't make it back for
                    the prom.” I got on the phone right away. It was one of the first confirmations
                    we had that they were really that far up into Lebanon. I think young man was
                    calling from Tyre or Sidon. Mari, now a foreign service officer herself, has
                    been lunching on that senior prom story ever since. It's the kind of foreign
                    service childhood story that makes it all worth while.</p>

                        years later about how he and the attaches would be reporting what was

                        the embassy in Tel Aviv told them they really weren't doing this. Were you

                <p>DIETERICH: I'm trying to remember when I left. The invasion happened in late May
                    and I left very shortly after that. As press attach?, I might not have been
                    seeing some of that stuff, although I saw a fair amount of the outgoing
                    traffic.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: My reporting responsibilities had to do with the media. In some ways
                    that means it would have been our job to report what the Israelis were saying
                    about what was happening. You are doing your job as long as you identify the
                    source.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In terms of the progress of the war? I just can't comment on that. I
                    was almost gone, probably by mid June. There were a couple of other things I
                    wanted to cover.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Sinai.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: As you know, the Camp David agreement called for further negotiations
                    to bring about a staged withdrawal from the Sinai. In terms of background, we
                    already had the Sinai field mission out there, which had come in after '73 as an
                    early warning peacekeeping operation. This basically put seismic sensors and
                    television cameras into the Giddi and Mitla passes to make sure that neither
                    Israel or Egypt would be subject to a surprise armored attack by the other. I
                    visited that operation once. It is a really bleak and strange operation, run by
                    foreign service officers and some military people, plus a contractor, E Systems,
                    who provides most of the logistics. E Systems was also eventually involved in
                    the Sinai Multinational Force also.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I have a story I love to tell out of that visit. I went out with one of the
                    people from the mission to a remote site in one of the passes where there was a
                    remotely controlled television camera. He was showing me how this television
                    camera could move, could be directed from their central operation. He said,
                    “There is this Bedouin that comes by every now and then and we've got him
                    believing that he controls the camera, because when he stares at the camera and
                    moves his hand to the right, we move the camera that way. Then when he moves his
                    hand the other way, we move the camera accordingly. He loves it and thinks he
                    controls the camera.” I think there is a lesson in Middle East politics in the
                    story, because in a sense he really was controlling the camera.</p>
                <p>The Israelis and the Egyptians both, as we came down to the deadline for
                    withdrawal from the Sinai began to get cold feet. Sadat was having second
                    thoughts because he was getting beaten up by the Arabs all over the place and he
                    was tired of it, and because he feared the limitations he had accepted on
                    Egyptian military activities in the Sinai would only buy him more grief. The
                    Israelis were deathly afraid, in retrospect, of establishing a precedent which
                    would then be applied by somebody to the Golan and the West Bank. After the
                    death of Sadat, and Sharon coming to power, it came down to “I know we have to
                    give up most of it, but we can't give up everything, we have to keep something.
                    We have to renegotiate this somehow. We just can't give up the whole Sinai.”</p>
                <p>This led to a whole bunch of really dumb disputes. The most egregious being
                    Taaba, which was down on the Red Sea, just around the corner from Eilat. And
                    there were other kinds of trial balloons - “Can't we hold onto the air bases?
                    Why should we give up all this oil?” The department sent Walt Stoessel out, who
                    was the undersecretary for political affairs, I think, to negotiate and to work
                    with the Egyptians and Israelis on this. He did a fine job, and again it was one
                    of those missions where I spent a lot of time cooling my heels in offices,
                    waiting to see if anybody needed the press. It was finally worked out. An
                    agreement was signed under somewhat strange circumstances due to considerations
                    of who was to sign and where. On the Egyptian side I think it was signed by the
                    Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv, which is where he lived at least.</p>
                <p>The withdrawal came to pass with a number of results. I think, in some ways, what
                    Israel gave up has not been fully appreciated in the rest of the world. The
                    Sharon tactic of trying to hold on to little enclaves was just silly. All it did
                    was take away from Israel some of the international credit it should have gotten
                    for a remarkable sacrifice. Who has ever given up a lot of territory without
                    being beaten?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to some of the people who had been on the early
                        peace missions who said there was a lot of Israeli testing, trying to take
                        more in than they were supposed to. When you look at it, it was almost kid
                        stuff - just testing - and it got everybody mad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: So much of this was Sharon driven, in my estimation. A little bit
                    Begin driven too. What history should remember is that Israel gave up oil
                    resources and air bases. Now they have a couple of new air bases in the Negev
                    built for them by us. Those aren't as good as having the whole Sinai. The Sinai
                    was a great training area for the Israeli air force, and they don't have the
                    space they had. There aren't very many examples in history of people giving up
                    that kind of territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any experience with the Egyptian press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A little bit, yes. I made one trip to Egypt after Camp David when
                    travel to Egypt became possible. I worked out a deal with the PAO in Cairo to
                    send a car down to meet me at the border. I rode in the car all the way through
                    the Sinai seeing the hulks of burned out tanks along that road into Cairo. It
                    was a marvelous trip and I did talk to some Egyptians while I was there, sort of
                    the guest of USIS in Cairo. I don't remember running into Egyptian journalists
                    on a regular basis. They would come when you would have the autonomy talks
                    delegation, when an Egyptian delegation would show up. One of the jobs to be
                    done during the period of negotiating withdrawals from the Sinai was setting up
                    the Multinational Force and Observers, which is a fascinating story in itself.
                    Again, these were negotiations the press was interested in, and I had to follow
                    and got to know the people that were involved in that operation too. I don't
                    know whether this is the time to tell how it works or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Part of the deal from the very beginning was that the United States
                    would try to get the UN to put a peacekeeping mission into the Sinai. To get the
                    agreement signed, we basically had to say “and if the United Nations won't do
                    it, we will do it.” Well, guess what! Of course the United Nations wouldn't do
                    it. There was no way we were going to get the Security Council to approve a
                    United Nations peacekeeping operation in the Sinai. Remember, the Russians had
                    been cut out of the Mideast peacekeeping, peacemaking process - the Camp David
                    process - early on, and they were always unhappy about that. Not nearly as
                    unhappy as the Israelis would have been had they been brought in.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Anyway, as it turned out, we had to do it by ourselves. Basically, we had to go
                    out and find countries willing to contribute. Early on we got the Colombians and
                    the Fijians in because they are perennial peace keepers. They had been doing
                    this for quite a while. Then we had a flurry with the Israelis when we wanted to
                    get some Europeans in. The Israelis were doubtful about having the Europeans in.
                    Doubtful about the British, because of the Mandate history. Doubtful about the
                    French, because they felt the French were too close to the Saudis, and the
                    French history in Lebanon had complicated things a lot and for the region also.
                    They were also somewhat suspicious of the Italians and I could never quite
                    figure out why, since everybody likes the Italians. But maybe one of the clues
                    is that those Israeli oil fields that were given up in the Sinai were run by
                    ENI, the Italian governmental hydrocarbons conglomerate. Finally, the Israelis
                    consented, and the French, Italians, and the British agreed to come in, as well
                    as Australia and New Zealand. We got a Norwegian General, Frederick Bull Hansen,
                    who agreed to be the commander of the outfit. The director general was an
                    American, a retired State Department Senior Administrative officer named Leamon
                    R. Hunt, known as Ray Hunt, who was later killed in Rome. Ray Hunt and Vic
                    Dikeos, who was his deputy, asked me if I would consider going to Rome as the
                    public affairs officer for the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO.) Rome was
                    a big temptation, since I had studied in Italy as a graduate student and I liked
                    Rome a loloved Italy. I talked to some people about it, including Sam Lewis, and
                    we all came to the conclusion that it would be a great press job, because this
                    thing would never work. It was going to be helthey were going to be screwed up
                    all over the place, and the Israelis and Egyptians were going to be all over
                    each other. It was going to be a very exciting time. So I thought maybe I would
                    go.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I wasn't getting much I was interested in from Washington
                    anyway. I was a little bit out of touch with Latin America by then, and not well
                    enough known in the Middle East, nor was I an Arabic speaker, so of nothing was
                    coming up that really turned me on. Nor did I relish the idea of studying Arabic
                    or trying to be a PAO in a country where I didn't speak the language.</p>
                <p>So I decided Rome might be fun, plus it was a great deal financially because it
                    was an international organization and you didn't have to pay any U.S. taxes,
                    while you still collected your full foreign service salary. So I agreed to go to
                    Rome, and that is when I left Israel and came back to the United States for
                    about two months, since the MFO had not yet made its official move to Rome. I
                    worked out of the MFO headquarters in the Washington suburb of Landmark,
                    Virginia. It was really quite interesting helping to invent a brand new
                    organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>In the first place - why Rome? The agreement itself stipulated there had to be a
                    headquarters and it had to be outside the treaty area, so we had to find a place
                    to go. Washington seemed unsuitable because it was too far away. It came down to
                    western Europe, and hopefully a place with good communications and good air
                    connections. We talked to the British, French, and the Italians and the best
                    deal came from the Italians. It was particularly attractive to us because the
                    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN was already in Rome, and that
                    provided a model for us to use with the Italians in order to establish what our
                    status would be as a foreign organization. We basically said to the Italians,
                    “Just give us the same deal and perks you gave to the FAO and we will be fine.”
                    The agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '82 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: This was '82. I only served in the MFO from '82 to '83. So I worked at
                    Landmark for awhile, and then Keiko and I, with our son Robbie, flew off to
                    Rome. Our daughter, who had managed to coincide with our Israel tour by
                    graduating from high school in three years, had just started at Harvard.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I had gotten a warning. They said “part of our negotiations with
                    the Italians was that we had to employ some Italians, and one of those people is
                    a lady named Marilena Andreotti, who is the daughter of Giulio Andreotti. We
                    don't know what else to do with her, we don't know anything about her, but she
                    is a woman, and probably knows about politics, so she should probably work for
                    you.” I said, “Fine, delighted.”</p>
                <p>She actually had gone to work before I got there, had become about the most
                    valuable person on the staff. She was the only person who knew how to do
                    anything in Rome. You had all these State Department admin officers, Australian
                    colonels, New Zealand sergeants, and one Italian diplomat, but the only person
                    who knew how to rent a room in Italy was Marilena Marri Caciotti. Not only was
                    she the daughter of Julio Andreotti, she was also married to an Italian foreign
                    service officer. She was very smart with a wicked Roman sense of humor, had all
                    the right connections, and was a delight to work with.</p>
                <p>I got to Rome and began to set up an office. I had Marilena as an assistant
                    public affairs officer, and a Frenchman who had worked for the OECD office in
                    Washington as my deputy, as well as an Italian secretary who was also married to
                    a foreign ministry official.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>There were some important relationships within the organization be sorted out. As
                    part of the deal, the MFO headquarters had taken on an Italian political
                    counselor, an ambassadorial level Italian diplomat. I'm not sure he was used to
                    the idea of a separate public affairs office reporting directly to the boss, nor
                    that he liked the idea very much. He may have suspected that as an American with
                    some kind of “political” credentials and experience in the region, I was going
                    to become the de facto political adviser to the American Director General and
                    his deputy. In addition, I think he was a bit uncomfortable with having Giulio
                    Andreotti's daughter working in my office. He may have had a point. Andreotti,
                    in one of his many political reincarnations, became foreign minister about
                    halfway through my year in Rome. I tried to make him as comfortable as possible
                    by assuring him of full coordination and explaining as clearly as possible what
                    I thought we ought to do in public affairs terms. It was also clear that Ray
                    Hunt and Vic Dikeos didn't need a whole lot of advice about the political
                    dynamics of the MFO. We eventually sorted it out and had a good working
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>The military command in the Sinai, under General Bull Hansen also had a public
                    affairs officer, an Australian army officer, who clearly preferred that any
                    dealings with the general be handled through him. I had no particular objection
                    to that, although the general liked to talk public affairs and MFO matters in
                    general with me and didn't much care whether his PAO was present or not.
                    Reasonable observance of chain of command protocol does help big organizations
                    functions, but should not be allowed to interfere with organizational
                    information sharing. Again the principle of transparency is the best solution. I
                    made sure that the Australian was aware of any conversations I had with his boss
                    and that any statements or releases form the Rome headquarters were thoroughly
                    coordinated with him. He reciprocated although I don't remember any press
                    materials being released from the military command.</p>
                <p>I did make a couple of trips back to the region, which meant visiting MFO offices
                    and embassy officials on both Cairo and Tel Aviv as well as various
                    installations and units in the Sinai. I made one trip on my own and accompanied
                    Ray Hunt on another.</p>
                <p>The trips were interesting. We would go into Cairo on a commercial airliner, and
                    consult with the embassy and with the people in the little office that the MFO
                    kept in Cairo. Then we would get on a French military puddle jumper airplane
                    (they ran our fixed wing “airline”) and fly out to the main headquarters base.
                    Then I would consult with my Australian counterpart, the public affairs officer
                    for Bull Hansen. We would spend some time together, and would also consult with
                    other military folks and the U.S. foreign service officers assigned there as
                    observers. They were the diplomats assigned to accompany patrols and sort out
                    any apparent violations. When the Sinai portion was finished a jeep or truck
                    would take us to the Israeli border checkpoint, where we would be met by a jeep
                    from the Israel side and would drive to the hotel in either Tel Aviv or
                    Jerusalem.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Due to various political sensitivities involved in that itinerary I carried four
                    passports - two diplomatic and two civilian. For some reason we were supposed to
                    use civilian passports when we were with the MFO, diplomatic passports
                    otherwise, and we needed passports that did not have Israeli stamps in them in
                    case we needed to go elsewhere in the region.</p>
                <p>On the trip I made with Ray Hunt we went all through the Sinai. It was an
                    interesting organization. The northern sector of the border area was patrolled
                    by Fijian troops, the central section by Colombian troops, and the southern
                    sector by U.S. troops out of the 101st or the 82nd Airborne. They would rotate
                    on six month deployments. The U.S. also furnished the fifty person civilian
                    observer unit. Those were the diplomatic types I mentioned before. They were
                    mainly U.S. foreign service people, although civilians could also be recruited.
                    The Australian and New Zealand armies, combined into an ANZAC unit as they had
                    been in World War II, provided helicopter transport. The Italian navy
                    contributed three patrol vessels which operated out of Sharm el Sheikh at the
                    southern tip of the Sinai. The Netherlands ran communications and a military
                    police unit, while the British provided a headquarters company. Uruguayan
                    soldiers drove the trucks and, as I mentioned before, France provided the fixed
                    wing aircraft.</p>
                <p>The MFO maintained its main base at El Gorah in the North and South Base near
                    Sharm el Sheikh, which housed the U.S. Battalion, as well as a series of
                    observation posts and check points. The construction of the bases had been
                    carried out under U.S. supervision on a fast track basis in about seven months.
                    As I remember, the cost of operation, exclusive of construction, was somewhat
                    over 100 million dollars a year, which was shared evenly between the U.S. Israel
                    and Egypt. I think the fact that the Egyptians and Israelis were paying a major
                    part of the bills had a lot to do with their commitment to making the whole
                    thing work.</p>
                <p>The two trips to the field were fascinating. I remember traveling with the
                    Director General in a helicopter and landing, apparently unexpectedly, at a
                    mountain top observation post manned by the Colombian battalion. The relief of
                    the Colombian officer in charge when I greeted him in Spanish was palpable. I
                    translated while we toured the facilities and met the lone Dutch communicator
                    assigned to the site. While he spoke English well, there seemed to be no
                    Colombians who did. I sort of wondered how it all functioned, although the
                    Dutchman was picking up Spanish. The main problem was boredom, I guess, since
                    there had never been much to observe beyond an occasional, presumably civilian,
                    camel.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>On one of the visits I accompanied a patrol which consisted of military personnel
                    and a civilian observer. It was all very routine, a long ride in the desert with
                    some stops at Egyptian military outposts. Talking with some of the people on the
                    patrol, and more of the observers later in the day, I got the impression of a
                    certain affection for the Egyptians and annoyance with the Israelis. The
                    Egyptians were sticklers for military courtesy and apparently respectful of the
                    foreigners running around in their recently recovered desert, while the
                    Israelis, never much on formalities in the first place, gave the impression of
                    constant game playing, trying to see if they could fool these observers trying
                    to function in a desert they, the Israeli army, knew very well. I can understand
                    the attitude - its both fun and pragmatic - but it makes little sense to piss
                    off the umpire.</p>
                <p>During the Cairo, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem portions of the trips I would talk to
                    journalists, usually one on one, about the MFO and its mission. These meetings
                    were pleasant and journalists were theoretically interested in the MFO, but my
                    efforts did not result in much coverage. As long as things were going well - and
                    they were - there was not going to be much press coverage. There were, of
                    course, occasional feature stories in the media of the participating countries,
                    but these were done by interviewing recent returnees or by visits to the Sinai
                    handled by well by my counterpart on General Bull Hansen's staff. Nobody was
                    going to come to Rome to write a story about soldiers and diplomats in the
                    desert.</p>
                <p>We did work the predictable, fire fighting type stories that usually result from
                    a foreign presence - minor confrontations with the police or border guards by
                    MFO people on leave in either country, traffic accidents involving Bedouins in
                    the Sinai, and so on. We also had a couple of tragic land mine incidents and a
                    diving fatality among the U.S. troops in the South. The Sinai is a wonderful
                    place, it is one of the few places in the world you can still be maimed by a
                    World War I mine. We maintained contact with journalists in Rome who represented
                    media in the contributing countries, as well, to the best of our ability,
                    monitoring the press for any MFO stories. We also did some small presentations
                    for academic people interested in the study of peacekeeping. Our major product
                    was the first MFO Annual Report a sixty page or so, fairly glossy English
                    language pamphlet aimed at the Israel, Egypt and the contributing countries. We
                    did the writing ourselves and brought it in on time for the first anniversary of
                    the force. It was okay, I guess.</p>
                <p>The worst thing about the job was that the crises I had thought would occur in
                    the Sinai, the confrontations between Israel and Egypt, never materialized. The
                    Egyptians and Israelis had decided it was going to work, and therefore it
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>There would, of course, would be screw ups. Often an Egyptian truck or military
                    vehicle would be in the wrong zone at the wrong time. There were three zones
                    with various rules for each one. The typical Egyptian mistake was not to know
                    where the hell they were in the Sinai because those soldiers who grew up on the
                    banks of the Nile were as lost in the Sinai as somebody from Kansas. Israeli
                    aircraft coming out of the new Negev air bases on training missions would miss
                    their turn by a few seconds and be halfway into the Sinai. We ended up chasing
                    down a lot of those, and movements of camels. But they were resolved almost
                    immediately by both countries.</p>
                <p>The MFO was working like a charm. So I ended up with a four person office, and
                    not a very interesting mission. I guess the moral of the story is: peacekeeping
                    is only interesting when it doesn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were used as a training exercise mainly, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, I'm not sure how good training it was for the troops on the
                    ground. Their main job was to occupy high points and watch for movement. It is
                    also kind of weird duty for the foreign service officers assigned as observers.
                    I don't it really relates much to anything else they will do in their careers.
                    But living on the bases offered time to pursue hobbies and the pay was very
                    good.</p>
                <p>I finally had decided that one of the jobs that was going to be important for the
                    MFO in the future was keeping the nine countries in. Vagaries of Mideast
                    politics, the relationship with the United States, and sheer boredom setting in,
                    and whatever else would create pressures to leave the MFO. The Italian political
                    counselor thought he was supposed to worry about that too, so we worried about
                    it together.</p>
                <p>After about a year in Rome I got a call from Ambassador Sam Hart, who had been a
                    colleague as the Economic Counselor in Tel Aviv. He asked if I would like to be
                    PAO (Public Affairs Officer, title of the chief of a country USIS post) in
                    Equador. He had just fired his PAO. I called back to USIA in Washington and told
                    them about the call and they knew he would be calling me. So I asked if it was
                    all right with them, and they said it was fine. I had not been a PAO yet, so I
                    decided if I stayed on in Rome too long I would end up retiring there. I had
                    better get out and become a PAO. My wife, as much as she loved Rome, was very
                    understanding. She had always heard, correctly, that Quito was a lovely city and
                    a nice place for kids.</p>
                <p>So that closed off my time in Rome and my on the job involvement with Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>It was an interesting and maybe an important transition. I had never served above
                    the junior level in what you might call a typical embassy. I had been with the
                    Voice of America, I had been in a very peculiar consulate general in Sao Paulo,
                    and then an extremely peculiar embassy in Israel. I had never really come to
                    terms with much of what USIS did. Even in Buenos Aires I had gotten very
                    specialized into press stuff, in one particular aspect of the press. In Israel,
                    everything was driven by the big imperatives of U.S. policy in the Middle East,
                    and this whole mission was designed around that policy. We had a MIL group and
                    an AID mission. The AID mission was two persons who handed out checks twice a
                    month. That's all they did. What I was going to learn in Equador was what it is
                    like at most American embassies. If you think about it, most foreign service
                    officers either serve at one of the big almost regional, embassies, or they
                    serve in places that are more like Equador than they are like Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Equador in '83 and you were there until
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Until '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this might be a good place to stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, it probably would be.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 24th of January 2000. Jeff, Equador, 1983. How
                        would you describe the situation when you arrived in Equador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Equador is an interesting country. It is very much an Indian country,
                    which means it has the disturbing social aspect of the Andes. That is very much
                    on our minds now because of the coup attempt they just went through in Equador.
                    The country lives under social system that is almost a kind of unspoken
                    apartheid. Although most people in Ecuador have Indian blood, those who either
                    by choice or tradition live an Indian life style and identify with their own
                    indigenous culture, are people out of the political system. They rarely, and
                    usually cannot, aspire to positions of political influence. Most of them make
                    their living in a subsistence agricultural economy.</p>
                <p>That having been said, what is different about Equador in the region is that
                    while it has a tradition of political instability, it does not have the
                    tradition of violent nastiness that haunts the politics of Colombia, Peru, and
                    Bolivia. Politics are played very hard, but there is not same fear of reprisal
                    and thirst for vengeance that has cost so many lives in the rest of the
                    Andes.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I think that fortunate difference stems from the fact that the political forces
                    in Equador are sort of evenly balanced. You have two major citieQuito up in the
                    mountains and Guayaquil down on the coast. Neither city has ever been able to
                    dominate the political life of the nation, as has been the case in Peru, where
                    Lima dominates, or in Bolivia where La Paz dominates. Guayaquil is just about
                    the same size as Quito. Although the people and the political culture are very
                    different in the two placethere is a very definite highland lowland dichotomy
                    throughout the Andethey have managed to alternate power from one region to the
                    other. Since they know the other persons are going to get power eventually, they
                    tend to treat each other badly verbally, but in terms of physical repressioit
                    rarely happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have the situation that has prevailed in some other
                        places where you have the ten or thirty big families who have won parts of
                        the country where the peasants are so downtrodden, has that system
                        developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't know how many families it would be, but there is clearly an
                    upper class that draws its power from two places. One is land itself, but the
                    other source is influence and power over people. There is also a newer class of
                    younger people who are the sons of people who made a lot of money from land or
                    even of European immigrants who worked for people who owned land. They have been
                    fairly well educated - often in the U.S. - and tend to make their money out of
                    commerce and industry. By providing services and imported goods to the
                    landowners they became as rich or richer than their customers and a whole lot
                    more capable of dealing with modern economic issues. It may be more important to
                    have a Chevrolet next to your pharmaceutical company, than it is to own a big,
                    not very efficient, hacienda someplace. A case in point would be the man who
                    became president while I was there, Leon Fibrous Corridor, whose father was the
                    overseer on one of the big estates. He was a man who made a good living and
                    changed the nature of his family by being the top person, working for somebody
                    who owned a lot of land.</p>
                <p>By the way, Equador was the model for Joseph Conrad's Nostromo. Conrad was
                    stranded in Guayaquil for awhile and took the country for his Latin American
                    republic in that very good novel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I went there as the PAO, my first experience as the head of a USIS
                    post. I was delighted to have that job, because that is what you aim for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking off mike a bit, but having come from
                        Israel, which is in continuous crisis, and go to Equador, didn't you find
                        that to not be very challenging?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I didn't feel that way at all. Remember, I had been in Bolivia and
                    lived through two coups d'etat in Bolivia, and served in Argentina in a very
                    exciting time, with the return of Peron after all those years of exile. I had
                    been in Brazil at a time when issues of nuclear power and the drug trade were
                    becoming very serious, so I didn't have that feeling at all. I didn't know what
                    was going to happen in Equador, but I had never been in a boring Latin American
                    country.</p>
                <p>Secondly, it is a lot more fun working in a country where you can speak the
                    language. Truth be told, one of the interesting things about working in Latin
                    America is that we really do The foreign service may think it does that
                    worldwide, but it is not really true. We think it is a good idea but we don't
                    really do it much outside of Europe and Latin America. Most of our hard language
                    speaking people are still not good enough to really do business in the local
                    language and we still don't have nearly enough of them. Given that Spanish is an
                    easy language, given that we have a base of native Spanish speakers in the
                    United States, you very soon get to the point where you do almost all your
                    business in Spanish. It never would have occurred to me in those countries to
                    speak English unless the interlocutor insisted upon it. Latin Americans don't
                    insist on it very often. Their attitude is, “I struggled and learned your
                    language up there in your cold and awful country, and you can damn well struggle
                    down here in mine.”</p>
                <p>And the truth is I was happy to get my own post. That would have been hard to do
                    in the Middle East area because I didn't have Arabic, and I wasn't really very
                    excited about serving in another Middle East country. Remember, I had had three
                    tours in Latin America and I liked it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I had two ambassadors: Sam Hart was the ambassador when I arrived. He
                    was later replaced by Fred Rondon.</p>
                <p>Q: I've interviewed both of them, but I was wondering... Sam Hart had come away
                    from Israel with a rather jaundiced view of our relations there. He was chief of
                    the economics section and would draw Israeli requests, only to find that his
                    professional opinion was never accepted because it really depended on the
                    political powers in Congress. I was wondering how you found him to be as an
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think Sam probably also left Equador with great disagreements with
                    U.S. policy. I think he probably left every post with great disagreements with
                    U.S. policy. That's a hard question to answer.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>The fact is, I think he got along well with Osvaldo Hurtado, the president who
                    was moderate left and replaced Jaime Roldos who had been killed in an airplane
                    crash. But, I don't think Sam had a lot of fun being ambassador. I don't think
                    he enjoyed it near as much as he thought he would. It is a hard adjustment
                    coming from a country like Israel, where people don't trust us but act like they
                    do, to a country where people do trust us but act like they don't.</p>
                <p>Maybe, trust is too strong a word. They have confidence in us to do certain
                    things and protect certain interests. He came to Equador at a time when there
                    were no particularly big problems, although elections were in the offing. He had
                    fired my predecessor. Sam had asked him to do something and the person said he
                    wouldn't do it, or at least he told the staff he wasn't going to do it. I don't
                    remember what the issue was. But I came in at his request. Sam had been a friend
                    in Israel and has remained one. But, he is an officer who believes excessively
                    in the “kiss up, kick down” style of management, except he kicks in both
                    directions - he is not very good at the kissing part.</p>
                <p>He had a strong feeling that press was very important and that I was a good press
                    officer. He also had a great fear that USIS, if you didn't watch them very
                    carefully, would go out and hire a “nose flute player” as he always said, to
                    come and put on some sort of meaningless cultural event. In all my years with
                    USIA I had never run into a “nose flute player” nor anything resembling that.
                    What we did have was a pretty good piano player or two under Charlie Wick's
                    artistic ambassador program, which was a program to help young American
                    struggling artists. It worked pretty well. We also had the Twyla Tharp ballet.
                    Now that was a big deal.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure Sam knew or appreciated how big a deal it was to get somebody as
                    important as Twyla Tharp to get her company to come and do a performance in
                    Equador. That took a lot of my time. I think the performance was during Sam's
                    time, although it may have been later. Certainly, we began working on it during
                    his time. I was scared to death that somehow I would screw up and we would have
                    to come up with some of the financing ourselves, and I wouldn't be able to
                    figure out a way to do it. Eventually, we were able to get the big municipal
                    theater downtown, which wasn't a bad venue, and talked American companies into
                    providing a lot of support by the simple expedient of suggesting they buy
                    tickets in blocks and either donate them to their staff or for public relations
                    purpose. We sold out the house.</p>
                <p>On the day after I got there, we invaded Grenada and I found myself in front of
                    the press trying to speak Spanish again, getting chuckles all over the place
                    because it kept coming out sounding like Italian. The other big problem, of
                    course, was we had elections coming up. Latin Americans always assumed that
                    Americans have some strong opinion about how their elections are supposed to
                    turn out.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The truth is we didn't have very strong opinions about how those elections should
                    turn out. But it is very hard to convince people of that. It is even more
                    difficult if you say nothing, because everybody assumes you are sulking and are
                    mad because the right wing might not win. If you try to reach out to the
                    opposition, then it's “Oh my God, you've switched sides and you want the left to
                    win (or whoever is the opposition), and this is a big change, and Lord knows
                    what you are up to, but it can't be good for us.” We approached that problem
                    lots of ways, mainly by taking every opportunity to talk about our objectivity.
                    It didn't always work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the media in Equador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was a typical Latin American construct. You had a couple of big
                    conservative, but not reactionary, dailies, one in Guayaquil and one in Quito,
                    that were pretty good and members of the Inter American Press Association. They
                    were run by people who basically believed in the free press ideas we have here
                    in the United States, although for publishers it is less of an idealistic stance
                    than a free enterprise stance. In other words, “It's my newspaper and I'm
                    entitled to have my opinions and they don't have to be the government's
                    opinions. My opinion is that free enterprise is a neat thing.” There is a lot of
                    tension between publishers and journalists, as there is in the United States. Of
                    course, the journalists tend to be more to the left of the political spectrum
                    than the publishers. But, it works for Ecuador, and the country would be much
                    poorer without those big conservative dailies.</p>
                <p>Then you had tabloids in both cities, and you had a vociferous but not very well
                    funded political press. Lots of radio stations. A.M. radio transmitters are
                    cheap, and lots of people have radios, but there is very little variety - all
                    play pretty much the same music and have the same ads. I remember only one
                    television channel at that time, government run but not ridiculously so. Fairly
                    decent news broadcasting and inexpensive American reruns, plus Mexican,
                    Brazilian, and Venezuelan soap operas and comedy shows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '83 to '86, we were at the height of our involvement,
                        under the Reagan administration, in Central America. How did that play in
                        Equador from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: You know, it's funny, I would like to say I spent a great deal of time
                    worrying about that stuff, but I really didn't. Ecuadorians really didn't care
                    very much about that. It was far away. They were interested in their own dispute
                    with Peru, and interested in the fact that they had their own homegrown
                    guerrilla group called Alfaro VivCarajo. It translates something like “Alfaro
                    still lives, by God!” Alfaro being a populist national hero of sorts. But that
                    group did not represent a particularly dangerous threat to the government. I
                    think what really happened with Central America is that it had only a symbolic
                    value. What you thought about what the Americans were doing in Central America
                    had to do with how you felt they ought to behave towards your own country. If
                    you thought there was a danger that the United States would intervene to crush
                    the guerrilla group, then you would be against that. Or if you were scared of
                    the guerilla group, then you were afraid the United States wouldn't intervene to
                    crush the guerrilla group. I don't remember being asked many questions about
                    Nicaragua or El Salvador, and I certainly did not think it was in our interest
                    to stimulate those questions. Also, the questions were hard to deal with because
                    we didn't get a lot of guidance from the department or USIA., and it is not the
                    kind of issue where you want to wing it very much. The problems were very
                    complex, and there is an unwritten rule in the foreign service, and really a
                    pretty good one, that a press attach? in one country does not generate stories
                    about events in another country without coordinating with his counterpart in
                    that country. Communications were not yet good enough among posts so that you
                    really knew how you could be helpful to your counterpart in San Salvador or
                    Managua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about drugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Drugs were an issue that took a lot of my time. There was a lot of
                    press work on publicizing what the DEA wanted, and what U.S. drug programs were
                    in Equador and why we did them. Also a lot of work on the cultural side on
                    encouraging local anti drug organizations in Equador.</p>
                <p>The absolutely correct theory behind much of the information work we did is that
                    if a country begins to participate in the drug trade, even as a transit point,
                    it would end up being a consumer. You not only become consumers, you become
                    consumers of the industrial detritus of the trade. That is why young Colombians
                    were killing themselves smoking basuco, which was made from the leftovers of the
                    cocaine trade, laced with all sorts of chemicals, might well kill you before you
                    became an addict. We were beginning to see that sort of stuff in Equador.</p>
                <p>Also, we had people important in the government whose kids picked up drug habits,
                    often in the United States. I remember doing some work with a nonprofit outfit
                    which was running drug clinics, mainly for children of the middle class who were
                    in trouble. I thought it was a good thing to do because you were hammering home
                    that message to people, “This is not something you are doing to the Americans,
                    it is something you are doing to yourselves.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the media pick this up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, we had help. The media was very receptive to what we said. The
                    old style of USIA, the USIA that existed when I joined, was an organization that
                    as far as its press relations, and in a sense its cultural relations, dealt with
                    the economics of media poverty. It was easy to place the wireless file in little
                    newspapers that couldn't afford a wire service and had no sources of
                    international news. That worked fine for us through the '50s and '60s. The
                    trouble is, it began to not work for us as conditions improved around the world,
                    particularly in Latin America, where there was already a tradition of fairly
                    prosperous big family owned newspapers. What I had figured out in Argentina and
                    Brazil was that the only way you could get any attention from the big papers was
                    to make sure that you were the source for what the U.S. government was saying.
                    Not ersatz wire service stories, but the raw materials, the text, the official
                    statements. What I tried to do in Equador is what I tried elsewhere - to be the
                    source for what the U.S. government is up to and not spend so much time trying
                    to convince them of the virtues of U.S. society. A lot of Latin Americans
                    believed in those virtues anyway.</p>
                <p>I think also, there had been a big change after the Vietnam War. Before the
                    Vietnam War, many of the people we most worried about trusted the U.S.
                    government but did not trust U.S. society, it was too disorderly, too
                    democratic, too vulgar, or whatever. After the Vietnam War you had a different
                    dynamic, where people on the moderate left often tended to trust U.S. society.
                    They didn't trust the U.S. government. Therefore, the problem became the
                    government. So you had two levels. You speak for the government because that is
                    where the problem is; and you provide the raw materials of journalisthe things
                    the government is sayinbecause that's what the best journalists want from you.
                    So finding out what the State Department spokesman had said was difficult to do
                    but very important. Paying a lot of attention to speeches that came across on
                    the wire, the secretary of State, the president, or whoever, getting them out to
                    people quickly. Pointing out the sections where it was relevant to the local
                    situation. You can't always count on a busy editor to read an entire speech,
                    every now and then you have to highlight the relevant parts and get it to him.
                    Get the ambassador to do his own versions of things the government is saying, to
                    restate the proposition in his words. Getting journalists to see the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about person to person relations with the United
                        States? I'm thinking of Ecuadorian students going to the United States and
                        studying, and others on a visitors program. Were the Ecuadorians pretty well
                        plugged into the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, they were. In the first place, they were not very far away.
                    Second, as the New York Times had pointed out many years before I went to
                    Equador, Miami had become the capital of Latin America. It was like Buenos Aires
                    or Rio had been to an earlier generation - the places you had to visit every now
                    and then if you had money and wanted to stay ahead of the game.</p>
                <p>There were a whole lot of old school connections in Equador, people who had gone
                    to universities or graduate school in the United States. Hurtado had been partly
                    educated in the United States. Febres Cordero, the new president, had been
                    educated in a small college in the United States. Many people in both of their
                    cabinets had studies in the U.S. I am a big believer in those educational
                    exchange programs because they make a whale of a difference. Not only in
                    politics but in commerce too. A person who has studied his discipline, whether
                    its medicine, engineering, or computer science, in the United States, has a
                    predisposition to buy American.</p>
                <p>That brings me to the Fulbright Program. We had an active Fulbright Program in
                    Equador. Equador is what is known in the educational exchange trade as a
                    commission country. That means there is a bilateral agreement that governs the
                    functioning of the Fulbright Program in that country, through a binational board
                    of directors that meets and makes decisions on the awarding of scholarships. In
                    most countries, the Fulbright commission also serves as an educational advising
                    office, which is helpful because an Ecuadorian who does not come from a rich
                    family that already has a tradition of studying in the United States, who may be
                    the first person in his family to want to study in the United States, needs
                    help; he needs a place where he can go and figure out how it works in the United
                    States. He needs a place that has university catalogues; he may need help in
                    filling out forms; he needs advice on financial aid. All sorts of things. The
                    Fulbright commission in Equador did that. They maintained their own offices and
                    had a lot of kids who got advice on how to get to the States to study. I don't
                    think it is possible to overestimate how important that is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a pretty good cadre when you arrived and did you
                        continue to cultivate the people who had the American experience in the
                        upper circles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, but it had to be handled with care. That is a very subtle
                    relationship. How do I describe it? A person who has studied in the United
                    States, comes home and takes a governmental position, must constantly show that
                    he has not sold out to the Americans. This means he has to be handled by the
                    American Embassy with patience and a certain amount of subtlety, otherwise we
                    are going to burn him. Some colleagues may be suspicious. It is an attitude that
                    says “Well, yes, he studied in the United States; he goes and sees those
                    Americans all the time and God knows what he is telling them. God only knows
                    whether he is going to sell us out to those foreigners.” That is an attitude
                    that is encouraged by people that did not study in the United States or people
                    who may owe their allegiance more to European political influences.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>The United States political and cultural influence, as opposed to economic clout,
                    in Latin America is fairly new. I think now most people would say that New York,
                    Miami, and Washington are “where it's at.” That was not true until the '60s.
                    Most influential Latin Americans took their political sustenance, did their
                    shopping, and looked for their cultural tastes more to Europe than they did to
                    the United States. That follows traditional immigrant patterns and language, and
                    all sorts of things. You have to remember what a big language island Spanish is.
                    It stretches from Madrid to Manila. So traditionally, most Latin Americans have
                    looked to the Spanish and European political spectrum for their political ideas
                    - rather doctrinaire leftists parties and phalangist right wingers on the
                    extremes whose only common ground had to do with so called dependence on the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>Now dependency theories have gone out of fashion in Latin America. After all,
                    democracy really does rule in Latin America, and I do believe that has to do
                    with the change in how Latin Americans view the United States. It probably does
                    represent a triumph of American foreign policy. Like all triumphs, you have to
                    share the blame and credit with a lot of other influences, but the fact is, for
                    the last ten years or so it has been our goal in Latin America to encourage
                    democracy when we could. It has happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Ronald Reagan perceived? You were there early

                <p>DIETERICH: Of course, he was inaugurated while I was still in Israel. The fact is
                    the Ecuadorian elections produced a president who considered himself very much a

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The elections were in '84, I think. It was the first time I had seen
                    how an embassy handles elections on a more senior level. It seemed to me the
                    embassy's first priority was to figure out who was going to win the elections
                    and that seemed a little silly to me. It was going to be a hard to call
                    election, and all this energy was going into being the first to report election
                    results - a task force, people sitting around in rooms together, and rigging up
                    radios together and all sorts of things - seemed silly in the sense that it was
                    focusing way too much embassy attention on the election, and this worked against
                    our goal that we were neutral in the election. I kept asking myself what we
                    would do? What is the action that flows from this intelligence? Suppose we
                    figure out an hour before the rest of the world that so and so is going to win
                    the election and we report it to Washington, then what happens? The answer is
                    “nothing.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is a self generated test. Sort of showing they
                        are smart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: But to me it is self indulgent and dangerous. When that political
                    officer starts sitting across the desk from somebody and starts interrogating
                    them on what the results of the election are going to be, he may be sending,
                    inadvertently, terrible messages. If there is any advice I used to give
                    political officers when I finally became a DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) it was,
                    “Remember, your questions are somebody else's answers every time. That's not a
                    clever turn of phrase, that is a fact. He is sitting down with you because he
                    wants to know what you are up to. If you sense you are sitting down with
                    somebody who doesn't care what you ask him, find somebody else, because he can't
                    be important - you are wasting your time with him.”</p>
                <p>I was especially disturbed by attempts to organize a pool in the embassy on who
                    was going to win, because I was convinced it would be leaked to the press. If a
                    story leaked about who won the embassy pool, it would take no time at all for a
                    journalist, even a fairly honest journalist, to turn that into an embassy
                    prediction as to who was going to win. The second round of that story would be
                    disastrous for us. Now, I'd like to tell you I talked the embassy out of having
                    a pool, but I didn't. All I could do was not participate in it myself. I think
                    it is a dangerous thing and show offy and self indulgent. The days are long past
                    when the United States would intervene somehow to keep an election from coming
                    out the way it was going to come out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this election, how did we see the issues as far as
                        American interests were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We had not done badly. The main interests were, “Will American
                    investments be treated well? Will they follow our lead on drug issues? Will they
                    behave reasonably on human rights?” We did have a modest AID program in Equador
                    and wondered if we would be able to continue those programs. All these are
                    issues that occupy the thought of foreign service posts throughout Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>The fun of dealing with Latin America is that it really is important to the
                    United States and in ways that are fairly immediate. When Ronald Reagan said all
                    that silly stuff about the tanks rolling into Harlingen, Texas, he obviously
                    didn't know much about Mexico nor much about tanks, and he certainly didn't know
                    much about Nicaragua. But behind that, like a lot of things that Reagan said,
                    was a real truth. What happens in Central America affects Mexico, because Mexico
                    by nature is vulnerable, and what happens in Mexico affects the United States
                    right away. Whether it is drugs going over the border or people going over the
                    border, or sewage spilling into the bay in San Diego, or whatever, what Mexico
                    does really is important to the United States and vice a versa. Our interest in
                    Latin America, and especially in Central Mexico, are not some theory about
                    dominoes, it is stuff that happens every day. Now how did I get off on that
                    tirade?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'll go back to my original question. Did we see any
                        American issues in the elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, we wanted good government and stability, good behavior on human
                    rights, progress toward democracy because if we didn't get those things we
                    couldn't pursue the more down to earth programs we really needed to pursue.
                    Otherwise, our commercial interests, fishing interests off the coast of Equador,
                    even environmental interests in the Galapagos, and the drug issues could not be
                    handled efficiently.</p>
                <p>We wanted the cooperation of Equador to help us stem the transit of drugs out of
                    Bolivia through Equador into Mexico and into the United States. It is in the
                    nature of American politics that if you are going to cooperate with somebody
                    financially, if you are going to help him pay to solve problems that we cause,
                    you have to have a certain level of acceptance on the part of the American body
                    politic, and to get that you have to have a pretty good human rights record and
                    you have to have a reasonably democratic political system, and you've got to
                    have a military that is efficient but under civilian control. Those are issues
                    upon which we can't very well compromise. Oh yes, and you don't beat up on
                    religious folks. Those were our interests.</p>
                <p>We were not particularly worried that either new government would be opposed to
                    those interests. So we could look at that election in a fairly relaxed way
                    because neither side was going to do great damage to our interests. What we
                    wanted to see was a clean process. We pretty much got it. This was a little bit
                    before the great armies of election observers and things like that. Febres
                    Cordero won it fair and square and this represented one of those periodic sea
                    changes in Ecuadorian politics where the center of power moved to Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a problem of the type you saw in Rome, where
                        you sort of hop back and forth and make sure people weren't picking up the
                        snobbery of Quito versus Guayaquil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely. I had a branch USIS post, at Quito, at the consulate in
                    Guayaquil. It was never very well staffed, to tell you the truth. I had to go to
                    Guayaquil often, but I liked it and didn't mind going there. My experience in
                    Santa Cruz, Bolivia sort of helped. I don't mind what the Latin Americans refer
                    to rather disdainfully as “tropicalismo” - I kind of like tropicalismo and feel
                    very comfortable with it.</p>
                <p>I suppose it was a problem, and I don't think it affected our relationship with
                    Febres Cordero. No matter how much you do on it, the Guayaquil people will say
                    that the embassy doesn't do enough in Guayaquil.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>Besides I had to be careful with time and resources. We had an old tradition of
                    working in the city of Cuenca. Cuenca is down to the south, very much in the
                    mountains, a city of great charm but tremendous isolation. I don't think there
                    was a road into Cuenca until the 1960s. I remember going to the cultural center,
                    being shown an old piano and being told “We are proud of the piano because it
                    came up on the back of a mule.” It must have been one hell of a mule. Cuenca was
                    this very old, very traditional city that always felt neglected. But they felt
                    they had very strong cultural traditions and the cultural attach?, or head of
                    USIS should pay much more attention to Cuenca than we ever did.</p>
                <p>One of the tricks you use, and we used this in Mexico also, is when you have a
                    Fulbright Commission meeting, quarterly meeting, you have it in another city.
                    You would be amazed how important you can make the Fulbright Commission look
                    when you are out of the capitals. In most of those towns and cities, the city
                    fathers would turn out to greet us and put on entertainments and dinners, and
                    everything else. So we did regional stuff. I even remember going down to see the
                    oil fields in the jungles of Equador.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Febres Cordero won. I guess he was convinced that Hart's embassy wasn't
                    the embassy he wanted to work with. I guess he thought we had been too close to
                    Hurtado, but you know, that's that old dilemma in the foreign service. Of course
                    we had been close to Hurtado, he was the government and an interesting person,
                    who was seen as a progressive you could work with. He was well respected in the
                    rest of Latin America, so there was every reason in the world why we should have
                    had a close relationship with him. I thought we had done fairly well in reaching
                    out to the opposition. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying it was a new government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, Febres Cordero may have thought “Hey, it's a new government, I
                    won, a new party, I'm from Guayaquil. The least the Americans can do is send a
                    new ambassador.” We may see that as undesirable, but I have a feeling a lot of
                    Latin American politicians see it as sort of a logical thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred Rondon came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, Fred Rondon came in. Sam Hart left, I think rather unhappy. I had
                    known Fred for quite awhile, and it was fun to have an ambassador about my age.
                    I had worked with him before as a colleague in Washington. Until I went to
                    Equador ambassadors had been rather Godlike, distant figures, and all of a
                    sudden ambassadors were persons I had grown up in the service with.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Rondon operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think he was in a pretty ideal position, and his first job was to
                    solidify his relationship with the Febres Cordero government. This he did pretty
                    well. It was right after the elections, so reaching out to the opposition wasn't
                    a really high priority at that point. You would still have time to do that, the
                    opposition is licking its wounds anyway, and most likely will reorganize itself.
                    The human rights situation wasn't bad. We weren't in a human rights violating
                    country, so you didn't have the concern of, “Gee are we being nice enough to the
                    dissidents?” When it came to reaching out to Indians, I just don't think we knew
                    how to do it.</p>
                <p>Equador is a small country, but it is really a big country. There is a whole lot
                    of countryside area out to the east, going down into the jungles, that we don't
                    know much about, and there aren't very many towns down there. That is where a
                    lot of folks live, but we don't have much contact with them. Every now and then
                    they get mad and come roaring into Quito and raise hell. Then they go home. That
                    is what happened in this last coup. The problem is, they go home, and there is
                    almost no way to get a handle on the political organization because there is no
                    place to go. If you send a political officer down - where does he go? Where does
                    he paddle his canoe? Ambassador Rondon did a good job in getting in tight with
                    Febres Cordero. I think Febres liked him. I don't remember big problems coming
                    up, but I do remember doing a lot of work on drug stuff.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It is always an issue, but I talked about the map and Equador being a
                    big country. An Ecuadorian map would show it being a lot bigger than it would be
                    on our map. There were a couple of dustups down on the frontier in the 1940s,
                    and the United States is one of the guarantors...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We are one of the guarantors, along with Brazil and Venezuela, so we
                    have a role to play. I can remember that there was a dustup and some shooting
                    back and forth. Military attaches went down and looked at it and we made
                    recommendations. But our recommendations were always the same. We think the
                    parties should get together and solve the problem. Well, gee! There's a ringing
                    policy to hang your hat on!</p>

                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: We'll guarantee that we will have the same policy. I don't remember
                    much coming from that. The trouble is, it is a source of instability, and when a
                    dustup occurs you get people on the right in both countries, and people within
                    the military in both countries who see that as an opportunity to attack the
                    government. They then say, “Dammit, we didn't do what we were supposed to do. We
                    should have been a whole lot tougher and we weren't tough because the president
                    isn't tough.” That stuff really works because they believe it. Just like there
                    are people in this country who think we ought to be a lot tougher than we often
                    are on certain issues because they aren't running things. That led to the Vargas
                    affair and what was a coup attempt.</p>
                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about what the Vargas affair was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Frank Vargas was an Air Force General and an inveterate coup plotter.
                    I first met him at a Marine Corps Ball, because my information officer was
                    dating an officer in the MIL group who was known for his bad judgment. He took
                    it upon himself, without clearing it with anybody, to invite Frank Vargas as his
                    guest to the Marine Corps Ball. I ended up sitting at a table with them. I
                    realized Vargas should not have been invited. Everybody knew who he was, and it
                    looked like we were being nice to Frank Vargas. Frank, by the way, wasn't a
                    nickname, he was named “Frank” and there were American connections in his
                    family, but I'm not sure what they were. He did speak English very well. You
                    know, a swaggering macho type military officer.</p>
                <p>The details are a little foggy now. He tried something of a coup nature but it
                    didn't work, and Febres Cordero had him arrested and thrown in the clink. Then
                    days later Febres Cordero flew down to the air force base outside Guayaquil, and
                    was himself taken hostage by the air force. They said he had to release Frank
                    Vargas. Then there was an attempt of a semi takeover of the military portion of
                    the airport in Quito also. We got pretty worried and there were the usual phone
                    calls back and fortU.S. military to their military, and others saying, “Bring
                    this to a halt, it is no good.” an“If you do this, you will never get one more
                    cent of U.S. military aid and we won't sell you anything.” Basically, it worked.
                    Febres Cordero was released and Frank Vargas was put on a plane and escorted out
                    of the country. Nobody got hurt, but it shook Febres Cordero. I think he felt we
                    had done pretty much what we ought to have done but he was never as secure in
                    his presidency after that.</p>

                        Indian revolt, then the military came in and within three days after phone
                        calls of this nature, they turned the government over to the vice president.
                        Was there a feeling of, “Gee, we can't go too far because the Americans are
                        giving our military all this aid and if we mess around they will call it
                        off?” In a way, this creates a dependency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We control their stuff. Well, that's good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time, it means a mindset. From our point of
                        view, and the people's point of view, it's probably not bad. It means you
                        are not going to have military coups coming one after the other which are
                        not for the benefit of the people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: If I could make the trade where people in Latin America believe their
                    military is dependent upon the United States but their economy is not, I would
                    make that trade every time. That's good stuff. That's what happened this month.
                    He proposed to dollarize the economy, which makes a lot of economic sense. I can
                    understand how a person who has been educated at Harvard and has studied some
                    economics might think this was a really great idea. Panama has done well with
                    it.</p>
                <p>The poorest of the poor in Equador said, “Wait a minute, this means prices for
                    everything are going to go up and we are going to be screwed.” They reacted
                    accordingly. Pretty much unable to grasp the idea, to embrace the idea that,
                    “Yes, it will be tough for a while but in the long run we'll all be better off.”
                    It's the old argument - in the long term we are all dead anyway, so this doesn't
                    count. They were joined by junior officers in the military, who are also among
                    the poorest of the poor. They don't get much money either, and if they start
                    looking at a situation where the stuff they buy is going to be four times more
                    expensive, they can't live with that. So they joined the revolt, the president
                    went to ground someplace, and a junta was formed which included a military
                    officer who was sort of the leader of the younger coup types, and he joined with
                    the Indians. Then I think the phone calls started. Then the head of the military
                    replaced the younger man on the junta, then dissolved the junta which had ruled
                    Equador for three hours. That seems ridiculous and that is always very funny,
                    but I've seen that same thing in other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It happened almost in that same way in what was at that
                        time the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We always think it's funny but that is actually fairly normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back now, what about the issue that used to dominate
                        our relations - tuna fishing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Tuna, oh big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the '83 to '86 treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The issue there was one of territorial waters. They claimed a lot more
                    territorial waters than we claimed, but we sort of recognized their right to
                    claim those waters as an economic zone and advised our fishermen, mainly out of
                    San Diego, not to fish in them. We were constantly worried about situations
                    where a U.S. based tuna boat would stray into the Ecuadorian economic fishing
                    zone, and would be apprehended, escorted into Guayaquil, and then it would take
                    a lot of time to get the boat and the people released. Sam Hart worked out a
                    pretty good deal, if I remember it correctly, with the San Diego tuna
                    fishermen's association or somebody, whereby we would work our contacts with the
                    Ecuadorian Navy and get word they were tracking somebody in the water. We would
                    then get on the horn to the tuna fishing association (or whatever it was) in San
                    Diego, and they would get on the radio and say, “You are busted, get out of
                    there. They are on their way to get you.” Everybody was happy with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point, the American tuna fleet was saying “screw
                        you” going into the zone and getting arrested, then getting compensated. We
                        had gone beyond that point by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I guess so. Compensated by the U.S. Government? I guess so. You see,
                    that doesn't really work, because the Ecuadorians (the person doing the
                    capturing) can put that boat out of commission for longer and longer periods of
                    time. That merely creates a motivation for them to lose the papers and keep them
                    locked up in the port by saying it is all in the paper work. The longer they can
                    tie up that tuna boat, the better for them - the worse for the tuna
                    fishermen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you had come there, it was really working at
                        the edges?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were working pragmatically by saying to a government that was
                    willing to hear it, “We don't want these problems, because they aren't helping
                    anybody. So let's make them go away.” That was distinct from some of the tuna
                    problems we have now. That was not the tuna dolphin problem, which is a later
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was not during your time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I had to work with the tuna dolphin problem later in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Galapagos?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, in the first place, I went to Galapagos, and it's a wonderful
                    experience. It showed how nice it is to work in an embassy. Our accredited
                    diplomats are treated as Ecuadorian citizens when it comes to paying for a trip
                    to the Galapagos, which means it's a whole lot cheaper - about one third the
                    cost. So my wife, daughter, and son (he was just a little tike at that point)
                    all took a cruise to the Galapagos. We sailed out on a ship that took about 90
                    people, a small North Sea passenger vessel, and spent about six or seven days
                    touring the Galapagos, then flew back. They have this great routine where you
                    pull up to a nice site in the morning, have your breakfast, then load into a
                    motorized whaleboat to go ashore. You look at whatever beast is on that island,
                    wander around, load back up and go back to the ship for lunch and a siesta. In
                    the meantime, they have cruised to someplace else and take you ashore once again
                    to another location. It was absolutely charming, and we had a particularly good
                    trip.</p>
                <p>We had booked late and were assigned a cabin down below the waterline, an
                    undesirable cabin. When we went aboard I noticed this man I had met someplace
                    before, went up and said hello. It turned out he was the owner of the ship and I
                    had met him at a reception some place in Guayaquil a few weeks before. I think
                    he was an American, but a longtime resident of Equador, and he asked where we
                    were staying and then said, “That's not good enough for somebody from the
                    embassy, take my cabin.” His cabin was a virtual motel room right behind the
                    bridge.</p>
                <p>The Ecuadorians do a really good job in the Galapagos. They are extremely serious
                    about avoiding ecological damage to this very special place, and they control
                    who goes there. It appears to be very successfully controlled access, and the
                    behavior of people is also controlled. The guides were young Ecuadorians, and
                    some foreigners, who knew what they were talking about and would jump all over
                    you if you dropped a candy wrapper or something on one of the islands or did
                    something you shouldn't do. There are a couple of small settlements where people
                    are doing light agriculture on a couple of the islands, just enough to maintain
                    an Ecuadorian presence there.</p>
                <p>I also got involved with Bill Buckley. He called the embassy and said he was
                    coming down. Remember, he did those sailing books for awhile. He chartered a
                    yacht called the Sealestial out of the east coast of the United States. He was
                    flying down to Guayaquil and the yacht was sailing down; he was going to join
                    the yacht at Guayaquil and go out to the Galapagos. He asked us to make sure
                    Sealestial had permission to visit the Galapagos. I got the action on it because
                    he was a journalist, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Buckley was quite a famous conservative journalist
                        and well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: We talked with the Ecuadorian Navy and made sure everything was all
                    set, then I went to Guayaquil and met him at the plane. We had a nice evening
                    together, mainly talking about sailing, then he went out and had a nice cruise
                    around the Galapagos, came back, and we talked him into coming up to Quito, just
                    because it was a nice place to stay and Sam Hart wanted to meet him. We spent an
                    evening at the residence and the next day we toured churches in Quito. The worst
                    thing he ever said to me was, “You know, we really had a good time out there in
                    the Galapagos, you should have come with us.” I thought, “WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
                    ASK ME?” That was after I had been there anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other issues we should cover in this '83 to
                        '86 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I guess not. Personnel issues were hard. I don't know whether you want
                    to get into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you go into it a little.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Remember, I lost my information officer because she decided to get
                    married and go off with the military attach?, the same dope that had invited
                    Frank Vargas to the Marine Ball, and the agency told me they couldn't get me
                    anybody. I was also told I couldn't get a secretary, we still had an American
                    secretary to help us with classified stuff in those days, and they couldn't do
                    that either. I stumbled across hiring spouses before it became very fashionable
                    to do it, so I hired a spouse to act as a secretary, which worked out well. Then
                    I hired a spouse to be my acting information officer. She was a lady who had
                    some passing experience with the press, I trained her for the job and she got
                    pretty well at it. We also worked out a deal whereby the Fulbright Commission
                    would share some spaces with AID, which resulted in some money being saved.</p>
                <p>AID had an academic scholarship program and we were able t combine the
                    educational advising service into one operation. I was kind of proud of that,
                    but one of my successors killed the whole thing because he said it was more
                    trouble than it was worth. It seemed to me that for the customer to do one stop
                    shopping was a good idea, and what we didn't want was to have people who wanted
                    a scholarship shopping around among USIS, AID and even the MIL group at times. I
                    made an attempt to put it all together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '86, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In '86 I was asked by the then USIA area director to come back as her
                    deputy in the Latin America office in USIA Washington. I was happy to do that,
                    so in the summer of '86 we came back here.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>Q: You were doing this from '86 until when?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Until '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The deputy director is the alter ego or the number two for the
                    director, but it has a lot to do with personnel management, getting people
                    assigned to places. It has to do with liaison with the State Department and
                    other government agencies. You write a hell of a lot of OERs (Office Efficiency
                    Reports). Also there are a lot of budgetary issues. It had to do with the
                    management of posts throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and required a
                    lot of training and travel. It was incumbent on the director and the deputy
                    director to make sure they visited every post once a year in order to write a
                    more credible efficiency report on the PAOs involved. That was a complicated
                    process. Remember in the old system, PAOs got at least two efficiency reports
                    every cycle, one from the ambassador and one from the area director. Like any
                    headquarters office, we were charged with personnel, budget, supervision and
                    fire fighting. Also, we represented Latin American interests to the executive
                    office of USIA, Charlie Wick was director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk a bit about your impression, during the '86
                        to '89 period, of Charlie Wick, as director of USIA. He was quite a strong
                        personality, a friend of Ronald Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Charlie Wick took a whole lot of heat early in his tenure. The agency
                    was really down on him. He said things he shouldn't have every now and then.
                    There were all sorts of jokes and graffiti around. He was picky; he was trying
                    to impose a sort of conservative Reaganite agenda on USIA, and it wasn't good
                    for USIA. USIA is a fairly liberal group anyway. USIA started out in 1953
                    recruiting people out of academia and the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>My experience with Wick was somewhat different. He had learned a lot. He had been
                    burned now and then in the press and he had gotten more accustomed to the
                    bureaucracy, and more secure in his own leadership of USIA. He had a lot of
                    success in terms of funding that sort of endeared him to people at USIA.
                    Whatever you say about Wick, we got the money and we have clout at the White
                    House. I found him pleasant to deal with. I didn't find him particularly
                    difficult, and I also found that I didn't like some of the criticism of Charlie
                    Wick. Frankly, I found there was a touch of genteel anti Semitism about some of
                    the attitudes that I didn't like at all. I don't like people getting beaten up
                    because they aren't like us and I don't like people being beaten for style. The
                    trouble with a lot of USIA people at that time was they were too much like the
                    rest of the foreign service, kind of reserved, slightly snobby, and at times not
                    very effective in their snobbism. Plus, I think it is the duty of the federal
                    bureaucracy to reflect the policy priorities of the administration. I know that
                    is annoying to people every now and then, and I know some people see it as
                    requiring them to violate their principles. But I think there is a principle of
                    democracy that says the people that win the election get to call the policy. It
                    is the principle I follow, and it is the duty of foreign service people to
                    implement those policies to the best of their ability.</p>
                <p>Charlie Wick will be remembered most in USIA for having done what he did with
                    television; for inventing World Net. Now it is going to be easy to forget,
                    because of integration of USIA into the State Department and because World Net
                    is already kind of pass?. To Charlie's credit, he got us into World Net when it
                    wasn't yet pass?, when real time transmission by satellite really meant
                    something. There were times, not always, when it worked pretty damn well. When
                    we could take a group of journalists, put them in a room, and let them have a
                    background session with an assistant secretary of state, or a deputy assistant
                    secretary, or some cabinet level official. That was creating electronically for
                    them an experience they weren't going to get any other way. They didn't have a
                    chance in hell of making everything come together so they could get to
                    Washington and interview this person one on one. I thought that was perfectly
                    good press work, and I thought it was a creative use of technology.</p>
                <p>I don't know whether you read Peter Galbraith's critique in the Foreign Service
                    Journal a few weeks ago of having disastrous election coverage through World Net
                    because it wasn't very timely. That was the kind of thing where we could never
                    competUSIA did not have the resources to be better than CNN. But when it came to
                    putting responsible journalists or responsible leaders with their counterparts
                    in the United States without requiring a whole lot of travel, World Net did that
                    very well. It saved time and money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in '89, did you feel that USIA was a pretty
                        strong agency and doing the right things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: After a year as deputy I became the area director, which gave me more
                    access. The answer is no, I didn't feel the USIA was a very strong agency. There
                    were already a lot of problems. I could talk about this for quite awhile. Maybe
                    it is something you would want to talk about, and it is a hard topic, because we
                    are still in the period of integrating USIA with State, and still in a period
                    where a lot of my colleagues, especially the ones in the USIA alumni Association
                    of which I am the president, are grieving the loss of an agency in which they
                    spent their careers. Those who are grieving the hardest are those who were there
                    close to the beginning. You have to remember the reason for having a USIA had to
                    do with very strongly held ideological opinions about why the State Department
                    couldn't be trusted with public diplomacy. Those earlier USIS officers really
                    believed this. By the time I was working in USIA some of us had already
                    recognized that it was a hell of a lot easier to do your job if you worked out
                    of the embassy instead of in your own offices or someplace else.</p>
                <p>But if you looked at an earlier generation of USIA officers, they had an opposite
                    view. USIA had to have its separate quarters in order to distinguish itself from
                    the embassy, and that USIA's job was a very different kind of diplomacy, a very
                    educational kind of function that could only be done if you had your own turf
                    and that should not be contaminated by the day to day narrow policy
                    considerations of the embassy. But at the same time most PAOs in the field were
                    beginning to figure out that they really did owe something to the ambassador.
                    But it was often kind of standoffish relationship, but PAOs were probably models
                    of cooperation compared to their counterparts heading up AID missions, Milgroups
                    and CIA stations.</p>
                <p>I guess things got better with the Kennedy administration, when the “country
                    team” concept was initiated. It basically said that all U.S. government agencies
                    in a given country were under the direction of the American ambassador. It did
                    not address the fact that those same agencies got their funding from
                    bureaucracies in Washington that did not report to the Secretary of State. Now
                    the theory is that ambassadors represent the president and not the Secretary of
                    State but the fact of the matter is that almost all ambassadors get their
                    marching orders through a regional assistant secretary. So there really was a
                    disconnect.</p>
                <p>I think most people from other agencies thought the country team notion was a
                    good deal for ambassadors. I don't really see it that way. I may have been
                    somewhat of a good deal for the State Department, k it was less of a bargain fro
                    ambassadors. What the Kennedy administration had really said to ambassadors was,
                    “We are now going to hold you responsible for activities over which you don't
                    have sufficient control?” That's being delegated responsibility without
                    authority. That's what they tell every ensign in the navy to never do, but
                    ambassadors got stuck with it.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>As I said before, some of us began to believe that it was easier to do the job
                    well when you worked out of an embassy. On the press and information side, we
                    began to learn that U.S. policy itself is what is interesting to the most
                    important news organizations, and what we are seen as being a credible source
                    of. It is with policy materials that we have an advantage over the wire services
                    and international radio and television. It is what we have that other sources
                    don't have.</p>
                <p>On the cultural side of USIS, more and more people began to get into the act.
                    More people could afford to study in the U.S. on their own and more
                    organizations, including universities themselves, were running exchange programs
                    and offering scholarships. As economies improved in Europe, the Far East and
                    Latin America, major U.S. cultural attractions were touring with very little or
                    no help form the U.S. government, and in the very poor nations we didn't have
                    enough money to help anyway. But we did learn that some of government programs,
                    like the Fulbright scholarships, had prestige because they were government
                    programs. In many countries, the involvement of the U.S. embassy in a particular
                    program added prestige to a program rather than making it less credible.
                    Sometimes Americans have a hard time believing that governments have prestige
                    programs. We need to remember that in most of the world, for example, the
                    prestige universities are the government ones, not the private.</p>
                <p>So we were beginning to learn to use our governmental nature as an advantage and
                    to identify ourselves with U.S. diplomacy rather than to distance ourselves from
                    it as had been traditional with USIS.</p>
                <p>As the media and as the academic world began to become more international, as
                    newspapers around the world began subscribe on own to wire services, as general
                    levels of prosperity meant increased travel, and academic interchange was going
                    to happen anyway, we were left without the central role we had in the years
                    after the war and the early years of the cold war. We had traded on the
                    economics of poverty for a long time, but it became clear to me in the '70s that
                    we couldn't do that anymore. If we continued to do that, we were going to be
                    irrelevant and we had to find alternatives. To me, the alternative was becoming
                    an impeccable and lightning fast source of policy information and of trading on
                    the prestige of our exchange programs. To Charlie Wick, the alternative was to
                    get again on the cutting edge of technology, and he jumped on the early
                    television stuff. He recreated the advantage we had held before when the
                    wireless file was the only wire service in town. We were the only direct
                    satellite feed in town for about ten years, which worked well for us.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>In the meantime, academic exchange was doing pretty well in the sense there was
                    more and more of a market for it. More and more U.S. universities, instead of
                    taking a few foreign students as a matter of duty, suddenly realized there was a
                    whole market out there and we want part of this pie. We want foreign students
                    because they represent a resource. We want Fulbrighters because that is
                    prestige. USIA still had a central position in sort of being the broker, the
                    people who could most efficiently help you find some students for a university,
                    or help you locate your professor teaching in some other university, because
                    that was also good for you. They were the key to the Fulbright process and the
                    key to a lot of other educational exchange processes. Our cultural affairs
                    officers, who have often been dismissed as persons who will bring in “nose
                    flute' players, in fact were playing a very key role in educational exchange.
                    That is money, big bucks.</p>
                <p>I have spoken to trade missions and successfully said, “Get your state university
                    to offer some scholarships. That's investment; that's a loss leader. Get a few
                    people from this country into your state university and, believe me, they will
                    bring others with them.” I could see in El Salvador that there was a whole club
                    of people who had gone to Louisiana State.</p>
                <p>My experience as area director for USIA taught me a couple of things. One thing,
                    I didn't think the agency was very healthy. I thought we were losing the
                    technological battle in ways that couldn't be recouped. I thought the Voice of
                    America was so far out of it and so basically institutionally crazy that they
                    were going to be no help at all. Remember, the Voice was about one third, almost
                    one half of the resources of the agency. I sat on a committee, which was the
                    modernization committee, and you could NOT talk those people out of short wave
                    radio broadcasts, no matter what.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who listens to short wave radio anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not very many people in LatiAmerica. I think there were two kinds of
                    people who listened regularly to short wave. First there were DXerthat is short
                    wave hobbyists more interested in how many stations they could get than any kind
                    of content. Second there were old right wingers who thought it was kind of a
                    duty to listen to the Voice. They were holdovers from U.S. policy in the
                    fifties. Neither of those groups fit within any target audience I could
                    identify, and neither of them had any particular influence in the politics of
                    their country. So, as far a short wave audiences were concerned, the Voice was
                    totally out of it, at least in Latin America.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>Where we could stay in it was by placing Voice of America materials on local
                    stations, because if you don't get into drive time in any city in the world, you
                    aren't on the radio anymore. That's what radio is for. That's what you do when
                    you are driving in a car. If you are a fanatic, that is what you do when you eat
                    breakfast. So what we kept trying to do was to make it easier for a local
                    station to take VOA and use it as or in its prime time news broadcasts. There
                    were always a few that did in every country. But not the biggies. For instance,
                    the Latin America Division of the Voice, the news service, would support us on
                    this because they wanted the audience, but the engineering division hated it
                    because all they wanted was short wave, and the higher ups felt that placing
                    things on other stations could compromise their reputation for objectivity, and
                    could compromise the Voice's reputation for real journalism. If you wanted to
                    get into the soul of the news room of the Voice of America, you were dealing
                    with a bunch of persons whose worst nightmare was that they would snubbed by the
                    New York Times person at a cocktail party; that they would not be seen as real
                    journalists, which by the way they were. I have no criticism of the quality of
                    the VOA news broadcasters, they are damn good. They were sounding like NPR
                    before NPR sounded like NPR. But they had a big inferiority complex which they
                    bolstered by being super partisans of press freedom.</p>
                <p>I came to the conclusion that the Voice was out of it, except perhaps in denied
                    areas like China. When they failed to take over television and let the rest of
                    the agency take it over, when nobody ever said we need Voice of America
                    television, I knew they weren't serious. I realized the engineering division,
                    who I had worked for early in my career, had really made a career choice which
                    was nerdiness to the ultimate degree, “We would rather be the world's greatest
                    short wave broadcasters than relevant.” In the meantime, I saw the department
                    becoming more and more aware of public affairs and getting better at it. This is
                    something you often didn't say in USIA, because if you said “the department is
                    getting better at public affairs” (which was true), the official ideology of
                    USIA was, “No that can't be, because if that is true, what are we doing
                    here?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Department of State's spokesman has become more and
                        more the bell ringer. This is where your news is often made.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, it is where the news is often made, and the secret is, policy is
                    often made in the process of press guidance and speech writing. That is where
                    policy is made because on certain issues - often by accident - because it is
                    where the department is often forced to take a stand on issues it would rather
                    avoid.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>Well, at any rate I could see changes, maybe because of pretty good work at a lot
                    of USIS posts and a lot of embassies over the years, where ambassadors were
                    increasingly aware of the fact that the press really counted and was important -
                    that it was very difficult to do your job in a particular country if the press
                    was hostile to you. It seemed to me there was an evolving situation in the
                    department. At the beginning of my career, it seemed the attitude was, “Public
                    affairs is not important. If we don't do it, it can't be important, therefore to
                    hell with it.” But another mindset began to show itself in the Latin American
                    Bureau with the Central America problems of the mid '80s. That was a sort of
                    silver bullet mentality. Somehow there was some kind of magic in public affairs
                    that would make flawed policy work if you just made the right videotape or
                    pamphlet.</p>
                <p>That attitude was almost more troublesome than the earlier attitude of, “We would
                    just as soon ignore it.” A lot of it was naive. The trouble with that naivet?
                    was that it worked into the naivet? of some people in USIA also, so that if you
                    had a deputy assistant secretary of State saying, “Let's make a videotape to
                    tell the truth about Nicaragua,” you would have a bunch of persons in the
                    television and motion picture division that would say, “Yes sir, we can do that,
                    we make those all the time.” Of course, no videotape was going to change what
                    people thought about Nicaragua, so I found myself in the uncomfortable position
                    of being the person that says, “No, that won't work.” I knew a lot of those high
                    flown schemes and white papers were not only not going to work, but were also
                    going to have a negative impact. They would reflect badly on the department and
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>I also grew increasingly pessimistic about USIA's ability to influence policy.
                    One of the stories that every USIA officer knows was when Ed Murrow said, “We
                    have to be in on the takeoffs as well as the crash landings.” That is absolutely
                    true. Anybody who makes a policy and doesn't think about public affairs at the
                    beginning is a fool. Secrecy doesn't really work and the end of policy is almost
                    always public. If it isn't public, it was probably a bad policy and won't make
                    any difference anyway. But you better have people thinking at the beginning
                    about how it's going to play at the end, because the worst disaster in diplomacy
                    is an agreement negotiated with a country which won't fly because the people in
                    that country hate it. It produces a reputation of failure for the department
                    within the U.S. government, and it produces a sense of betrayal in the country
                    we were trying to influence.</p>
                <p>Q: Something I learned at the beginning was, “There is no such thing as a
                    diplomatic victory.” This implies your side has put something over on the other
                    side. Of course diplomacy continues, so a victory means you have put something
                    over which means it is going to sour relations the next time it comes up.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's right. Why would you ask somebody to do something you wouldn't
                    or can't do, unless you are out to get him? I came out of my experience in the
                    headquarters of USIA somewhat pessimistic about the future. That view left you
                    no place to go except back to an embassy.</p>

                <p>Charlie Wick had access to the president, but he didn't have any great influence
                    on policy because he didn't think much about policy. That wasn't his thing.
                    Charlie's thing was technique, funding, and producing. He was a producer, and a
                    good one, but he was not a man who thought a lot about policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told that he had a very short attention span and that
                        people who dealt with him made a point of having charts and going in with
                        five sentence presentations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The world is led by people with short attention spans. In defense of
                    Charlie Wick, I'm not at all sure his reputation for not paying attention and
                    doing whatever he wanted to do was really deserved. I accompanied him on a visit
                    to Mexico. People has said to me, “Oh boy, you're going to hate that, it's going
                    to be awful.” That reputation certainly didn't show in Mexico. He was absolutely
                    perfect, charming, and stuck to the script. He said what he was supposed to say;
                    he was patient, he listened, and he was quite charming. I sat in a meeting with
                    Charlie Wick and Bernardo Sepulveda, the foreign minister of Mexico, and if you
                    know Bernardo Sepulveda at all, you can't imagine two more opposite characters
                    in their approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sepulveda was not a great friend of the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, he wasn't, he was very Europeanized, but Charlie Wick and he just
                    went at it, they had a wonderful hour and a half conversation. I'm not sure they
                    actually understood each other, but it went very nicely.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I thought the mission, in a sense, was beginning to evaporate within the
                    U.S. government in ways we didn't have much control over. We could not regain
                    control of technology; that was lost to us. We could not slow down the flow of
                    information in the world. We could not have a great influence on policy because
                    we weren't big enough. Some of those factors, whether USIA liked it or not,
                    argued for the consolidation of USIA and the department. If people with public
                    affairs expertise need to be in at the takeoff you have to do it in the
                    department. The theory at USIA was that if you got on the NSC (National Security
                    Council), if you got into NSC meetings, then you could influence policy. I'm
                    probably wrong, but the theory I developed was that the NSC doesn't really work
                    very well. You have to remember when I was there in Washington. It was Ollie
                    North time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's personality driven in the NSC.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well the NSC is supposed to be a coordinating mechanism, but I don't
                    think it coordinates very well. Out of frustration at not being able to
                    coordinate very well, it occasionally conceives its own policy and becomes its
                    own agency, which is what happened in Central America during the Reagan
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Coordination really is difficult. I sat in on a lot of interagency meetings
                    during my time at USIA, and came to realize how unproductive they can be.
                    Everybody gets together in a big room at the department with a principal
                    representative of each agency and a couple of other people from that agency
                    sitting behind him against the wall. Then you go around the table, every
                    representative sets out a ritualized position, and very little negotiation takes
                    place because the people sitting there have the two outriders behind them, one
                    of whom is going to tell on him when they go back to their agency.</p>
                <p>So the mechanism doesn't really work well. That means the only effective
                    coordinating mechanism in the US foreign affairs establishment is the country
                    team at an embassy overseas. There you sit down with people who know each other
                    well, without folks sitting behind. The people at the table have some resources
                    in their hands and are authorized to horse trade. This sometimes works well at
                    least at the country level, but it may account for a certain bilateral
                    inclination in our policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing I haven't asked you about. You were in USIA
                        headquarters during the surfacing of the Iran Contra affair weren't you? Did
                        that have any effect on you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure. It is one of those events that I can remember where I was when
                    it surfaced. I was at the department in the Latin America Bureau with people who
                    were involved in the whole thing. There was a stunned reaction at the
                    department. How do you deal with things like that?</p>
                <p>What you do in a case like Iran Contra, from the USIA's point of view, is what
                    you did at Watergate. You explain the process. You no longer can defend the
                    people. There are two jobs: first, you explain the process ad nauseam and you
                    find ways to say “the policy is still a good idea anyway even though these
                    people really screwed it up in their zeal. And the screw up will be dealt with
                    by the process.” Secondly, you point out that the basic policy is still a good
                    idea, given of course that the policy survives the scandal. In the case of Iran
                    Contra that meant saying that the United States would continue to support those
                    people opposed to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and why.</p>
                <p>Those are the two things you can do. I'm not sure how effective they are but it
                    does help to explain the process and I think with both Watergate and Iran
                    Contra, the process ended up being rather admired overseas. People liked it.
                    They thought, “That wouldn't happen in my country,” but a lot of people thought
                    it might be nice if it did.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>As the USIA person, I spent a lot of time in the department in those days, so I
                    knew the principal players in all this stuff, including the political
                    appointees. It was a rough time. Ollie North's excessive zeal was not a surprise
                    but there was some “oh, shit, it finally happened” reaction and almost a feeling
                    that it had to happen because there were too many people in the process who were
                    willing to salute and go ahead and carry out a bad idea that appeared to be good
                    in the short term but was obviously stupid in the long term. There were too many
                    people who didn't think there was a long term. In diplomacy there is always a
                    long term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't this one of the problems of almost everybody from
                        the professional, but certainly from the political side, that most people
                        are in a job for the short term?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That is true and it means you have to have some principles somehow.
                    Those things we call principles - a certain regard for truth, and human rights,
                    for example - are also very pragmatic stuff, because you have to be there when
                    the current crisis is all over. The long term isn't that far away. If we
                    overthrew the Sandinistas, what would replace them? I think the fact that we
                    really didn't overthrow them was probably a good thing for Nicaragua, because
                    eventually you had an electoral process. I know the fact that we didn't
                    overthrow anybody in El Salvador, despite all the money over those many years,
                    ended up being good for El Salvador. It is fairly easy to overthrow a stupid
                    authoritarian government. What is hard is to get something to replace it. We
                    proved that in Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point and we will pick this up

                <p>DIETERICH: From '89 to '92.</p>

                <p>Today is the 15th of February 2000. Jeff, in 1989 you are off to El Salvador. You
                    are there from '89 to '92 - what was your job and who was your ambassador at
                    that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I went there as the deputy chief of missions, on loan to the
                    department from USIA. As I was winding up my tour in USIA as area director for
                    Latin America, my old friend Bill Walker, who had been the DAS for Central
                    America, came over for lunch. We had served together in Okinawa in the '60s,
                    when he was a vice consul in the consular unit in Naha and I was the executive
                    officer of the Okinawa relay station of the Voice. We went to lunch and he asked
                    me if I would consider being DCM and I said I would think about it. We talked
                    about where things were going in El Salvador. I wasn't particularly interested
                    in going to El Salvador and helping to preside over a slogging kind of guerilla
                    war, in which we were major funders, for three more years. Bill and I both felt
                    that some kind of peace agreement, and a peace agreement favored by U.S. policy,
                    was in the offing. It was an interesting illustration of a phenomenon I learned
                    working in public affairs. That is that you need to be very careful of your
                    cover story because it is most likely going to come true. The cover story in the
                    early Reagan administration was, “We're not only there fighting a war against
                    the communists, we are fighting a war in favor of democracy.” That wasn't
                    exactly true when it was said. Our major motivation was the evil empire, as
                    anyone could see. Because we kept talking about democracy and the elements that
                    needed to be in place to make democracy work, by the time of the second Reagan
                    administration, and certainly into the Bush administration, democracy had in
                    fact become the policy. The reason you have to be careful of your cover story is
                    that the press, and other political forces, both national and international,
                    will eventually beat you into coming clean on what you said your policy was.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Walker and I were both convinced that we were into a pro democracy policy
                    and also into a “bring the war to an end” kind of policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the period you are having lunch, this is early
                        '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't remember exactly, but it was probably was late '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Bush was in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were well beyond the Iran Contra thing, which had put in some
                    elements of change in the Central America policy. There was another cover story
                    there that we had to come clean on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you seeing that looked promising?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, it is a kind of nice story. As Area Director for Latin America,
                    I used to get invited to a lot of seminars. I got invited to one, which I think
                    was sponsored by Florida International University or the University of Miami,
                    but I think it was FIU. The person in charge called me up and said Freddie
                    Cristiani was going to be there. By that time Cristiani, was president elect of
                    El Salvador. I thought, “This is a wonderful chance to depart from my habit of
                    not going to seminars and get a chance to hear what Cristiani had to say about
                    his plans for El Salvador.” I did go and had some very interesting conversations
                    with him. It seemed to me he was also committed to a policy of bringing the war
                    to a negotiated close. That, coming from the president elect, convinced me that
                    it was a wonderful time to go there. I got back to Bill Walker and told him I
                    would be glad to go, and set the machinery in motion at USIA to arrange for me
                    to be on loan to the department. That wasn't hard to do because it is always
                    hard to find jobs for old area directors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that the Ollie North types had
                        sort of faded from the scene after the Iran Contra thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Some had faded from the scene, some had lost interest, and some had
                    been sort of nudged into rethinking the policy. The mood had changed. You could
                    see from what was happening in Nicaragua that eventually the Sandinistas were
                    not going to be overthrown but they were going to be eroded, which is what
                    really happened. What eroded them was being in power. It is easy to overthrow -
                    it is hard to govern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the thought that the Sandinistas in Nicaragua
                        might depart the scene or would they have to get tougher and turn into a
                        Castro like regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think the feeling was that they would have to get tougher and turn
                    into a Castro type regime if they were going to stay in power forever, but they
                    weren't going to do that. A lot of folks in Latin America resent U.S.
                    supervision and intervention and fiddling around, but they don't much like
                    Sandinista type regimes either. The fact is that there were good reasons to be
                    concerned about Nicaragua. Beyond the nature of the regime itself there were
                    real regional concerns. The Sandinistas were severely out of step with the rest
                    of Central America. Central America is a region that has always enjoyed a
                    certain amount of unity through good times and bad. It is very destabilizing in
                    Central America to have one of those governments out of step and out of sympathy
                    with the rest. I think some of the feeling was too, that eventually Nicaragua
                    was going to evolve back into the Central America system. That doesn't mean that
                    it is all to the good by any means. There are huge things wrong with the way
                    Central America is governed, but at least you have removed an element of
                    instability in the region. The way Nicaragua evolved, with the Sandinistas
                    eventual electoral defeat, would influence the war in El Salvador also.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out there, what was the reading on the war
                        in El Salvador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think the reading was - nobody is going to win. Bolstering the
                    government would require an expenditure of U.S. funds and a level of commitment
                    in El Salvador that wasn't going to happen. On the other hand, after ten years
                    it became clear to us and to the guerillas that the United States wasn't going
                    to let them win and could afford not to let them win. Preventing them from
                    winning was well within the level of U.S. resources and the level of U.S.
                    commitment to El Salvador. I think one of the reasons the guerillas came to feel
                    that was the length of our commitment and the fact that they had done everything
                    they knew how to do in terms of trying to influence public opinion, and had
                    become good at it. They spent a lot of time raising support in the United
                    States. Perhaps even a majority of their financial support came from the United
                    States, but it still wasn't enough to win because El Salvador appropriations
                    kept passing in the U.S. Congress, not by much, but they kept passing. I think
                    after ten years of that, the guerillas began to see the hopelessness of it. In
                    fact, I remember one of the guerillas telling me this, that after the late '89
                    offensive, which stretched into January of '90, they came to realize the United
                    States was not going to let them win.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Bill Walker. He went out before I did. No, I've got the timing wrong
                    on going to El Salvador too. He and I talked about it a year before I actually
                    went to El Salvador and he went out shortly after that and he had been there
                    almost a year before I got there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I went there in the late summer of '89.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there a feeling in Washington that the Bush administration was going to
                    take a less doctrinaire approach towards Central America?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes. I'm not sure what the doctrine was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, particularly the early Reagan period. I mean, we

                        any of this. It was not very nuanced.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I had. In fact a couple of times. As area director I was
                    obligated to visit. Either I had to visit each post every year or my deputy did.
                    We divided them up for the purpose of writing efficiency reports. I made sure
                    that I went to El Salvador twice. The second time I went there, it was a strange
                    visit because I hadn't been officially named yet, the rumor mill had already
                    decided I was the next DCM there. I got a great deal of attention that USIA
                    directors didn't usually get. I had been in the country, and it was certainly
                    high on the list of countries that I had to keep an eye on as area director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out there in the summer of '89, what was the
                        situation? What were your impressions of the situation on the ground?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: My impression was that the war was kind of at a stalemate where both
                    sides could continue to kill each other but that the lines weren't going to
                    change very much. The guerillas weren't going to be able to expand their area of
                    operation. They weren't going to be able to get into any major cities. They were
                    going to continue to live out in the eastern provinces. They could continue to
                    blow up light poles and engage in sabotage and in small scale offensives. Also,
                    that the army was not willing to suffer the losses necessary to go out and take
                    them on in major operations, and that we weren't really going to encourage the
                    army to take on major operations. It would result in very negative human rights
                    consequences for U.S. policies. When they did that we ended up with massacres on
                    our hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you had a regime in El Salvador that was
                        working to gain control of its army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I did. We had already gone through the Duarte government, which
                    was a Christian Democratic Government, that had already begun the process of
                    peace negotiations. The Cristiani government really did represent a return of
                    the right wing to power in El Salvador, but with a different kind of candidate.
                    The difference in that candidate was in itself extremely important, as was the
                    fact that you now had one party that had been in government, a major party, and
                    had worked toward a peace agreement, followed by the other party which was
                    coming into power also with a commitment to a peace process.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>It is important to understand Freddy Cristiani and people like him. To put it in
                    overly simple terms, whatever the number of families was, there had been a
                    wealthy landowning oligarchy that had run El Salvador. What you were seeing with
                    people like Freddie Cristiani were the sons and grandsons of people who had not
                    been exactly a part of that old landowning class. They were instead immigrants
                    who had come to El Salvador from Europe and, to some extent from the Levant,
                    much as they had in Argentina around the turn of the century. They came with
                    reasonable levels of education and financial capital and a different commitment.
                    They knew that land was only one way to make money. You could also do it through
                    commerce and services. They were the people who sold Mercedes and farm equipment
                    and home appliances to the oligarchs. And, as more modern people, they ended up
                    with more money than the oligarchs.</p>
                <p>Freddie Cristiani's political generation were the sons and grandsons of these
                    successful immigrants. They were young men of great local privilege but had been
                    educated abroad, mainly in the United States. Freddie Cristiani at Georgetown.
                    They adhered to the conservative values of their fathers in that they believed
                    in free enterprise and the sanctity of ownership and all sorts of other things,
                    and certainly believed in the right of their class to run the country. But they
                    also had fairly modern ideas about democracy, social progress, and fairly modern
                    ideas about the obligation of government to provide opportunities for everybody
                    in the country. Ideas most of them had learned in the United States dictated to
                    Cristiani that a peace agreement had to be found. The war was simply not to be
                    won. It wouldn't be worth the cost of Salvadoran lives to win it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the army, the death squads and that whole
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The army was also beginning to benefit from some different leadership.
                    I'm really not sure why, but the army was evolving. The leadership of the army,
                    at the time I was there, were persons probably in their '40s or early '50s. They
                    had seen ten years of the war and they were young enough so that they had seen
                    the war on the battle lines. I think they were tired of it and I think the very
                    senior officers were tired of going to funerals. They were tired of soldiers
                    getting killed, and I know this doesn't fit the image a lot people have of the
                    Salvadoran Army. I certainly don't deny that the death squads existed, although,
                    in my opinion, were not necessarily institutionalized within the army but were a
                    pernicious combination of wealthy reactionaries and like minded army cohorts.
                    The army death squad members were acting at the behest of their wealthy patrons.
                    In that sense, they were extrofficial. I don't think the leadership of the army
                    felt strong enough to just to kick out these death squaders, nor do I believe
                    they felt particularly motivated to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, were there any situations festering?
                        I'm thinking of the killing of nuns or other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, there was a huge festering legacy of massacres, El Mozote and the
                    nuns case, and the marines who had been gunned down in the Zona Rosa, and the
                    Hilton Hotel assassinations. Those last three cases all involved American
                    casualties. There is a small monument in the courtyard outside the embassy to
                    Americans who lost their lives.</p>
                <p>There was a legacy of atrocities on both sides. The government could come up with
                    horrible things that had happened to its people. People blown up in buildings.
                    People killed when the guerillas blow up a light pole as they happen to be
                    walking by. People who could have been captured but were shot on the spot.
                    Terrible things happening in villages where the guerillas wanted to enforce some
                    kind of support and participation on the part of villagers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you explain what the nuns case was, and had it been
                        settled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It had been settled only superficially. It certainly had not been
                    settled to the satisfaction of the people in the United States. People had been
                    caught and tried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, how did Walker use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Walker and I went back a long way, and his description of my role was
                    as an alter ego. I was there to run the embassy, substitute for him when he
                    couldn't be there, to take as much of his burden as I could to allow him to deal
                    with the reality of U.S. policy and to spend as much time as possible in contact
                    with the upper levels of the government and the rest of Salvadoran society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into some more of the details, what about
                        the security aspects there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Fortress Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the new embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, this was the old one, and it had been bombed and lost part of its
                    central tower, and we had all been crammed into a smaller amount of space, much
                    of which was either one story or underground. There was a wall all the way
                    around it, the ambassador's office had no windows in it. My office had one which
                    was always curtained and shielded. Our offices were terrible. The ambassador's
                    office was probably no bigger than the room we are sitting in.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about something that is about 25x10
                        feet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: These were not luxurious quarters for anybody. But it was pretty
                    secure, it never got hit while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about going from hither to yon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Big, big security packages. The ambassador had an armored Cadillac, a
                    follow car, a lead car, probably four American security agents with him and
                    another six Salvadorans riding in both of those cars. I always traveled in an
                    armored Suburban with local guards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: My family was with me. My daughter wasn't, she was in college, but my
                    wife and son were. We lived in a beautiful DCM residence. Housing was quite
                    lovely, but with lots of walls around it and a lot of security precautions, with
                    guards there all the time in control of the gate. The DCM residence probably had
                    four local guards at all times. I hardly ever drove a car the whole time I was
                    there, but you get used to that kind of security after awhile. It also has some
                    advantages, you don't get stuck in traffic jams, with the guards there are
                    always people around to run errands for you. It is a luxurious but dangerous
                    life because you forget some of the realities of how folks have to live,
                    including your subordinates who don't have that protection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I got there in mid 89, the ambassador was there for a day then took
                    off for a vacation, so I was really thrown into it immediately. I sort of felt
                    like I was floundering a little bit but I had good people around who kept me
                    going in the right direction. I remember that after a couple of days we were
                    sent a dipnote (diplomatic note - an official communiqu� from one government to
                    another) to hand over to the president and I began to learn something about El
                    Salvador right away. As I mentioned, I had met the president before in
                    Miami.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>President Cristiani was at his weekend retreat, which is on a volcanic lake
                    outside San Salvador. The only way I was going to be able to deliver this note
                    within the designated time frame was to go up there and visit him. We made the
                    calls and I loaded into a Suburban again, this time with another car with a full
                    package. Keiko, my wife, went with me, so we went up to call on the Cristianis
                    at their weekend place. It's kind of fun when you make your first call on the
                    president of a sovereign nation, even a small one, and you are greeted by the
                    president and his wife in bathing suits. It was the first time I had ever felt
                    overdressed in my life, and I only had a sport shirt on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we pleased with Cristiani as president? I think
                        there was concern at the time because he had come out of a fairly right wing
                        thing. Did we become comfortable with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, we did become comfortable with him. The concern was because of
                    the party he came out of. Remember, I discovered when I visited him in Miami
                    that he is a very convincing guy, and we believed that he was sincerely
                    interested in finding a way to end this war and he was willing to negotiate to
                    make that happen.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the ambassador got back, we went to call on Padre Ellacuria, who
                    was the rector of the Universidad Central Americana (UCA), which was the Jesuit
                    University in El Salvador. He was later assassinated in the early days of the
                    November offensive.</p>
                <p>I remember the visit clearly because one of the things we wanted to know was what
                    he thought of Cristiani. His message to us was fascinating. He basically said,
                    “Remember that all the enemies of peace are not necessarily on the right in this
                    country. I have been received by President Cristiani, had talks with him, had
                    much more courteous treatment and interest from him, than I ever had from
                    President Duarte. I believe he is committed to peace.” We came out of that
                    meeting feeling that the chances for a negotiated settlement were better than we
                    had thought. He had influence, and the people he had influence on had influence
                    on the guerillas. A lot of people don't like to hear an American say that, but
                    it is true. Much of the guerilla leadership had been at the UCA, many of them
                    had been influenced by the liberation theology that came out of that
                    university.</p>
                <p>That, by the way, was another reason peace was possible. Liberation theology and
                    its attendant dependency theories were rapidly falling out of style during this
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, did the two sides talk to each other through

                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think at that stage it wasn't really a matter of talking to each
                    other in the sense of negotiating. It was more a matter of sending messages, or
                    sort of basic communication. Dialogue is the issue when you start getting into
                    negotiations. That is when it is important who you talk to.</p>
                <p>We had lots of ways of getting our thoughts to the other side without direct
                    talks with the principals involved. We did not have direct conversations with
                    any guerillas at that point but we talked to a lot of people who did. We knew
                    how to use the media also. The guerillas listened to the radithe Voice of
                    America for exampland watched television. It was not a major problem to deliver
                    messages to guerillas saying the United States says it is interested in peace.
                    Convincing them we were telling the truth was a different and more difficult
                    problem.</p>
                <p>It was also difficult to convince the right wing in El Salvador that we were
                    really interested in peace, as was convincing the Salvadoran military. In some
                    ways maybe it was more difficult.</p>
                <p>Many Salvadorans worked closely with us through ten years of war. During most of
                    that time the American government was not very interested in peace but had a
                    policy o“let's win this.” The reaction you tended to get from them was, “Yeah,
                    yeah, we know why you are saying all this stuff about peace. But come on now,
                    we're among friends, let's talk about what the real thing is.” We had to
                    convince them this wasn't just propaganda and window dressing, that we were
                    serious about it.</p>
                <p>You can go back quite awhile to the situation at the time of the nuns massacre
                    when Bob White was the ambassador and was absolutely convinced he had been lied
                    to. He was absolutely furious with the government and the Salvadoran military.
                    They had lied to him, but I don't think they really understood how justifiably
                    furious he really was or why. They really didn't believe that we would let a few
                    murders here and there get in the way of winning the war. And I believe there
                    were more than a few Americanboth official and unofficiawho shared that belief
                    and encouraged them in it.</p>
                <p>So, we had a double job on our hands. One was to convince the military, and the
                    other was to convince the guerillas that the U.S. was serious about peace
                    negotiations. There was, of course, a similar problem on the far right of the
                    political spectrum, but by that time we had pretty much read D'Aubuisson and his
                    nitwit cronies out of the equation. We didn't talk to them and they thought we
                    were about as bad as the guerillas and the Jesuits.</p>
                <p>We had a job to do within the U.S. Mission. It was a very subtle issue, not a
                    matter of loyalty and disloyalty, but is a matter of the human tendency to keep
                    doing the job you have always done. After all we had sent American soldiers out
                    there to train Salvadoran military units. Their job was to train people to fight
                    a war, to do it well, and do it aggressively. At the same time they were to be
                    mindful of human rights and not expose themselves to any more hostile fire than
                    absolutely necessary. Big job.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Now we had to convince them that lt. wasn't exactly like that. We wanted them to
                    be in position, we wanted them to be sharp, we wanted them to keep training. But
                    we also wanted them to start living with the frustration of not being very big
                    offensively. They were usually not going to go out and get the enemy. They were
                    in more of a defensive situation. That is not very comfortable to a lot of
                    soldiers, especially very good ones. So we also had to convince some of our own
                    people that peace negotiations were a serious business and not just something we
                    were saying. It is not only convincing leadership, you have to monitor all the
                    time to make sure that you and the embassy, whether it is in the MIL Group or
                    the AID Mission or whoever it is, are not sending signals that are contrary to
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the CIA was on the wagon with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, sort of, but again it's a little bit of the same problem. The
                    tendency to do what you have always done. In the CIA and the military, the guys
                    who understand war and are good at it, if left too much to their own devices
                    tend to keep doing it. That tendency to keep doing what you are good at also
                    occurs in other organizations. It's quite human.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is really one of the few places that the CIA could be
                        operational with fun, getting out there and doing what a lot of these guys
                        like to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That is true, although one of the things we had going for us was that
                    the war wasn't as much fun as it used to be. It had gone on too long.</p>
                <p>But subtlety is difficult. You have to be so damn careful. Instead of going out
                    there and stomping on the commies, you have to nuance everything politically.
                    Our advisors were good soldiers, they didn't want to screw things up, they
                    wanted to follow policy, but it wasn't easy. How do you maintain military morale
                    and the sharpness in training, and the kind of training that keeps people from
                    violating human rights, when peace is in the offing? It is the old “nobody wants
                    to be the last guy to die in this war,” so how do you keep the edge without
                    acting, that's the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, the left wing, movie stars, rock people, and
                        writers who tended to go for leftist causes had sort of adopted the
                        Sandinistas and the guerilla movement in El Salvador. Had this died out by
                        the time you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, the political activists in the United States on the left were
                    still very active but the glitterati had lost interest by that time. The
                    offensive and the Jesuit case sort of rekindled their interest but we did not
                    have that kind of visitors. Bianca Jagger didn't come and I don't remember any
                    Hollywood movie stars coming down there during my time. We certainly still had
                    the professionals in the church groups who would still bring delegations of
                    church people down. It is important to remember that the Salvadoran guerillas
                    were the second largest recipient of American aid in El Salvador; the Salvadoran
                    government of course was the largest with its U.S. government funding.</p>
                <p>Q: Where did the aid to the guerillas come from?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A lot from church groups. My guess is that a major part of it came
                    from church groups. It's hard to count it since they were not particularly
                    anxious to have it counted. I think most of it was donated by people who really
                    felt that if you said, “This is only going for humanitarian stuff, it is not
                    going for military stuff,” that that would happen. Of course it is a nonsense
                    proposition. If you give the money to the FMLN (Farabundo Marti Liberacion
                    National), it is really stupid to think they even have the accounting skill, let
                    alone the will, to segregate the funding. Money is money.</p>
                <p>I think what happened in U.S. politics is instructive. Those people who hated the
                    U.S. government's Salvador policy because we were supporting a government they
                    didn't approve of, and because we were supporting a war which they didn't
                    approve of either, concluded that since they had failed for a long time to
                    defeat the policy and the aid in Congress, they would countervail with their own
                    contributions to the other side. But countervailing did put them into a morally
                    ambiguous situation because they were funding some of the violence that they so
                    hated. Nevertheless, they would come down in groups, they would come down as
                    individuals, and we would receive them in the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>I have to talk about those visits because it was a conscious part of our
                    strategy. There was a lot of history that said that the embassy had sort of
                    blown it from time to time with a lot of groups that came down and were opposed
                    to U.S. policy. We either wouldn't see them at all, or we would send out a
                    defenseless junior officer to see them, which would often mean that the group
                    felt insulted, and the officers sometimes were neither experienced enough nor
                    well briefed enough to be able to handle it well. Walker and I decided that
                    virtually anybody who came down would be seen by someone at the senior level, we
                    would push it up as senior as we could get it, and we would not waste a whole
                    lot of time trying to figure out “is this group important or is this group not
                    important” because, frankly it was more efficient to see everybody than to try
                    to sort out which group was important and get it wrong. Our perspective, and our
                    sources, either on our own or relying on the department, weren't very good at
                    figuring out who was important in Colorado. So we would see them all and we
                    spent a lot of time at it. I think it was very important just to see these
                    people and to talk them through the policy, and to keep hitting on the fact that
                    we were in favor of peace negotiations, but that peace negotiations meant that
                    neither side was going to win. Americans concerned about El Salvador were going
                    to be faced with choices, just as the U.S. government had been. If you are for
                    peace negotiations, then you have recognized that side you favor is not going to
                    win. We found a distressing number of groups who said they were in favor of
                    peace negotiations but basically they weren't because they wanted their friends
                    to win. Remember, too, there were also groups that came down supporting the
                    government also.</p>
                <p>We saw some of the same attitudes congressional staffers. People from Chris
                    Dodd's staff came down. The fact is, they wanted the guerillas - even a
                    particular faction of the FMLN - to win, if not outright to at least gain a
                    powerful position in postwar politics. People from Jesse Helms staff came down
                    and they wanted the right wingers - both military and civilian - to win.. Both
                    sides would come and talk to us in the embassy, then go out and talk to people
                    outside the embassy and say, “Don't listen to guys in the embassy, they haven't
                    really got it right. What do they know? I'm telling you what it is really like.”
                    This means the Helms people would come down and tell the military to “hang
                    tough” because the peace negotiations weren't really going anyplace. Others were
                    telling the guerilla leadership the same thing at times. This made it hard to do
                    peace negotiations, but not impossible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">How did you find the reporting aspect of our embassy at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I had a particular philosophy on reporting, which I think drove the
                    first political counselor I worked with there absolutely nuts. He was one of
                    these guys that wanted to do big think pieces, big major cables that would seek
                    to influence policy, and I felt that in the Salvador situation, and in modern
                    times, what really counted was spot reporting. Getting the facts out, getting
                    them out quickly, in a way trying to truth squad the press. If the press gets it
                    right don't worry too much about it, just keep the details going. But be alert
                    for those situations where they have gotten it wrong, and if they have gotten it
                    wrong in a way that is going to damage policy, you have to get to the Department
                    quickly. Don't worry about the big think pieces, because nobody is going to read
                    them but the desk officer anyway. Besides, Washington had made up its mind about
                    policy in El Salvador and none of us in the leadership at the embassy had any
                    quarrel with that policy. We basically like it. That frustrates a certain kind
                    of political officer and it pleases others. Some people like digging into spot
                    reporting and keeping two or three fast cables going every day and thinking that
                    is a good job, but other people are driven nuts by that kind of routine.
                    Basically, it was reporting designed to keep us looking alert, and looking like
                    we were paying attention (which we were), and not getting blind sided by all the
                    other reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was our liaison with Nicaragua, our embassy
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We infoed each other on all our cables, all Central American countries
                    did, but we didn't spend a lot of time talking to the embassy in Nicaragua. A
                    couple of times we had meetings with the country team in Honduras, Ambassador
                    Chris Arcos and three or four of his people came over and sat down with our
                    country team and talked. Remember, that's a longer border. There were a lot of
                    irritating issues with Honduras. I don't remember spending a lot of time
                    worrying about what was going on in Nicaragua at that point.</p>
                <p>In February of 1990 Violetta Chamorro was elected president. The Sandinistas had
                    been beaten in a free and fair election. That was important. It influenced the
                    peace negotiations. The Sandinistas were no longer what they had been and the
                    Soviet Union was in decline. That did influence the guerillas. Suddenly they
                    were left with nobody but Fidel Castro, and they weren't dumb guys. They knew
                    Fidel Castro was a pretty weak reed to rely on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the November attack of '89. Where were
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: When it all started, I was at home. We did not have real hard
                    intelligence that anything was coming. It started on November 11th, as bad as I
                    am on dates I can remember what we used to call Armistice Day. The night before
                    that, we had the Marine Ball and much of the embassy leadership was at a hotel
                    ballroom have a pretty good time. There were lots of Salvadoran guests also.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>Of course as usually happens we read reports after the fact and thought that
                    maybe if we evaluated them the right way, maybe we would have guessed something
                    was coming. But the fact is we didn't. I don't think the Salvadorans did
                    either.</p>
                <p>The next day, the 11th, nothing in particular had us worried and we had gone home
                    at supper time, as we usually did. I was in my residence and the ambassador was
                    in his, and around 8:30 or 9:00 one hell of a fire fight broke out close my
                    house.</p>
                <p>We were used to hearing gunfire every now and then during the night, or hearing a
                    telephone pole get blown up, so when it first started I thought that it was
                    closer than usual but was not very worried. But it just kept going on and on.
                    They had attacked all through the city and the guerillas around my house were
                    trying to get at President Cristiani's house. He didn't happen to be there at
                    the time, fortunately. They really came close to getting into his house, but
                    were finally driven off by a patrol of the Salvadoran army.</p>
                <p>It was pretty tough. We had one wounded government soldier take refuge in the
                    kitchen of our house. I went down to the kitchen and found our cook bandaging
                    this guy, who had been shot through the hand. We had fighting during most of the
                    night. We weren't sure of the extent of it until we all got to work the next
                    morning. We all did get in to the embassy the next morning and began to gather
                    intelligence and get the reports. Then we realized that something major had
                    happened. We didn't know how long it would last nor how serious it was going to
                    be.</p>
                <p>As you know, it didn't go away very quickly. It got a little bit worse every
                    night. It then became evident to us that this was a major push. It is hard for
                    me to sort out particular events but we sort of settled into a routine which
                    meant that we would all consult each morning with our own security people to
                    figure out when it was safe to go to the embassy. Often we would be late getting
                    there because we would have our own security patrols out and through liaison
                    with the army and everybody else, figuring out whether the routes we would have
                    to take to work would be reasonably safe. So we would all wait for a call and
                    then usually get into the office around 9:00 or 9:30. Then we would get
                    everybody together and try to assess the night before and try to figure out what
                    the military situation was. We found that much of the eastern suburbs of San
                    Salvador were in guerilla hands.</p>
                <p>Just about the time we had settled into that routine, the guerillas attacked the
                    Sheraton Hotel which created a very difficult situation for us. We had a group
                    oU.S. Army special forces trainers who had been going through some routine,
                    previously scheduled training exercises with the Salvadoran army and were
                    staying in the Sheraton Hotel. They had all their weapons with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The guerillas occupied the hotel. We were told they looking for a special
                    Organization of American States negotiator who had come to town. He was the
                    target, but they went into the wrong tower of the hotel and ended up occupying
                    the side with this group of American green berets barricaded into one end of a
                    corridor, heavily armed and not about to give up. There were also some American
                    civilians - some AID people and some commercial people - who were in the same
                    tower. So we were faced with a situation of the guerillas occupying the
                    building, a group of armed Americans who were certainly not going to be captured
                    without a fight, and various civilians scattered around in other rooms around
                    the hotel.</p>
                <p>Our very aggressive, Spanisspeaking admin counselor, an immigrant from Latin
                    America himself and a can do kind of guy, managed to get through on a telephone
                    to some of the guerilla leadership. I then got a call on the radio from the
                    ambassador saying, “This guy is trying to talk to the guerillas and I can't get
                    him on the radio. You have to get him and tell him 'don't do that'.” So I had
                    this absurd conversation on an open radio saying, “Stop it.” He said, “BUT I CAN
                    GET THEM OUT. LET ME DO IT.” I had to tell him, “No, you can't do it. As an
                    embassy official, you CANNOT negotiate with these guys. Now let it go.” And he
                    did.</p>
                <p>So the Sheraton occupation created some exciting moments. We ended up with Delta
                    Force in the country that night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what Delta Force is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Delta Force is an elite group of the U.S. army which is trained in
                    hostage rescue. It was all very hush, hush, and secret except President Bush
                    mentioned it the morning after they had left the country. We were never, ever to
                    tell anybody that they were there or had been there, but the President did
                    mention it on radio and television. They flew into the country, I don't remember
                    the size of the force but it was a lot of people, and they had been positioned
                    around the hotel. The commander had been to the embassy and we had a meeting
                    late into the night the night before.</p>
                <p>Eventually, we got the people out. The guerillas sort of disappeared after they
                    decided they had gotten into the wrong place and didn't need this fight. They
                    escaped through the back doors and down through a ravine. San Salvador is cut
                    through by a lot of ravines and they make good guerilla routes since they have a
                    lot of vegetation at the bottom and people don't live down there. They quietly
                    slipped away from the hotel, then it became a matter of getting those people out
                    of there and getting our own military people out of there without them shooting
                    anybody on the way out. There had been a big fire fight at the beginning of this
                    thing. It was not a peaceful occupation but a contested occupation. I had
                    awakened the morning of that occupation to the sound of a terrific fire
                    fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it come as a surprise that they were able to mount
                        such a thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes. Not only that they were able, but that they did it. The offensive
                    was their last hurrah. We were afraid for awhile that it might be only their
                    first final offensive, but it proved to be their final. A couple of years later
                    we had a peace agreement. At some point I have to deal with the evacuation of
                    our own dependents. Also the Jesuit murders, I have to deal with that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about those.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: OK. The offensive started on November 11, 1989. A few days later we
                    awake to the hideous news that there had been a group of people murdered at the
                    Central American University, including Padre Ellacuria and some other priests,
                    their housekeeper, and one child.</p>
                <p>We didn't know who did it. Although much of the world was willing to jump to the
                    conclusion that the army had done it, the fact was, nobody really knew. Some of
                    us, including me, entertained the idea that it also could have been the
                    guerillas. Eyewitness accounts identified men in army uniforms, but that on its
                    face did not exclude the guerillas. Remember, we had had conversations with
                    people at the university who indicated they favored the peace alternative. It
                    wasn't entirely beyond my imagination that someone on the left had decided to
                    get rid of these people.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, it was the army that did it. However, the army has never
                    accepted the notion that it ordered the murders and that has never been proven.
                    It may or may not have beeI don't know the answer. I'm inclined to think that it
                    was not ordered by the high command of the army but was the act of a particular
                    colonel named Benavides, who thought he had authorization from a more senior
                    level of the army but may not have actually had it. It was a stupid, murderous
                    act that complicated everything and made it more difficult to bring the war to
                    an end. It cost a lot of support in the United States for a negotiated
                    settlement. Remember, our job was to convince people that a negotiated
                    settlement was better than the bloodshed it would take for either side to win.
                    Negotiations mean that some people aren't going to get punished. That's what
                    peace negotiations are aboupeople on both sides were going to escape punishment.
                    A lot of people understandably hate that and think that crime ought to be
                    punished, that there should be retribution for atrocities. People who like
                    vengeance as a political principle, hate the idea of negotiated settlement.
                    Well, the murder of the Jesuits made negotiations all that much harder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we all over the Salvadoran government on this by
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, we were. I headed an embassy task force on the Jesuit case which
                    met daily trying to figure out what we knew and trying to use all our resources
                    to get at what the evidence was going to be. We were under increasing pressure
                    from the local Jesuits, who were convinced we knew things that we didn't know.
                    They were convinced we knew who did it, but wouldn't tell them. The fact was, we
                    didn't know. The Salvadoran government knew things that it wasn't telling us.
                    They began to suspect right away their people were involved in it. It took them
                    sometime to sort it out, and it took more time before we got enough wind of it
                    to go to them and say, “All right, come clean, let us know.” When it all came
                    out, it was a very complicated story and I would just as soon not deal with the
                    individuals involved.</p>
                <p>Eventually, it came out; I think we found out within a few days what the real
                    story was. A lot of our problem in the Jesuit case was dealing with people who
                    had an institutional stake in not trusting us, or saying they didn't trust us.
                    The whole Jesuit case was a classic example of the moving shoreline that we
                    could never reach. The first things we heard was, “Well, we will never find out.
                    We'll never really see the evidence of who did it. We know who did it, but we'll
                    never find out, we'll never see it.” Well, we did, so then it was, “Well, there
                    will never be an indictment.” Well, there was. So then it was, “Well, there will
                    never be a trial.” Well, there finally was and it took a huge amount of pressure
                    and intervention on our part to make sure there was a trial.</p>
                <p>One of my jobs was with the president of the Salvadoran Supreme Court, who was a
                    difficult guy to deal with. I spent a lot of time jawboning him on how there had
                    to be a trial and what had to happen for transparency, and trying at the same
                    time to learn the Salvadoran legal system and understand that it had to follow
                    the norms of their system also. At any rate, we finally got the trial and then
                    the shoreline jumped again and it was, “Well, there will never be a conviction.”
                    Eventually there was a conviction.</p>
                <p>One day, toward the end of the trial as it became evident there was going to be a
                    conviction, I remember thinking I was seeing a sea change among the American
                    critics of our Salvador policy. I was waiting around in the lobby outside the
                    courtroom waiting for the trial to begin. All these people I had gotten to know
                    over the years from various church groups and other groups that monitored the
                    Latin American human rights were there, but they were all there talking about
                    Guatemala. I suddenly realized they were losing interest in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way they were motivated by causes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, the peace agreement was coming; the Jesuit case was going to
                    trial, and they could see there was enough momentum going there. You would never
                    get anybody to say they were satisfied with the results; there was going to be a
                    result that would be hard to present as a triumph over evil. I think they had
                    decided that Salvador was no longer their cause, but Guatemala would be.
                    Salvador was no longer going to provide these great examples of Central American
                    misbehavior and the misguided nature of U.S. policy in encouraging that
                    misbehavior. Guatemala was still there and it was going to get worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, many of these people had learned their trade of
                        protesting in the '60s, and essentially the United States is the evil empire
                        in their estimation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was, but there was self interest involved too. It's not so much
                    individual self interest, as it is institutional self interest. These people are
                    people who like to work in the field of foreign affairs, and because they like
                    to work in the field of foreign affairs and because they want to be influential,
                    to satisfy themselves in career terms and also to raise the funds to keep their
                    organizations going, it is really important for them to somehow illustrate that
                    the U.S. government cannot be trusted with U.S. foreign policy. If the U.S.
                    government suddenly got it all right, then there would be less need for these
                    groups who monitor performance and make policy recommendations. But the people
                    who are staffers for these groups have a stake in convincing everybody, and
                    especially their donors, that the U.S. government can't be trusted with U.S.
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>So, the shoreline moved one more time, there was a verdict, the accused were
                    convicted, and they did go to prison until basically the UN and its truth
                    commission made their final reports on the war and sort of let them out. But
                    they all did some time. Oh, I have to deal with the peace negotiations.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's talk about the dependents.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Again, I don't remember which day but it was a few days after the
                    Sheraton takeover. We woke up to fighting all over the city. A senior member of
                    the embassy had been trapped in his house all night. The guerillas either knew
                    who he was or they had decided they wanted his house for its strategic location.
                    They tried to take his house and he, his wife, and a guest ended up barricaded
                    in the house returning fire. They were rescued at the last minute by the army.
                    One member of the embassy had been captured by the guerillas and was being held.
                    We knew where and we knew his situation. There had been fire fights around a
                    number of houses where embassy people lived.</p>
                <p>Earlier on the ambassador had said, “I've got to concentrate on this war and
                    morale in the embassy, and everything we do, so I want you to take
                    responsibility for calling an evacuation when it is necessary.”</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>During periods of combat we would gather at the ambassador's residence and among
                    other things decide whether it was safe to go to the chancery. That morning we
                    realized it was going to be hard to get to the chancery. It was getting worse
                    and worse. I told the ambassador it was time to evacuate dependents and
                    officials who really did not have to be there.</p>
                <p>We got our administrative people on the phone told them to begin to arrange for a
                    flight. We were looking for about 24 hours later. We decided to call all
                    dependents into the chancery right away. We told everybody to pack a bag and
                    bring sleeping bags, just in case, and to go to the chancery because we were
                    probably going to stay in the chancery overnight. We figured that when we got
                    the plane in there, we would already be a step up by having everybody camping
                    out in the chancery.</p>
                <p>Then we began to wrestle on the phone with the issue of mandatory vs. voluntary
                    departure. Mandatory departure means the ambassador orders all dependents and
                    nonessential embassy people to leave. Voluntary means that evacuation is
                    available but individuals may elect to stay. Mandatory departure achieves the
                    maximum drawdown, but takes away flexibility and can have a pretty bad effect on
                    morale. Voluntary departure is great for flexibility, but risks leaving to many
                    people in a risky place. The paid transportation and per diem allowances are the
                    same in either case.</p>
                <p>We had a particular problem - a number of wives in the embassy who, although they
                    were there as dependents, were professionals and didn't have any kids with them.
                    They were saying, “No, we want to stay. In the first place, we can be useful,
                    and secondly we have no kids and we want to stay here with our husbands.” The
                    ambassador and I were very sympathetic to that point of view. Washington was
                    urging us to go mandatory on this. We were basically saying, “No, we don't want
                    to go mandatory because we can talk them out, we can reduce, we can get
                    everybody out, but there are some of these people who want to stay and we are
                    sympathetic with them. Besides, we can use them.” We finally got away with that
                    and we were able to get everybody out that we really couldn't use, but we didn't
                    do it by making it mandatory. We did it by talking people out. We got people
                    into buses and out to the airport and told them they would all be coming
                    back.</p>
                <p>Also, I had had conversations on the phone with the American Republics Bureau at
                    State saying, “Remember Jeff, get people out of there sooner rather than later;
                    remember that politics don't count; the only thing that counts is safety.” I
                    know why they were saying that, but anybody who says that politics don't count
                    in a situation like that just isn't paying attention. An evacuation of the
                    American Embassy, handled badly, could have had a devastating effect on the
                    morale of that government and people, and at a time when the people of San
                    Salvador were furious at the guerillas for what they were doing to their
                    city.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>The FMLN were suffering a hemorrhage in terms of public support for their cause.
                    People were really angry at them. But if we had had this huge mandatory dramatic
                    evacuation of the U.S. Embassy, it would have been awful. Remember, we had
                    already had UN agencies pulling people out before we did. We did not declare it
                    mandatory, we tried to explain it to the press and the government by saying,
                    “No, you know, it is war but it is getting close to Christmas anyway, and we are
                    sending wives and kids home.” It helped a lot that it was Christmas time, that
                    the evacuation was not mandatory and that we had told people they would be
                    coming back.</p>
                <p>Eventually, we would have a hard time getting them back because even though the
                    offensive wound down and ended about mid January, the department had some
                    understandable reluctance to have people go back. They just spent a whole lot of
                    money to get all these people out; the offensive was over but there was no peace
                    agreement yet. So the tendency was to not let the people go back. At the
                    embassy, the ambassador, a lot of other people, and I felt very strongly that it
                    was essential to get people back because this was an embassy that was going to
                    have to support the peace negotiations. So the symbolism of having our families
                    there was very important, and embassies without dependents attract “cowboys”,
                    the people you don't want there during peace negotiations. The personnel system
                    will never be clever enough to protect you against that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served 18 months in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: So you know. That is precisely what we did not want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what you mean by “cowboys.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I mean persons, people, who are more comfortable in a wartime, high
                    security situation. I don't want to sound disrespectful to those people, because
                    I don't feel that way.</p>
                <p>Q: They seem to be hard drinking, womanizing, kind of like living by themselves
                    and living a garrison life. It gives a frame of mind that is not conducive to a
                    diplomatic mission.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Certainly not, and not in the kind of period we were going into.
                    Eventually, we just jawboned and jawboned and about six weeks later our families
                    all came back.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>Let's see - what else do I have to talk about? ARA (Bureau of Inter American
                    Affairs, at that time, I guess it's called WHA now), urged the ambassador and me
                    to take a break. We had been under a lot of strain, so Walker took a little bit
                    of time over Christmas. When he came back I went back to the states for a couple
                    of weeks. I went through a period of consultations in the department, talked to
                    a few visitors. It was a tough time to be out of there, because the morning I
                    arrived in Washington there was a big mortar attack on San Salvador and I felt
                    terrible. There is a funny feeling when you leave and things are still going on.
                    You feel guilty for not being there, but once I got out of Washington and took
                    some vacation and went up to Ohio where my wife and son were, I felt a little
                    more relaxed about it. It must have been the middle of January when I got back
                    to San Salvador.</p>
                <p>In terms of feelings - go back to the evacuation, I remember a great sense of
                    relief when my wife and son left because that was one less responsibility, and
                    it was getting increasingly difficult to go back and forth between residence and
                    office. Since I had taken a sleeping bag with me when we brought everybody into
                    the office, I ended up staying in my office for the rest of the week. It was
                    four or five days before I finally went home. I decided to go home and see if my
                    dog and cat were still with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be 1990 by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It would have been January 1990. The offensive ended. As those things
                    often do, it just sort of petered out but it was evident that the FMLN was
                    withdrawing their people from the city and the feelers for negotiations began to
                    trickle in. Various factions of the FMLN began to talk to people who talked to
                    us.</p>
                <p>I'm going to studiously avoid which faction was doing which, there were a lot of
                    differences. Some of them were on board earlier than others, and it was
                    important to play those differences. But I can't remember the sets of initials
                    anymore. Except, there is one reason why the factionalism was important. Each
                    faction had its own set of supporters in the United States which only added to
                    the silliness of the whole thing.</p>
                <p>The peace negotiations went on for almost a year. The peace agreement was finally
                    concluded on the last day of 1990. Eleven months after the final offensive had
                    ended (they had done a great deal of damage to the country and the city), they
                    finally got a peace agreement. It's a very complicated thing to talk about. Day
                    to day we were working on it - feelers here, feelers there - and trying to
                    defuse the Jesuit case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we there? Why wasn't this between the Salvadoran
                        government and the guerillas? What was our role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Our role was to convince the Salvadoran government and, more
                    particularly, the Salvadoran military, that negotiations were possible and could
                    be done. Also to convince the guerillas that we really were in favor of peace
                    negotiations. On the guerilla side, there was an understandable suspicion that
                    the Americans were only talking about negotiations but were going to screw them
                    in the end, as usual.</p>
                <p>Remember, Central Americans are Americans too, and suspicion of metropolitan
                    outsiders is deep in the character of New World people. It's like North
                    Americans saying, “The United States has never lost a war nor won a treaty.”
                    Well, the fact is, the United States has lost wars and has done pretty well on
                    treaties. We're pretty good negotiators actually.</p>
                <p>Central Americans and Latin Americans have a lot of those same frontier
                    attitudes, except the people they think will really take you to the cleaners in
                    a negotiation are not necessarily those slick Europeans, but rather are those
                    sharp Yankee traders from up north. There is a lot of history that says those
                    “sharp Yankee traders” have time and again taken them to the cleaners.</p>
                <p>In Salvador, this sort of rude fear of negotiations that the Americans were in on
                    was contradictory. On the one hand, if the Americans were in, they would turn it
                    to their advantage and you would lose, but on the other hand, if the Americans
                    were not in the negotiations wouldn't be worth much. On the far right, we were
                    also mistrusted for some other reasons. The logic went something like this: “The
                    Americans are a bunch of turncoats who used us because we were good anti
                    Communists for years and now that they have lost interest, they are going to
                    betray us. Once again we'll have been screwed by our so called friends.”</p>
                <p>If you delve into the Latin American right wing, you can find two real hatreds
                    based on that sense of betrayal. They hate the United States because the United
                    States betrayed them when it counted on them to protect their interests and
                    property against the left. We did it time and again. And they hate the church.
                    Liberation theology in the Catholic Church in Latin American created a
                    wellspring of hatred on the far right. “These people that we had counted on for
                    generations to protect our interests have betrayed us. Their job was to protect
                    the status pro, that was what they had always done in Latin America since the
                    time of the conquest and in the '60s they betrayed us; they became traitors;
                    they joined the communists against us.” I know that sounds crazy, but that is
                    the way they think.</p>
                <p>Q: Were the Cubans a factor in this at all?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, I think with lip service and minor kind of supplies and services,
                    but Cuba is too poor and the Soviets had lost interest by then. I don't believe
                    the Cubans were a factor. I don't think the Cubans have enough surplus to
                    contribute anything to anybody. If you're a guerilla type, you can go there and
                    visit if you want a safe haven. If you can get to Havana you can be safe. They
                    were not a factor.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>The real factor was the increasing isolation that the guerillas sensed with the
                    decline of the Soviet Union. The bloom was off the ideological rose. The smart
                    ones among the guerillas could see that. I guess they thought, “Wait a minute,
                    we are alone. This is all done. The days of Che Guevara are long gone. The tide
                    of revolution in Latin America is gone. Latin America is changing and we are
                    sitting here playing a dumb old game that isn't going to get us any place.” I
                    guess I knew that negotiations were coming when we began to get feelers about
                    scholarships to the United States. “What are the chances that, if there is a
                    peace agreement, some of our folks could get fellowships to go study for an MBA?
                    We have to learn this world of free enterprise that everybody is talking about.”
                    I'm not kidding, we did get those feelers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to give a positive response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were able to give a positive “maybe,” and I felt pretty good with
                    that. I didn't have to get a Fulbright for everybody. There would be people who
                    would be willing to fund that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The world is changing and you are getting these
                        international or private groups that go out and negotiate, like the Jimmy
                        Carter Institute. Were any of these people beginning to come in on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not so much those people on the Salvador negotiations. The UN was the
                    Godfather of the negotiating process. They gave it a certain legitimacy and
                    security. I remember the Carter Center people were interested. Bob Pastor was
                    there. He is an old Latin America hand. The NGO (Non Governmental Organizations)
                    activists on the periphery were the more specific Latin American groups, like
                    the Washington Office on Latin America and the Council on Hemispheric
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OAS [Organization of American States]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think the UN sort of co opted what would have been an OAS role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is not an OAS thing particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not at that time. In a way you are talking about what we've lumped
                    under the generic term of NGOs (Non governmental Organizations). They were very
                    important in the more general Salvadoran equation. We were talking to them all
                    the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>I haven't talked about congressional delegations. A lot of congressional
                    delegations came to El Salvador. Maybe that is a subject I need to get into. We
                    had two kinds of congressional delegations; the ones that were there to look at
                    the general conduct of the war; and the ones that came to look at the Jesuit
                    case and the conduct of the embassy regarding the case. Whatever I say about
                    congressional delegations, I'd like to preface by saying that I didn't see any
                    delegations that came for tourism and didn't work. I hear about those at other
                    posts, but we didn't get any. Maybe it's just that El Salvador was not a great
                    vacation spot at that time.</p>
                <p>They often came on holidays, which annoyed our over stretched staff no end. When
                    you've had people working 60 hour weeks and then you tell them you don't get a
                    weekend either, it is kind of tough on them. On the other hand, if I were a
                    congressman and going to get on a plane and leave the office, you better believe
                    I'd do it on a holiday weekend. I need to mention one Congressman who was
                    extremely helpful to us in very smart ways. That was Congressman Joe
                    Moakley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Congressman Joe Moakley of Massachusetts. A Democrat, with close ties
                    to the Catholic church, a man of good liberal conscience, who nevertheless
                    believed the war could come to a negotiated end. The kind of man who knows that
                    you don't get negotiations going by declaring one side of the equation - the
                    Salvadoran military - to be a bunch of beasts. He knew that was a nonstarter,
                    and did a lot of things just to help us help the negotiations get along, and
                    took a lot of heat off us.</p>
                <p>We were under pressure from people to solve the Jesuit case, no matter what, and
                    as we had people among the Jesuits in El Salvador saying we were keeping things
                    from them, they had their allies in the United States who were accusing us of
                    the same thing. You had people, Catholics and Protestants, who remembered the
                    nuns case and all sorts of things, who couldn't resist the opportunity to beat
                    up once again on the Salvadoran government or on the American Embassy for
                    crimes, both real and imagined. We got beaten up a lot we did not hold back
                    information. We told people what we knew, when we knew it. I've gotten off the
                    subject again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the negotiations went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure. The other thing we had to do was very interesting. As
                    negotiations began to look more and more inevitable we began to find out that
                    people didn't know how to negotiate, so we took on an interesting and peculiar
                    role. We began to train the Salvadoran government and military to negotiate. We
                    held sessions at my residence. I don't know why they were always in the DCM
                    residence. I guess it just seemed to make sense somehow. Probably a less visible
                    place than the ambassador's residence. Joe Sullivan, then the DAS for Central
                    America, and Pete Romero, the Central America office director, often came down
                    from Washington to join the sessions. We got together the senior people in the
                    government and military who were going to be the negotiators. We sort o“gamed”
                    it through with them, and talked to them about how to organize their negotiation
                    team.</p>
                <p>In the United States we have a lot of experience with negotiations, but in
                    smaller countries like El Salvador they don't have experience with big
                    governmental organizations. Negotiations are two businessmen talking to each
                    other, or a businessman talking to some of his employees, or talking to a straw
                    boss who really provides his employees, and that is about it.</p>
                <p>We felt that the FMLN would come to the table pretty well prepared to negotiate
                    because they had their advisors too. We felt we had to spend enough time with
                    the government to bolster their confidence in their own negotiating ability, and
                    to make sure they didn't get taken to the cleaners either. It was also a
                    mechanism to get the military and civilian members of the government to work
                    together. They didn't talk to each other very well, either.</p>
                <p>On the government's side, it wasn't hard to convince them it was time for
                    negotiations. They were ready to follow Freddie Cristiani's lead on this. His
                    cabinet people were loyal to him. It took more convincing to get the military
                    confident enough to sit down with these civilians and begin to negotiate. There
                    is a tendency on the part of a lot of Americans, and on the part of people who
                    sort of don't like the military, to think of the military as very monolithic.
                    People who don't have much experience with the military, are fond of humor about
                    military people always blindly, and stupidly, following orders. They believe,
                    naively, that if the General says so, everybody will do it. Chain of command
                    discipline may be more prevalent in military organizations than among civilians,
                    but the fact is the senior leadership of the Salvadoran army could not simply
                    order army participation in the peace negotiations. They had to convince their
                    people to go along with them, and we had to help do it.</p>
                <p>If there was any favorable fallout from the Jesuit case it was that it further
                    discredited some of the reactionary senior officers in the Salvadoran military.
                    That left it to people in the military we knew pretty well. We didn't know some
                    of those recalcitrant right wingers very well anymore. They had separated
                    themselves from us.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>We were convinced the chief of staff of the Salvadoran army favored negotiations.
                    That was General Rene Emilio Ponce. Another officeGeneral Mauricio “Chato”
                    Vargaa member of the major opposition party, Fidel Chavez Mena's Christian
                    Democrats, and a few other people in the military, were also convinced that
                    negotiations were a possibility and that the war needed to end. At any rate, we
                    got these sessions together where we would sit them all together and we would
                    sort of play the FMLN.</p>
                <p>In the first session we spent some time on how to organize negotiations. We found
                    the only people capable of doing the staff work for negotiationpreparing
                    position papers that were really thought through and vetted throughout the
                    organizatiowere the military. The foreign minister just didn't enough staff, nor
                    the right staff, to do that kind of job. The military had enough of a general
                    staff concept to make them capable of preparing position papers. So by default
                    it was the military, basically under the leadership of General Vargas, who
                    really took on the task of doing the staff work for the negotiations.</p>
                <p>We had a number of these sessions and I think they did help. In the first place
                    they helped solidify both the military and civilian units into a team charged
                    with the negotiations. Secondly, they developed the government's confidence in
                    going into negotiations. Again, these are New World folks who go into
                    negotiation situations thinking they are going to get screwed by the other side.
                    At some poin(it's almost four o'clock) I have to talk about the role of the U.S.
                    Mil group, because it is a story in itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point? Do you want to make a
                        summary of where we were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I'm beginning to talk about the peace negotiations themselves, and our
                    preparations for those negotiations. An important part of that story is how the
                    U.S. MIL group related to the Salvadoran military during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something else, not on this, but in the generic thing, I
                        would like in our next session to talk about Salvadoran migration to the
                        United States. Okay, we'll pick this up then at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is the 5th of February 2000. Jeff, why don't we talk about the role of the
                    U.S. MIL group as these negotiations are going on?</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: The MIL group, I felt, was going to be a problem as we began to ease
                    out of combat into negotiations. I need to go back a bit. When I arrived in El
                    Salvador it was a period of transition in U.S. policy from one of military
                    support for the Salvadoran government, the prevention of a guerilla victory,
                    into one of encouraging peace negotiations and getting a settlement as soon as
                    possible. We have to have sympathy for the MIL group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had better explain what a MIL group is, as opposed to
                        attaches.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The attaches are part of the traditional military representation at
                    embassies. They maintain liaison with the military forces to handle joint issues
                    on a diplomatic level. They are our prime contacts with the military as a force
                    in local society, and they also fulfill an overt intelligence function. Their
                    job is to report back to Washington on the affairs of the military, just as
                    political sections report on the government's political life and USIS reports on
                    the press and public opinion.</p>
                <p>MIL groups, however, are set up with a specific mission of administering military
                    aid programs, both in terms of financial and material aid, and in terms of
                    advising, if that's in the package the United States contemplates for that
                    country.</p>
                <p>The MIL group in El Salvador, for obvious reasons, was very big. It had been
                    limited by an agreement between the Reagan administration and Congress to 55
                    military advisors, but this certainly did not mean the MIL group only
                    constituted 55 advisors and a boss. It had a whole lot of other people - I don't
                    remember the numbers now - who were in support functions. In other words, the
                    persons who ran the supply system for the military advisors and the command
                    structure for the military advisors, and the people who ran the military aid
                    portions and the military sales portions of the program - A big important group
                    - were in addition to the advisors. The advisors were the people who actually
                    trained and advised the Salvadoran military on a unit by unit basis in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>As I said, going in there, I felt there would be a problem of transitioning these
                    people from a combat mode into a peace negotiation mode. That was going to be a
                    complicated thing. I think you have to have sympathy for the advisors - these
                    are combat soldiers who were out there to train the Salvadoran military in what
                    they needed to know to more effectively pursue the war. One hoped they also
                    trained them in how to decently pursue the war. Sometimes they did but not
                    always. I felt the job for us - by us I mean the front office of the embassy -
                    would be to get them actually into the peace negotiations. In a sense there were
                    two alternatives. One, you could simply say, “We are now in a peace negotiation
                    period, and you folks are pretty much out of business, so just stay there and
                    don't do anything until we need you.” Or the other was to involve them in the
                    process.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>That second alternative was, of course, the best. In the first place, we were in
                    a negotiation situation while the war was still on, so the need for them to
                    continue training the Salvadorans toward more effectiveness was still there. On
                    the other hand, you had to cut down on the level of aggressiveness to a point
                    where it didn't impinge on the peace process. That is a very subtle thing and a
                    very subtle system to try to run with 55 persons who are at remote locations and
                    have only sporadic contact with their own headquarters.</p>
                <p>We were fortunate when we got into the period when negotiations really began to
                    get serious, to get a new MIL group commandea full colonel named Mark
                    Hamilton.</p>
                <p>The ambassador and I saw a lot of possibilities in Hamilton. He understood the
                    peace process and why it was important. He understood that war had run its
                    course and there was not much more to be gained by either side. The tactics the
                    ambassador and I used were those of saying, “Okay, Mark, and okay, you people
                    who work for him, you are not out of the process now. You are very much in the
                    process. The military is a part of the negotiation and you are part of the
                    negotiation.” I think that was the key. It's not a very American way to do
                    things. In our history we either do diplomacy or we do war, and when we are in a
                    war the State department shuts down in the theater of the war and the military
                    runs it. Anyway, we tried for a more sophisticated approach. To make a long
                    story short, as we got down to the “end game” in the peace process, the Col.
                    Hamilton and the MIL group began to play a key role in the negotiations.</p>
                <p>More importantly, the effective senior level of the Salvadoran military, led by
                    Colonel Ponce, really became partisans of the peace process. They became
                    negotiators, they took risks. The peace negotiations were not popular among the
                    Salvadoran military. Many of them still had the feeling they could win and felt
                    that their honor was bound up in winning. It took a lot of leadership for people
                    like Ponce and Vargas to begin to turn this thing around and to in effect start
                    to convince the people, to get them to say, “There is honor in bringing peace to
                    this country. That's our job now.” Mark Hamilton had a lot to do with
                    influencing these people toward that goal.</p>
                <p>After the November '89 offensive the peace negotiations became much more
                    inevitable. At that point the guerillas were convinced they could not win at any
                    cost they were willing to pay. The military were convinced they could not wipe
                    out the guerillas at a cost they were willing to pay. Some of the senior people
                    were getting pretty sick of going to funerals and the commitment of the
                    Salvadoran government, led by President Cristiani, became even stronger after
                    the offensive finally ended. This had to stop - El Salvador had to find a new
                    way to do things.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>It's too long ago for me to go into details on negotiations, but a lot of it had
                    to do with “how does El Salvador absorb all these people who had made their
                    living fighting a war” on both sides? That required a very sympathetic
                    understanding of that problem. There were too many people in the United States
                    that said, “Oh, they were just soldiers anyway, and they shouldn't have been
                    soldiers in the first place, so if they are miserable now they are getting what
                    is coming to them.” That is not a way to achieve peace; it is also inhumane. A
                    lot of peace negotiations have had to do with finding ways to assure demobilized
                    people on both sides that they would be able to make a living. That kind of
                    transaction requires good leadership on both sides.</p>
                <p>To sort of symbolize how important the MIL group became in those negotiations I
                    have to go to the end of it all. In December the negotiations moved to the
                    United Nations in New York. Big delegations from both sides went up. Tom
                    Pickering was at the UN at that point and he was an ex U.S. ambassador to El
                    Salvador, but, nevertheless, things were not going well.</p>
                <p>I have to go back. I have to flash back to another story. Sometime, I guess
                    probably in the late summer of '90, Ambassador Walker decided we needed to make
                    some symbolic gesture, and I don't like the word gesture because I am talking
                    something more important than a gesture, but we had to find a symbolic way of
                    signaling to the guerillas our support of the peace process and a peace
                    agreement which would insure a decent well being for them. He decided to visit
                    the FMLN at their headquarters.</p>
                <p>He got agreement from Washington to go. It was not easy, because such a visit was
                    seen as very risky by some and by others as something you never should do until
                    after a peace agreement or at least at a much later stage in the process. But
                    the department and the White House wisely decided this was the time to use such
                    a visit to jump start the negotiations.</p>
                <p>So, Bill Walker made his trip to visit the guerillas. I would have given a lot to
                    go along, but DCMs stay home under those circumstances. He did take Mark
                    Hamilton with him. Mark did good work, both in terms of his liaison with the
                    Salvador military and by developing ties with military leaders during that visit
                    on the guerilla side. He was the classic big, tall, physically fit, gringo
                    colonel that everybody thinks soldiers are supposed to look like. He was very
                    articulate and a good talker and he brought it off. He was very helpful in
                    convincing military people on both the government and guerilla side that a peace
                    agreement was inevitable and that the United States would be supportive of
                    people involved in the process.</p>
                <p>The visit was a big success. It allowed us, especially Ambassador Walker, to
                    establish contacts on both sides of the negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>Now we can go back to December. These very difficult negotiations had moved to
                    New York with the show being run by Tom Pickering, who was himself an ex
                    ambassador to El Salvador. At one point during the negotiations, getting close
                    to Christmas time, we got a call from Pickering saying, “I've got problems with
                    the military folks on both sides of this thing. I need Mark Hamilton up here.”
                    Mark was up in his office and I got him downstairs and we went to talk to the
                    ambassador and told Mark he had to go to New York. Mark's reaction was the
                    usual, “Yes sir, I'm ready to go.” I think we had a plane ready to go in about a
                    half an hour, and Mark was out of the door and on the way to the airport. It was
                    only later, when Walker and I were talking, we realized that Mark had taken off
                    for New York in December wearing khaki trousers and a short sleeve sport shirt.
                    I don't really know the details of the role he played in New York. He described
                    it as spending a lot of time talking to people when asked to do so.</p>
                <p>On New Years Eve of 1991, we got an agreement. I was at a big New Years Eve party
                    with a lot of prominent Salvadorans and the news came through during the party
                    that a peace agreement had been achieved.</p>
                <p>This is probably the time to look at an assessment of ten years of U.S. policy.
                    It had started as a policy designed to prevent a Marxist takeover in yet another
                    Latin American country. As I mentioned before, our cover story took over and the
                    policy morphed into a search for a democratic solution for El Salvador. After
                    ten years we finally had a formula, by no means perfect, but one that might
                    work.</p>
                <p>The people who had fought on the rebel side were guaranteed a place in the
                    political life of the country. The country, out of the crucible of war, had in a
                    sense reorganized itself in ways that would make it unlike everything that had
                    gone before. There was a different political setup - not perfect, not capable of
                    solving the country's economic problems but a system that involved a great deal
                    more participation by the citizens of that country in their own political life.
                    The differences between the political El Salvador at the end of that war and at
                    the beginning were marked. El Salvador was changed. People are still poor, and
                    people still treat each other badly every now and then but, believe me, it is
                    not the same country it was before.</p>
                <p>The policy experience for the United States was also interesting. If you look at
                    it and compare El Salvador and Nicaragua, there is a total difference in way the
                    U.S. policy was pursued in the two countries. The Nicaragua policy, especially
                    in its Contra manifestation, was one that tried for quick solutions by trying to
                    manufacture things in the Nicaraguan political situation that really could not
                    be supported without the Americans. It required a great deal of covert action
                    and support of inappropriate allies over which we didn't have much control.
                    There was a lot wrong with it, mainly because it relied too heavily on covert
                    activities and tried for a quick transformation that, at best, would have been
                    superficial. In the end, Nicaragua solved its own problems through its own
                    elections.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>The Salvador policy was very expensive, but it was essentially a public policy.
                    Everybody knew we were giving military aid to El Salvador. Everybody knew how
                    much it was. It was debated at least once a year, and sometimes twice, in the
                    U.S. Congress. And it barely, but consistently, received the support it needed.
                    In the end, it worked better. I don't want to say there weren't any covert
                    activities in El Salvador; there were some, but they were mainly in the category
                    of intelligence gathering and not in political manipulation and dumb dirty
                    tricks. Where I come down is that public policy, acknowledged policy, and public
                    commitment over the long term, works. Clandestine, quick fix, James Bond type
                    solutions really don't work. Even when they appear to work, they backfire on
                    you. We got away with it in Guatemala in the fifties and then we paid the price
                    for years and years after.</p>
                <p>The Guatemala coup was the second worst thing we had to cope with in Latin
                    America in terms of bad policy. The first one was holding on to the Panama Canal
                    too long. As things began to wind down in El Salvador, the target country of
                    those people in absolute disagreement with U.S. policy in Latin America then
                    became Guatemala. I think Salvador/Nicaragua contrast shows where U.S. policy
                    worked well and where it doesn't work well.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the estimate you and Ambassador Walker were getting about the El
                    Salvador leadership? You get the leadership where people have learned to live by
                    the gun.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It is very much a leadership phenomena.</p>
                <p>I think you have to understand that the attraction of war, and particularly in
                    Latin America. Think of the alternatives available to an 18 year old from the
                    countryside or the urban underclass. If he sees his alternative is selling
                    chewing gum on the streets of San Salvador or washing car windows, or petty
                    theft or working the fields, he may well conclude that joining the guerillas or
                    the army is a good choice. The guerillas seems kind of fun for a young person.
                    He gets to go on a permanent camping trip. He gets to play with guns. He gets to
                    do a lot of things that are fun and, in some ways, life in the guerilla camps
                    was probably healthier. It was a better life for young people than living on the
                    streets of the city.</p>
                <p>Or if his choice was the army rather then the guerillas at least he had security
                    and a minimal living and he got to play with guns. In both cases, with the army
                    or the guerillas, there was a sense of identity, of belonging and a channel for
                    youthful idealism. I am not ignoring the fact that in both cases he stood a
                    pretty good chance of getting killed. I guess kids really do think they are
                    immortal.</p>
                <p>Also take the case of a lower middle class kid with some education, but little
                    else going for him. He may well see a commission in the army as his ticket into
                    the upper middle class. The pay isn't very good, but the opportunities for a
                    little, or a lot, extra on the side are there for everyone to see. In much of
                    Latin America, the military is a path to upward mobility and there aren't very
                    many others. And the guerillas too had their appeal for the educated poor.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>When you start saying to these people who have been soldiers for all their adult
                    lives, “There is a better civilian life ahead for you that can come out of a
                    peace agreement,” you are facing a hell of a problem. In the first place, they
                    have no precedent for it. And secondly, the message is coming from people they
                    instinctively don't trust - civilian politicians and the American embassy.</p>
                <p>It took a lot of commitment and a lot of leadership on the part of the Salvadoran
                    government, the Salvadoran military, and us to convince people that there was a
                    possibility that things could be okay. I don't think we ever convinced many of
                    the military people on either side that things would be great, but they were
                    probably getting pretty tired themselves of risking their lives and even more
                    tired of seeing their friends blown away and going to funerals. I think both the
                    army and the guerillas were getting tired of the alienation from their own
                    society that was setting in. The stories of massacres, the human rights
                    violations, did alienate the people from the military of both sides. You have to
                    remember, the guerillas also indulged in their human rights violations and did
                    things like shooting down unarmed American helicopter crewmen and all sorts of
                    other things. There were a lot of victims on both sides.</p>
                <p>I think you have to give Bill Walker a lot of credit for having managed his
                    relationship with the senior level of the Salvadoran government with great
                    skill. You also have to recognize that President Cristiani came into the process
                    with a commitment to peace, and did not waver from that vision. He was building
                    on a base laid down by Duarte who also had a vision not only of peace, but of
                    transformation in the politics of El Salvador. I think Cristiani was the better
                    politician and the better leader of the two. Duarte really didn't fulfill the
                    kind of promise that he held out for a while. I think Cristiani succeeded even
                    better than we thought he would. His accomplishment was a leadership
                    accomplishment. He came out of a party that was trusted by his social class, but
                    not trusted by the rest of the country, a party with an unfortunate heritage,
                    which he transformed.</p>
                <p>Q: He also had the American press, which was important in this effort. They were
                    highly skeptical because of where he was coming from.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were, too. I mentioned that I had to actually meet him before I was
                    convinced there was substance behind him. What you are always afraid of is that
                    a new Salvadoran leader would say good things about the peace process because he
                    thought that was what the Americans wanted to hear, but he wasn't really going
                    to do it. I think a lot of hard liners in Cristiani's ARENA party were comforted
                    by the thought that he was just kidding about peace.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>You have to give credit to people on both sides of the war for having gotten
                    aboard the peace process, and in doing so, admitted a lot of the things they had
                    done in the past were wrong. You had to give that kind of credit to General
                    Ponce and some others. There is a certain irony in the Truth Commission process
                    that was part of the peace agreement. The leaders in place got burned. They got
                    burned because, in the interest of the peace process, they talked about their
                    own past and talked about past mistakes. That happened to some of the guerilla
                    leaders, too. A lot of the people who had done many worse things just kept
                    silent because they could since they weren't leaders anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern on Walker's and your part that, knowing
                        the way the American government works, once a problem is supposedly solved,
                        interest, finance, support - the whole thing goes away and we are off
                        worrying about something else. Were we making promises in this peace process
                        that might atrophy it over time because of lack of American interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We knew that was a risk. In 1994, I happened to meet with a subsequent
                    Salvadoran president in Mexico, and he certainly felt the United States had not
                    provided the aid it should have and that had been promised. We are not so dumb
                    that we just pulled out. We did keep up aid levels and we did support the peace
                    process. A lot of what I did after the peace agreement - Bill Walker left
                    shortly after things were signed and I was charge d'affaires for about five
                    months, from January through June - a lot of it did have to do with getting a
                    lot of people in contact so we could fulfill those promises. Getting
                    entrepreneurs to sit down with guerilla leadership and talk about employment,
                    jobs, education, scholarships, and getting all sorts of counterpart groups to
                    meet with each other. As is often the case, the American embassy is a good venue
                    for that sort of thing. People tend to accept our invitations and tend to show
                    up. One of the things that surprised me was the extent to which military to
                    military relations went off very quickly and easily. There is something about
                    soldiers that makes them like the idea of getting together with their ex
                    adversaries and talking shop. That happened quickly and became very cordial.</p>
                <p>The two groups that were most difficult continued to be the church leadership,
                    who I think still felt that somehow total justice had not been achieved in the
                    Jesuit case and a kind of think tank type group called CONACIT that kept
                    refusing to meet with anybody from the FMLM no matter what. The churcor at least
                    the local Jesuitremained somewhat hostile to the settlement. Both those groups
                    had their followers in the United States, which made it difficult. The CONACIT
                    people often had support from ultraconservative Americans who had been saying
                    all along, “You don't have to go along with this peace process, you people can
                    win.” The church received constant support, also from people in the United
                    States, who felt the other side should have won. A lot of American liberal
                    opinion didn't like the peace process very well because they thought their
                    friends should have won. A sense of justice meant that the guerillas should get
                    to run things now and the people who had supported the government should be on
                    the outs.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>Peacemaking has to do with compromise, and there were too many so called friends
                    of peace in the Salvadoran equation who really weren't for peace at all. They
                    were friends of peace only based on their side winning, and that wasn't going to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>I've gotten off the track again - your question was? Oh yes, I remember. It was
                    about the U.S. policy commitment. We worked hard on making the connections and
                    using what aid we had to get people jobs and to demobilize the military forces
                    on both sides decently. It certainly hasn't worked to perfection. El Salvador
                    still has too many unemployed ex combatants, and has had a major problem with
                    crime because there are too many people who were used to making their living
                    with guns. They continue to do so. If you learned the trade on the army side by
                    extorting support from villagers by intimidating them, or if you had earned your
                    living on the guerilla side by doing pretty much the same thing, it wasn't too
                    hard for some to transition into kidnaping, blackmail and theft. However, I
                    remain convinced the country was transformed into something better than what it
                    was before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking in Arlington, Virginia, right now in the
                        year 2000, and within five miles of us is a very large workforce of
                        immigrants from El Salvador. This is a new phenomena and concentrated in
                        this area. Spanish seems to be the language in most work sites. A lot of
                        people who look like Central American Indians are out there in hard hats.
                        During the time you were there, could you talk about legal illegal migration
                        flow in both ways. How did this affect you; how did you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I probably have to go back to the demographics of El Salvador. El
                    Salvador is an intensely overpopulated country, and that is uncharacteristic of
                    the rest of Latin America with the exception of Haiti. So there would have been
                    a major flow of immigration, legal and illegal, to the United States whether
                    there had been a war in El Salvador or not. But surely the war changed the
                    equation a lot. It increased the number of people who wanted or needed to leave
                    and it gave people who wanted to come anyway a pretty good case to be made that
                    they were escaping extreme danger and persecution. And because of that,
                    understandably enough, a lot of those people have figured out a way to stay. I
                    don't mean to be callous - there were many people who were genuine refugees from
                    the war, but there were also many who came for essentially economic reasons.
                    When you consider the terrible poverty of El Salvador, I personally find both
                    motives equally justified. The law however makes distinctions.</p>
                <p>It was a hard issue for the Salvadoran government to deal with. On the one level
                    you deal with a certain level of national pride and you don't like the idea that
                    your people are leaving. On the other hand, local economic pressure is relieved
                    and the emigrants send back lots of dollars.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>The problem for the Salvadoran government is that emigrants also represented a
                    major source of foreign exchange. Salvador did reasonably well as a coffee
                    exporter, but they probably earned more foreign exchange through remittances
                    than they ever did through coffee of any other export. The prospect of those
                    people being sent back, especially in large numbers over a short period of time,
                    was absolutely terrifying to the Salvadoran government. And absolutely
                    terrifying to any American official who had anything to do with the development
                    of the economy of that country. It would have been a disaster. The remittances
                    would stop and somebody would have to pick up the burden of trying to
                    reintegrate these people back into Salvadoran society.</p>
                <p>In the longer term I think it is economically damaging to the country. El
                    Salvador, like a lot of Latin American countries, probably has all the lawyers
                    it needs, and probably has all the engineers, and probably all the doctors it
                    needs, but what it doesn't have is all the nurses it needs, or all the
                    electricians it needs, or all the plumbers it needs, or all the airplane
                    mechanics it needs. Those people are hard to find. The problem of emigration to
                    the United States for many developing countries is that it filters off the best
                    of the folks who will become your nurses and technicians and mechanics. They are
                    the ones with the energy and guts, and maybe even the tiny amounts of capital
                    that need to be accumulated to make the move, so it is filtering off their best
                    and most useful workers. Thoughtful people in Latin American countries and El
                    Salvador understand that.</p>
                <p>That's as good a policy dilemma as the U.S. government can be confronted with. In
                    a way it's kind of a lose lose proposition for us, and when we have a lose lose
                    situation, and when we have immigration that is motivated by the fact that we
                    have economic need in this country of these people, we end up trying to do both
                    things at once.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under pressure to say that a particular person
                        was actually certified as a political refugee, did that get into your
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I'm probably going to show I didn't pay as much attention to the
                    consular section as I should have. Yes, I think we had to make that decision,
                    but when you have conditions of war prevailing all over the place, it becomes
                    kind of hard not to make that decision. If we had been very tough on those kinds
                    of decisions, we would have come under all sorts of pressure from various groups
                    in the United States. They would have taken us to the cleaners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the peace process went, did you foresee and worry about
                        all these refugees coming back - which was the last thing you needed - you
                        had to absorb all the military on both sides and you didn't need a bunch of
                        villagers coming back who were sending solid remittances in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, that was a worry, both for us and the Salvadoran government. You
                    had things like the amnesty provision that really were designed to keep that
                    from happening. The United States government took a number of administrative
                    actions, and some legislative ones too, that basically said, “No, that won't
                    happen to you and certainly not all at once. We've got to follow our laws and
                    some of these people are no longer going to be qualified as refugees and will
                    have to come back, but we will do it gradually.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was something you were working on. What about the
                        upper class, were they getting the hell ou- the doctors, dentists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The Salvadoran rich always hedged their bets by keeping funds in
                    Europe or the United States and having property other places. The upper class in
                    El Salvador were the kind of people who are very at home in Miami if they need
                    to be. A large number of them study in the United States. I don't want to give
                    the impression that the upper class abandoned El Salvador during the war,
                    because they pretty much stayed there. There were some people who fell into
                    particular danger, either from guerillas or their own politicians, or from the
                    right wing, who did go and live in the United States. There were some who came
                    back during the negotiations and peace process.</p>
                <p>The Salvadoran upper class has had it good enough in El Salvador that they are
                    fairly motivated to come back, and part of the peace process was assuring them
                    that their lives would not be disrupted.</p>
                <p>Land reform had already been done - was already a fact of life and people had
                    gotten used to the fact that they had lost big haciendas. They had also gotten
                    used to the idea that having a big, inefficient hacienda wasn't the way to
                    prosper in the world anyway. You had to turn your resources toward industry,
                    commerce or services, or you had to learn to do modern agriculture. Again,
                    education was really important, because the U.S. education of the sons of the
                    early twentieth century landowning class was exactly the window that opened on
                    better ways of making a living. I give credit to that new generation of young
                    U.S. educated Salvadorans. They had a different vision of how the country could
                    progress and maybe this explains a lot of their politics.</p>
                <p>It was a vision that was acceptable to their parents. They are not persons who
                    rebelled against their families and all their traditions, but had modified
                    everything in ways that were acceptable and made sense to them. Ultimately, this
                    is the way most human beings treat their forefathers. You do things that are
                    sort of what they had in mind, but not really.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>The immigration issue was a big part of the peace process and had to be solved,
                    and within the possibilities of our laws the United States government got it
                    pretty much right by avoiding any kind of precipitous repatriation of
                    Salvadorans. I tend to believe now there never will be a precipitous
                    repatriation of Salvadorans. Basically, they are here, and in my estimate in the
                    long term will be good for us. That, of course is too bad for El Salvador,
                    because they could use a lot of those people. From Salvador's point, they should
                    get back all the energetic, ambitious Salvadorans that are here and send us some
                    of the ones they still have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, did you see church
                        delegations - particularly Catholic Church delegations - were they coming in
                        all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Both Catholic and Protestant. I've talked about the policy of the
                    embassy and how delegations got received. Whatever the delegation, they were
                    received by the embassy and we spent a lot of time with them. Church
                    delegations, both Catholic and Protestant, were a staple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during the peace process, was there a different
                        tenor to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A lot of the church people really bothered me during that period,
                    because there were too many of them who wanted the side they favored to win.
                    They would say, and believe, they were for peace, but the formula they saw for
                    peace was one that could only have been achieved through a guerilla victory. So
                    a lot of them were a little sour on the peace process because they saw it as a
                    “selling out” of values they felt were very important.</p>
                <p>I guess some of them thought the Salvadoran economy ought to be reorganized along
                    lines that would take most of the wealth away from the folks that had it and
                    give it to other people. They didn't seem to quite understand that the
                    Salvadoran rich, and the not so rich, would fight to keep what they had, just as
                    people would do in this country. Wanting your side to win, no matter how noble
                    the motives, was not the way to achieve peace in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>A lot of people, especially outsiders, expressed their desires with the formula
                    “peace with justice.” In the long term, it's a good slogan. The two words belong
                    together; you probably cannot have one without the other. But in the shorter
                    term, achieving peace with justice required compromise on justice. And a higher
                    level of justice would have meant compromising on peace. In war weary El
                    Salvador peace was the priority. Salvadorans and, for that matter, most
                    Americans who cared about the country more than political abstractions, wanted
                    the killing to stop.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>Whether they like to admit it or not, church people and American and European
                    liberals provided a whole lot of military aid to the Salvadoran guerillas. I
                    think many of them sincerely believed that aid was only going for humanitarian
                    purposes. But since they filtered their aid through the major guerilla
                    organizations, it defies all human logic to say that it didn't go for military
                    purposes. The guerilla leadership would had to have been saintly, and they
                    certainly weren't, to avoid the temptation of using it to support their military
                    operations. They would also have needed sophisticated and expensive cost
                    accounting systems.</p>
                <p>The fact is a lot of people had an investment in the guerilla side and had been
                    deliberately trying to countervail U.S. aid. Having failed to influence congress
                    to cut the aid off, they decided to countervail.</p>
                <p>There was also a great deal of naivet? on both sides, if naive means you are
                    unacquainted with how things really work. One of the statements that used to
                    drive me nuts was when somebody would come and tell me some horrible thing that
                    had happened (sometimes true we would find out) and then they would say, “This
                    must be true because a poor person told me.” I have never understood that logic.
                    Surely they don't believe poor people can't shade the truth like everybody else
                    does when it is in their interest. They should understand that the downtrodden
                    of the world are really good at verbal manipulation of people who don't know
                    very much about their situation. It is often the only defense they have against
                    exploiters.</p>
                <p>I think maybe the idea was sort of “these people have been so badly mistreated
                    that at least we owe them the courtesy of believing them.” The people of El
                    Salvador are owed great courtesy, but that is no way to do politics, nor
                    organize a society. That kind of attitude and that kind of reporting made
                    sometimes made it difficult for the embassy to sort out what really had
                    happened. And bad facts will trump compromise every time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, how was the guerilla leadership?
                        Were they in town and working? I'm talking about the top echelon now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: They were there for the negotiations which happened in various places,
                    usually not in San Salvador. They were certainly in town right after the peace
                    agreement. I remember a number of occasions when Ambassador Walker and Phil
                    Chicola, the political counselor, and I as well a couple of other people from
                    the embassy, would sit down for quiet face to face sessions with members of the
                    guerilla leadership, even before the peace agreement. We would sit and talk and
                    reminisce about old times, and talk about the future and try to bolster their
                    interest in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel you were supported, in the last year of
                        the peace process, by the Bureau? You had a pretty hard line bureau at one
                        point because of domestic politics but things changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: We were well supported by the bureau. There was no question of Bernie
                    Aronson's commitment to the peace process, nor his understanding of it and how
                    it would work. When we had disagreements with them, they were tactical
                    disagreements. After all, they weren't talking to the same people in Washington
                    that we were talking to locally. They had to respond to pressure groups in
                    Washington, too. Bernie Aronson is the one who had to deal with Helm's staff on
                    one hand, and Chris Dodd's staff on the other. He had to deal with the Jesuits
                    at Georgetown, who had a legitimate concern about the Jesuit case. I don't fault
                    the bureau at all in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Ollie North business, there was a disengagement
                        of the NSC (National Security Council) from being as much of an active
                        participant in this as it began to wind down. Did you see any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, I think so, but I wasn't in a very good position to see that. I
                    think the NSC had reverted to its traditional mode of being a not very good
                    coordinator instead of trying to be its own agency. I wouldn't want to leave the
                    impression that the Ollie North scandal kick started the peace process - peace
                    in El Salvador as a U.S. policy. That had its origins long before the Ollie
                    North got caught, bit its implementation was complicated by the fact that we
                    were trying to run much of the logistics for Nicaragua out of El Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this latter part we are talking about, what was
                        happening in Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, we were into the period of the elections. The Contra adventure
                    was over and they were scattered in various places. They were still there as a
                    political force but not much of a military force anymore. The elections in
                    Nicaragua were held in late '91, and guess what. Violeta Chamorro won. That
                    tells you something about democracy and the power of the press. She was an
                    important person because of what happened to her husband - he was important
                    because he was a journalist. Of course the defeat of the Sandinistas electorally
                    in Nicaragua was one more element telling the Salvadoran rebels that it was time
                    to sue for peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Towards the end, did you feel the Cubans were a
                        factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I don't think the Cubans have ever been the factor in Latin America
                    that we thought they were. No, they weren't a factor. The Latin Americans know
                    if a leftist gets into trouble he can go live in Cuba. It is a place of refuge.
                    Cuba has probably had more influence on Mexico that it ever had on any Central
                    American country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should discuss before we move
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Let me go back to immigration policy. There was one really sad thing
                    where U.S. policy did not jibe very well with Salvadoran policy. There was a
                    case when the Salvadorans intercepted a ship at sea and took off 30 or 40
                    Chinese that were headed for the United States and incarcerated them in El
                    Salvador. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying something about Cristiani's chief of
                        staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Cristiani's chief of staff said, “Here are these Chinese, would you
                    please take them because they were headed for your country anyway.” I said we
                    would have to talk to Washington about it. I don't think we ever did take them.
                    We kept telling the Salvadorans that it was their problem. An annoyed Arturo
                    Tona would come to me and say, “Look, we're getting tired of feeding these
                    people, this is really terrible. Next time we are just going to let them go.” To
                    tell you the truth, I don't know what finally happened to the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '92 you left. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: To Mexico. I had been negotiating on this, and the department had
                    discussed another DCM job with me. I finally decided, after a lot of thought,
                    maybe I would just as soon go back to USIA because I had also been offered the
                    PAO job in Mexico. The DCM assignments involved were Argentina and Brazil, both
                    countries I had served in, and I decided I would like to go to a country I
                    hadn't served in. I could see the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement)
                    thing coming. I decided Mexico might be an interesting country to be in, and it
                    was one of the biggest USIS posts. I thought with the coming integration of USIA
                    into the State Department it was time to be back there. Frankly, in those days,
                    running a USIS post offered you a lot more independence than being a DCM
                    again.</p>
                <p>My family, always an important consideration, my wife especially, was very
                    enthusiastic about going to Mexico. She had been in Mexico City a couple of
                    times and had liked it a lot. Certain family considerations, aging parents and
                    our involvement up on Lake Erie, where we had our summer place, also made the
                    idea of being close to the United States very attractive.</p>
                <p>We left El Salvador in June because my wife needed some surgery. She had gone
                    through routine physicals, the doctor in Salvador had discovered a tumor and
                    recommended that we get back to the States quickly. I probably would have left
                    in July anyway, but I ended up leaving in late May or early June. It was scary.
                    It was not something we had ever had to face before, and it turned out to be a
                    fairly routine. You are never really confident until you get back to doctors in
                    the States, so I left Salvador a little earlier than I had intended.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>I was kind of sad, because it had been fun being charge for five months (Bill
                    Walker had left in Late January or early February) and I had liked it a lot.
                    There was a wonderful farewell party in the new embassy residence. That's
                    another story I never got into - the building of a new embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you talk about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, that's a big story, a big embassy. It was interesting in how we
                    worked. But just let me finish up on the farewell.</p>
                <p>It was very touching because there were people there who represented everybody we
                    had dealt with. The guerilla leadership was there. Certainly during the first
                    part of my tour at least, I never expected the guerilla leadership would turn up
                    at my farewell party. Important military people were there, plus the government
                    was well represented. It was a nice farewell and I think it was a way for
                    Salvadorans, at five or six months into the peace process, to recognize the role
                    the United States had played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thing that keeps coming through to me as I do these
                        interviews, is how important the role of the United States is. If we aren't
                        the engine in certain areas, acting as a facilitator, nothing will happen.
                        With all our blunders the world would probably be a hell of a lot more
                        chaotic than it is today without American participation and a certain amount
                        of leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think so. As president of the USIA Alumni Association, I had to
                    write a letter to the White House on Sunday and I used the phrase “the world
                    often requests, and always expects, American leadership.”</p>
                <p>The mechanism of an embassy is particularly useful. There is still considerable
                    and broad respect for the traditions of diplomacy. Even if we have policies that
                    are not particularly neutral at times, the embassy often represents neutral
                    ground where you can get people together. If you have people so hardened that
                    they won't accept an invitation to the American embassy, don't worry too much
                    about it - they probably aren't going to negotiate anyway.</p>
                <p>Oh, back to the new embassy in El Salvador. We probably took a snapshot somewhere
                    around the mid '80s on what would be needed for an Inman standard embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You better explain who Bob Inman was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I hope I've got that right. Robert Inman was - I don't remember what
                    he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a brilliant military man, who was head of the
                        National Security Agency for sometime. At one point he was nominated to be
                        secretary of defense. A brilliant sort of engineer type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: He had done a study of what would be necessary for embassy security.
                    If there was ever a place where you had to think about building a secure embassy
                    it was El Salvador.</p>
                <p>There was a shooting war of very serious dimensions going on at the time the
                    Department did its initial surveys. In essence, they took a snapshot of the
                    situation that prevailed at that time, and planned to build what we needed. This
                    involved a huge campus like setting on the edge of San Salvador. The location
                    itself eventually became a mini problem because someone discovered that,
                    technically, it wasn't in the capital city, and the U.S. embassy, according to
                    the U.S. El Salvador treaty establishing diplomatic relations, was supposed to
                    be located in the capital city. But in good Central American fashion somebody
                    said, “Oh, to hell with it, don't worry about it.”</p>
                <p>We ended up with this huge campus like setting. The embassy and its out buildings
                    ended up looking like some well funded Bible college. The huge lot had two big
                    super reinforced towers going up six or seven floors each and various
                    outbuildings - marine barracks and various other things - and all sorts of
                    fences around it. It was a fairly generous facility for things as they stood in
                    '83 and '84 when they took the snapshot. It wasn't completed until early '92. By
                    that time we had a peace agreement, and it was already evident that it was a lot
                    bigger than it needed to be. It also included an ambassador's residence; so you
                    had the two towers, the two chancery buildings, one being AID and the other
                    being everybody else, plus the ambassador's residence pretty close by, close
                    enough so that people began to worry about folks working in the embassy being
                    able to look into the ambassador's back yard.</p>
                <p>At any rate, it was a whole lot of work for the embassy. We were supervising a
                    major construction project as everything else was going on: dealing with
                    contractors, getting them into and out of the country, which was a major concern
                    when we had to evacuate people during the offensive. A lot of the work had to be
                    done by American contractors. It was done to a super standard. As somebody said,
                    “It will never fall down during an earthquakit might capsize, but it won't fall
                    down.” It was bombproof, with lots of separation from the street.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>When we finally got it built, it was evident that it was too big. It certainly
                    was going to be too big if American policy was to be successful at all in El
                    Salvador. Even with hindsight, you can look back and ask how we could have
                    turned it off. In any construction project there is a point of no return where
                    you may has well go ahead and finish it, and that had long passed before we got
                    a peace agreement, so the only big mistake in the construction is the two towers
                    are so close together that you couldn't sell off one of them without violating
                    the standards for separation from other facilities. I guess what it really
                    shows, and something to think about as we deal with Admiral Crowe's and other
                    admirals' recommendations on embassy security, is that it isn't quite as simple
                    as simply setting standards and then adhering to them. Construction of buildings
                    has to be guided by political considerations, like everything else we do.</p>
                <p>It is really a nice facility and very nice offices. On last day on the job in
                    Salvador we dedicated the new building. I guess we had one later on when the
                    VIPs came down, but we had our own because it was the day the last elements of
                    the embassy were moving in. I made a little speech, the marines were there with
                    flags, and a couple of other people made speeches. The day before, all my
                    household effects had been packed out and I went in there as charge, plopped
                    myself down in this sort of very luxurious and essentially empty ambassador's
                    office and sat there for about half an hour, thought about El Salvador and
                    everything else. Then I figured I didn't have a hell of a lot more to do there,
                    so I decided to go home and pack my suitcase and I left the next morning.</p>
                <p>Now Mexico. Well, I went back for a long home leave, and my wife's surgery
                    happened in July and was fine. My son was then just about to enter junior high
                    school, and that had been a consideration too, on going to Mexico because the
                    school in Mexico was fine. Anyway, we went on a long home leave and there was an
                    additional delay, because my medical clearance got screwed up by a local
                    technician in Ohio who had done the lung capacity test incorrectly. If there is
                    anything they worry about when they send you to Mexico, is your lung capacity.
                    It was well into September before we got to Mexico City.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in '92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from '92 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Until December of '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were going as public affairs officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, as public affairs officer which made me the head of one of the
                    biggest USIS posts in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this would be a good place to stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That way we can concentrate on Mexico. What did you do
                        after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: After Mexico (we are close to the end) I came back and worked on
                    pickup jobs in the agency for a year and then I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is better to do it in one piece. We'll pick
                        this up as public affairs officer from '92 to '95 in Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>By the way, one of the questions I like to ask about is - here you came back
                    after a very fruitful time, after a major peace negotiation and other things -
                    did you get a feeling of people patting you on the back and saying “job well
                    done, Jeff “, or anything like that?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, not at that time, but I wouldn't emphasize that. The fact is there
                    any great sense o“hey, job well done,” but you have to remember that El Salvador
                    isn't very far away and there was a lot of interchange. Joe Sullivan and Pete
                    Romero were in and out of the country a lot. We were up in the States fairly
                    often. It only took us two or three hours to fly to Washington, it was no big
                    deal.</p>
                <p>I don't think there was a need for extensive debriefings. They knew everything I
                    knew already because we had been talking to each other all the time. The great
                    advantage of Latin America - same time zone. That makes a huge difference.</p>
                <p>There are two factors that make doing diplomacy in Latin America absolutely
                    different from the rest of the world. One is easy language, one that we do
                    pretty well. Second, real time. I don't remember any extensive sessions. I went
                    in and touched bases with everybody and I had been up here many times. One time
                    I was angling for some sort of job in the department, and either didn't get them
                    or I didn't want them. There was no need for consultations at that time. I had
                    no feeling that I was not appreciated in the department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll put at the end here that we will pick it up in
                        '92 to '95 when you are public affairs officer in Mexico City.</hi>
                </p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is the 9th of March, 2000. You were in Mexico City from when to when?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I was in Mexico from '92 to '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of our relations, as you saw them at
                        that time, with Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was a pretty good period. The Salinas government was interested in
                    an economic change in Mexico and interested in change in the way Mexico viewed
                    itself. There was a turn toward free enterprise and also a turn toward good
                    relations with the United States. The most important single fact, and one that
                    encouraged me to go there, was that we were in the NAFTA period, specifically
                    the period that led up to NAFTA being submitted to the U.S. Senate for
                    approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was an agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico that
                    would do away with the major economic barriers of trade among the three
                    countries. It was an important concept; an important event; one that recognized
                    a fact of absolutely basic geography that a lot of Americans sort of slide by,
                    that Mexico is indeed a part of North America, as well as being a part of Latin
                    America. The decision to go to Mexico was in some aspects a very good one, from
                    my point of view. I discovered, somewhat to my surprise, that I liked Mexico a
                    lot and I hadn't expected to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to that, you were in El Salvador weren't you? Had
                        you picked up southerner's concepts of their big neighbor to the north?
                        Mexico stands off to one side in the Latin American circle.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, to some extent. Mexico in a sense, sees itself too close to the
                    United States. You know the old joke about poor Mexico, so far from God and so
                    close to the United States, which is a reference to the anti-clericalism of the
                    Mexican revolution. I don't think the rest of Latin America sees it that way.
                    They see Mexico as a serious regional power; they see Mexico as a major provider
                    of those services that relate to the fact that it is a part of Latin America and
                    it also speaks Spanish. I guess Mexico, in terms of population, is the second,
                    or the largest Spanish speaking country in the world. It has a great influence
                    in the rest of Latin America, especially in media terms. Mexican television is a
                    major producer of entertainment programing for all of the Spanish speaking
                    world. That gives it a great deal of influence. The same is true of publication;
                    Mexican newspapers are influential in the rest of Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1973 or '74, I watched a dubbed version of a Mexican
                        soap opera that was showing on Russian television. This was in Kyrgyzstan of
                        all places. It was about a peasant girl that went to the big city and her
                        problems there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It's a curious thing because Mexican, as well as Argentine and
                    Brazilian soap operas do pretty well in Europe. Also some places in Asia too,
                    it's a curious phenomenon. If you go back, Dallas was one of the big, big
                    American successes in terms of international distribution of dubbed versions; I
                    think it had to do with family structure. The extended family structure of
                    Mexico looks familiar in much of southern Europe and eastern Europe, and looks
                    familiar in much of Asia.</p>
                <p>The Mexicans, as well as the Brazilians, are very good marketers. Early in my
                    stay there, John Negroponte and I went to call on the Director of Televisa and
                    as we were waiting in the lobby to go in and see the great man, a Russian came
                    up to the ambassador and greeted him like a long lost brother'. It turned out he
                    was the ex Russian ambassador in Mexico, who had returned to Mexico and gone to
                    work for Televisa in charge of marketing their programming to Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: John Negroponte. He was then replaced about mid tour for me by Jim
                    Jones, ex congressman from Oklahoma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the USIA apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: The USIA apparatus was big, it was one of our biggest posts in the
                    world, which included three branch posts, Guadalajara, Monterey, and Tijuana,
                    although we didn't call the one in Tijuana a branch post for bureaucratic
                    reasons, but at any rate we had an office in Tijuana. We also were in charge of
                    the Benjamin Franklin Library, which is the United States' oldest overseas
                    library. It is an important institution in Mexico City.</p>
                <p>We had a very large cultural program, based on the fact that the Mexican
                    government is, by tradition and by inclination, very heavily into cultural
                    affairs of all kinds. The foreign ministry has a large cultural division and
                    even runs its own cultural centers in other cities of Mexico. Mexico heavily
                    subsidizes orchestras, theater groups, and literary activities. It also a large
                    cultural center in San Antonio, which is really a branch of the UNAM, Mexico
                    city's autonomous University. It is a very serious operation.</p>
                <p>What this means is that Mexico was very interested in cultural relations on an
                    official level with the United States. That is difficult because we often don't
                    see much of a governmental role in our cultural heritage. Nevertheless, in many
                    ways, over the years, we have adapted to the Mexican model through mechanisms
                    like the Fulbright program.</p>
                <p>Mexico is one of what USIA in those days called a “commission country,” which
                    means that the Fulbright program is run through a governmental bilateral
                    agreement and governed by a board of directors appointed by both governments. It
                    was a big program and Mexico contributed half of the funding. That involved a
                    major amount of my time. It also meant that, in addition to a board of directors
                    to run, there was a separate Fulbright Commission office with its staff of 6 or
                    7 people and an executive director named by the board. The Fulbright Commission
                    staff administered the Fulbright program, which meant nominating and preparing
                    Mexican students to go to the United States and nominating and preparing
                    Americans to come to Mexico, assigning them to various universities. It also
                    served as the student advising organization in collaboration with USIS. If a
                    Mexican student was interested in studying in the United States, the Fulbright
                    Commission was a place where he could go to find a collection of catalogs and to
                    get advice on what he or she would have to do, what it would cost, and how to
                    apply.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When one thinks about it, the American higher educational
                        system is incredible for an American to understand but for a foreigner, I
                        mean all of us have gone through this. There isn't a university or state
                        university - you have hundreds, probably thousands - all different, all with
                        strengths and weaknesses.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's why student advising services are terribly important, and I
                    hope after the merger of USIA with the department we can find ways to continue
                    those services. In the first place, you are absolutely right. Most countries
                    find it difficult to fathom the U.S. university system because it is more highly
                    privatized than any other system in the world. There is no system, no set of
                    rules you can count on; no central place to apply. There is not even a clear cut
                    definition of what is prestigious and what isn't. A lot of what people advising
                    students would do would be to say, “Look, you don't have to go to Harvard or
                    Yale to study in the United States.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the flow of Mexican students
                        to the United States? Were there characteristics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The first characteristic was in the last decade or so, there was an
                    increase in the flow. Mexico, like much of Latin America, by tradition tended to
                    look more toward Europe for cultural and educational models. Academics lived in
                    a universe that said if you wanted to study engineering or another hard science
                    you might go to the United States, but if you were interested in the arts,
                    literature, history, or political science you ought to go to Europe. That was
                    changing in all of Latin America, but it had notably changed in Mexico. In
                    addition, NAFTA was changing the equation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would NAFTA make a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Because it made clear to people that Mexico's most important
                    relationship was a positive one. Mexicans always knew their relationship with
                    the United States was overpowering, but they tended to see it in negative terms.
                    The Americans would do things to you like start a war, and occupy your capital,
                    and take part of your country away. The Americans were sort of arrogant. They
                    would do what they pleased on the border and didn't much care whaMexicans
                    thought about it. I think the NAFTA context gave Mexico a way to begin to see
                    positive sides and benefits to their relationship with the United States. It
                    became possible to say, “Now wait a minute, this being so close to the United
                    States and so far from God might not be such a bad deal after all. We really
                    ought to benefit from this special relationship we have with the United
                    States.”</p>
                <p>Also, Mexico is very much a part of the intellectual life of Latin America, a
                    leader in that intellectual life, and has also been affected by the decline in
                    the credibility of the dependency theories. In intellectual and political terms,
                    that is probably the most important development in Latin America in the latter
                    half of the 20th Century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you refresh my memory - the dependency theory was
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Dependency theory - I can't give a really competent definition - means
                    whatever bad has happened in my country was caused by the foreigners and
                    probably the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which tends to take away responsibility too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It certainly does, and it was a movement that was tailor made for the
                    Marxists, and tailor made for a lot of the devotees of liberation theology. I
                    don't mean to identify those two with each other, but they shared this stake in
                    dependency theories. It is nice for governments to be able to blame somebody
                    else, but it is also comforting for a society to say “it isn't our fault and if
                    we are disadvantaged economically it is because of our virtue,” and at the heart
                    of liberation theology in human psychology is the notion that you buy economic
                    progress at the expense of spiritual and moral values. You can have one or you
                    can have the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a little bit Jeffersonian too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's right, and it relates to a whole set of societal values that
                    separate northern Europeans and those of the Mediterranean basin, as well as
                    their New World descendants. Take the sense of family, for instance. Latin
                    cultures tend to believe that northern Europeans prospered because they are cold
                    and calculating, don't care very much about their families, and are not very
                    good at human relationships. They buy economic and technical progress by
                    sacrificing human and spiritual values. The leads to the comforting thought that
                    “We may not be rich, but that is because we adhere to higher moral, intellectual
                    and artistic standards. The gringos got rich because we let them exploit us
                    since we are concentrated on higher things.” It is a comforting thought because
                    it lets you off the hook for the lamentable condition of your own country.</p>
                <p>The trouble with the argument is that it isn't true. You don't buy one thing with
                    the other. The same countries that win Nobel prizes in sciences also win them in
                    the arts and literature. A country with bad philosophy more often than not, ends
                    up with bad plumbing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By being in Mexico and seeing their cultural strengths,
                        did you find it was a little hard to keep one's eye on what we were doing,
                        such as explaining the United States as opposed to letting people in the
                        United States know about Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Actually, we had to do both and both were in the USIA mandate. We were
                    very active dealing with groups on both sides of the border that were interested
                    with NAFTA; dealing with groups on both sides that were interested in cultural
                    relations; dealing with people that were interested in everything in the
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>We dealt with great numbers of Americans who had come to Mexico, and with great
                    numbers of Mexicans who were traveling to the United States.</p>
                <p>There certainly was no problem in getting people's interest. Mexicans know a lot
                    about the United States because they watch U.S. television. Sometimes not as
                    much as they think they know, but a lot. They know much more about the United
                    States than Americans know about Mexico.</p>
                <p>Although, if truth be told, there are a lot of Americans in the southwestern
                    United States who do know a lot about Mexico, speak some Spanish, like to be in
                    Mexico, and are interested in the relationship.</p>
                <p>NAFTA was a major part of our job, but in broader terms the main message was
                    democracy in the United States and how it functions and relates to democracy in
                    Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about NAFTA. I'm familiar with the problem in
                        the United States, particularly unions, but what about Mexico? What were we
                        trying to sell, and was there a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Mexico had a lot of the same problems, but the general opinion in
                    Mexico was more favorable to NAFTA than in the United States. There were Mexican
                    unions, too, that felt this would be disadvantageous to them. There were Mexican
                    business people who could see a combination of benefit and risk in the whole
                    thing. There were a lot of Mexican industries that had gotten used to a high
                    level of protection from the Mexican government and were worried about what
                    would happen to them when they didn't have it any more.</p>
                <p>The great majority of Mexicans, however, did believe that it meant they could buy
                    U.S. goods at lower prices. That was very important in Mexico, because a lot of
                    things that make life easier for Mexicans are imported from the United States.
                    If you go to Mexico you see a good many American cars on the road - many of them
                    are manufactured in Mexico, but nevertheless American cars.</p>
                <p>I think the balance of opinion was more favorable to NAFTA in Mexico than it was
                    in the United States. Favoring NAFTA was part of the official policy of the PRI
                    (Partido Revolucionario Institucional), the eternally ruling political party of
                    Mexico. I think we had a slight balance on the Mexican side and a very “iffy”
                    proposition on the U.S. side. Many of the things that would absolutely haunt us
                    on a day to day basis were the terrible things politicians in the United States
                    would say about Mexico as part of the debate. It was fair game to say that
                    Mexico was a country ruled by a pack of environmentally insensitive, human
                    rights violating, labor union bashing morons and the Mexican press rarely missed
                    the story. That's not a nice message to deal with when you had my job.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>What you do when the message is absolutely terrible, when there is no way you can
                    make it look good, is you talk process. That worked in a sense because the
                    process itself is seen as sort of admirable by a lot of Mexicans. We were really
                    saying, “This is the way debate happens in the United States. People are going
                    to say these things and you know they don't mean them. This is something we have
                    to live through. INAFTA is to prosper, it will prosper because there is
                    consensus in the three countries in favor of it. Even iNAFTA could somehow be
                    shoved down the throats of the people of the three countries, it wouldn't
                    work.”</p>
                <p>I think that message worked.</p>
                <p>Emptier part of the message, which related back to our cultural affairs programs,
                    was to say that NAFTA was a big concept and it had its corollaries in other
                    areapolitics, culture education and society in general. All the movement
                    associated with NAFTA will bring lots of changes in the three societies
                    themselves. If you had been dealing with a lesser country than Mexico, the last
                    part of that messagchanges in societwould have been scary. Argentina or
                    Guatemala would have found the prospect of change influenced from the north to
                    be frightening. But Mexico did not to the same extent, and I think that was
                    because Mexico has a very strong sense of itself, its own society, and its own
                    strength.</p>
                <p>That sense of self goes back at least to the Mexican revolution. Out of the
                    absolute horror of the Mexican revolutioa horror based on the extreme divisions
                    in the society between those of Hispanic blood and those of Indian blood and
                    culturcame a realization that the contradiction had to be reconciled in some
                    way.</p>
                <p>The country developed something that went beyond mere ideology, a consciousness,
                    that Mexico was not a transplanted European country in the new world but was a
                    new society, a new race. What we call Columbus Day, Latin Americans call “the
                    day of the race,” which is basically a Mexican concept.</p>
                <p>The idea that out of the conquest came an amalgamation of peoples and cultures
                    that produced something entirely new under the sun. Jose Vasconcelos, an early
                    20th century Mexican educator, called it “the cosmic race.” Mexicans have a very
                    strong sense of that, and Indian elements plat a strong role in the way Mexico
                    behaves and organizes itself. It's a great source of strength to Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find Mexicans bragging about their ancestors, like
                        a great grandmother? Or were there so many people with straight Indian blood
                        that this didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, but it works in strange ways in Mexico. You reminded me of a
                    conversation I once had with the conductor of one of the Mexican symphony
                    orchestras, Enrique Diemecke. We were talking about Mexican composers and
                    Mexican music, and during the conversation - you have to remember this person is
                    blue eyed, blonde, comes from Eastern European immigrants to Mexico (probably
                    early 20th century) - and he said to me, “We are all Indians here in Mexico.” I
                    don' t think he meant that all Mexicans can claim Aztec, Toltec or Mayan
                    bloodlines. What he did mean was something more important - that everybody
                    shares in an Indian culture, in a new world culture that is unlike others.</p>
                <p>Now that is really strong stuff when you start to compare it with the rest of
                    Latin America, and especially with the rest of highland Indian region along the
                    spine of Andes. Culturally and geographically, Mexico, in many ways, belongs to
                    that spine of mountains and those societies, but Mexico has learned a lot in
                    comparison say with Peru and Bolivia, where the system is still almost
                    apartheid.</p>
                <p>If you live in a country like Argentina or Uruguay, or even southern Brazil,
                    which are totally dominated by their European consciousness, who consider
                    themselves transplanted Europeans, then you realize the Mexican solution is
                    really strong stuff and it has really worked because Mexicans think differently
                    about themselves. Although they complain about U.S. power and influence, they
                    aren't really scared about us transforming Mexican society in ways they don't
                    want it to be transformed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were dealing with this in this '92 to '95
                        period, what about the influence of immigration and flow back? How did this
                        play from your perspective of USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Sure, there was a lot of flow back. A lot of the illegal or
                    undocumented immigrants do come back all the time and they do bring back
                    influences from the United States. Somehow that doesn't bother Mexicans very
                    much. Whereas Mexico is very protective of its own culture; they believe more
                    than other people believe that they have a culture that is worthy of export,
                    that is worthy of examination that has a lot of good things about it, and they
                    tend to think more in terms of presenting and projecting that culture abroad
                    than they do in terms of protecting it in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk tactics. I assume that to a person our
                        embassy was sold on NAFTA. This was not something that was crafted in
                        Washington and begrudged at the embassy in Mexico. Am I correct in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I'm sure there were people who had their individual doubts, but I
                    didn't think we had much of a problem of people in the embassy in Mexico City
                    being lukewarm on NAFTA.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>There were probably some people on the law enforcement side of the embassy who
                    might have thought NAFTA was a bit too generous, in the sense that maybe we
                    should hold out for more cooperation from the Mexicans on the drug enforcement
                    side than we were getting. That was probably balanced by other people in the
                    same community thinking enforcement might improve under NAFTA.</p>
                <p>Tactics? The tactic that I followed and believed in was to emphasize the benefits
                    that would accrue to Mexico. The economic benefits were pretty clear. Mexicans
                    were already convinced NAFTA was going to lower prices. They were already
                    convinced it would increase job opportunities for Mexico.</p>
                <p>Just like Americans were afraid of the great sucking sound Ross Perot so
                    colorfully described. But some Mexicans also saw that it was better to be the
                    sucker than the suckee. They have already seen jobs flowing south.</p>
                <p>A lot of our tactic was to convince people that there would be collaterals all
                    over the place, especially in the area of education. The whole time I was in
                    Mexico we worked on various schemes to create a sort of educational NAFTA. There
                    ought to be a free flow of educational and intellectual resources among the
                    three countries. It ought to be very easy for a Canadian to study in Mexico or
                    an American to study in Canada, or whatever. The three ought to go together.
                    There wasn't a great deal of funding for this activity, but a lot of what I did
                    had to do with big, often overblown meetings of educational authorities from the
                    three countries who would get together and try to come up with schemes, try to
                    talk each other into offering scholarships. The meetings were extremely
                    interesting, produced a whole lot of talk and a lot of meaningful low level
                    activity, individually and university to university. but they were not able to
                    create any big chunks of funding for particular trilateral initiatives. I
                    suppose the contact work and jawboning really did have some effect, and I think
                    it was worth doing. There is more cooperation among universities in the three
                    countries now than there was before we started all that.</p>
                <p>My days had to do with that sort of education stuff, and a lot of them had to do
                    with being the person that supervised the people that wrote the speeches for the
                    ambassador. Both ambassadors had heavy speaking schedules.</p>
                <p>Also, I had to deal with individual press flaps and a lot of time dealing with
                    delegations from the United States that wanted to talk to embassy people.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>The performing arts side of cultural affairs was also very important. It was
                    almost an irony: whereas the United State, then and now, was willing to spend
                    almost nothing on American performing arts being presented in other countries,
                    the Mexicans were extremely interested in it and felt that high culture should
                    have the patronage of the government. A lot of American performers did come to
                    Mexico. I found that using my representational funds (which were pretty good)
                    and my residence, which was nice, that I could sort of piggyback and get listed
                    as a cosponsor of a whole lot of important American cultural events by simply
                    giving a reception. I'm not a big fan of big receptions, but the one place I
                    sort of changed my view on that was in Mexico City. Every time any American of
                    any importance in the cultural world would come to Mexico, I would be asked to
                    give a reception at some point and be listed as a cosponsor. I was glad to do it
                    and the price was right, considering the money I had.</p>
                <p>We also funded some programing that had to do with how the arts are supported in
                    the United States, because Mexico was in a privatizing mood and the Salinas
                    government had gone around to the official arts organizations in Mexico and
                    said, “Hey, the old days aren't coming back, we are going to keep reducing your
                    funding and what you need to do is find out how to raise funds to support your
                    organizations out of the private sector. So symphony orchestra number two, get
                    out and do some fundraising. Art museum number three, get out and get to the
                    private sector and find out how to do this because the government funds are
                    going to dry up eventually.”</p>
                <p>Q: This is very difficult because unless you have a population that is brought up
                    in a philanthropic mode, as the United States is, how would this work?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Part of it was easier because Mexicans live close to the United States
                    and have experience with this. They don't do our kind of fund raising but they
                    have seen it. Part of it had to do with the decline of dependency theories, the
                    concomitant rise of the notion that we have to take responsibility for
                    ourselves. Part of it was a consciousness that it might not be right that all
                    the taxpayers in Mexico should have to support an opera production when very few
                    people in the country really like opera. We found a lot of people coming to us
                    and saying they were interested in how we finance arts in the United States and
                    they wanted advice on how it was done. They thought that was what they wanted to
                    do, because government funds were going to dry up and also because it would
                    increase their independence.</p>
                <p>When people came to us we used different kinds of resources. Sometimes it would
                    be educational exchange resources to get people up there to look at how it was
                    done in the United States. We brought the chief fundraiser for the Cleveland
                    symphony down to Mexico City to hold seminars and talk with the administrators
                    of various symphony orchestras. We worked out arrangements with the Ohio Arts
                    Council where they came and visited Mexico and talked about how they worked with
                    the state arts council in the United States. They invited representatives to
                    come to Ohio and spend a couple of weeks with them to see how they did it.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>There was another positive aspect. We finally began to get another message
                    through to Mexico, which was hard. Mexico had always wanted to deal on a sort of
                    official government to government level in cultural affairs. They wanted to have
                    cultural talks every year; they want to have an omnibus cultural agreement.
                    People in various ministries who were in charge of cultural affairs wanted to
                    deal with their counterparts in Washington. We kept saying there no real
                    counterparts up there. We don't have a culture ministry. We have a department of
                    education but it doesn't really run the schools. It has some influence on public
                    schools, but almost none on universities that we have been able to detect. We
                    began to try to get the message through to them that often their counterparts
                    are at the state level in the United States. If you want to talk about how a
                    public education system runs you have to talk to the states in the United
                    States. If you want to talk about cultural programs, a state art council is
                    going to know much more about how you distribute grants to various people so
                    they can put on a show. If you want to talk to a museum, there is no department
                    of museums that you can talk to, you have to go to Denver or to San
                    Francisco.</p>
                <p>Although there was a certain attitude among Mexican officials that said “I don't
                    want to deal with state or local officials because I am a national level
                    official and I should have a counterpart,” I think we did make progress in
                    getting the message through. By making things happen and making sure people were
                    treated well, we licked part of that protocol problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that by breaking their rice bowl, by breaking
                        this down they felt challenged? A bureaucrat at the central level felt
                        challenged by going down to the state level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think a little bit, but their rice bowl had already been broken. If
                    anybody was breaking their rice bowl, it was their own government, it wasn't
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a growing regional way, as in the United
                        States, we have our states and they have their states, did they play much of
                        a role at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Less so, but it depends on the state. I mean the states that have big
                    cities in them could begin to relate to big cities in the United States. In
                    cultural affairs it is almost more city to city relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sister cities - was that big ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, yes, there was a lot of that sister cities stuff going on in
                    Mexico, but I can't remember who was with whom. It worked at all sorts of
                    levels. There is a lot of private, non governmental cultural exchange between
                    Mexico and the United States. In many ways we at the embassy were merely
                    responding to a Mexican notion that there ought to be governmental involvement
                    in culture rather than paying for a whole lot of exchange ourselves.</p>
                <p>For example, there were a lot of Americans playing in Mexican symphony
                    orchestras. They got hired because Mexicans know how to get into the trade
                    publications in the United States and hire musicians. They were rapidly
                    disappearing by the time I left Mexico, because the Russians had come on the
                    market and they were able to work for much lower salaries than the Americans
                    were. You can go to relatively small cities in Mexico and find a symphony
                    orchestra with a lot of Americans in it, playing the season for a couple of
                    thousand bucks. I wish Mexico luck in transitioning to more private support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a different society. I watch in the United States and
                        this is in our bones, that you are supposed to do things on a local level
                        and tithe yourself. Even in Europe this is kind of alien.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It is, although that was a lot of the message we were working and the
                    Mexicans to some extent were absorbing. Individual responsibility and giving are
                    the hardest part, but that is only part of the game. A lot of it is corporate
                    charities, it's foundation charities, it's grant writing, it's proposals.</p>
                <p>The idea that corporations might support culture is not alien to Mexico or in the
                    rest of Latin America. Banks have art museums; big individual industrialists
                    often think they should own a newspaper and that newspaper ought to have a
                    cultural page. There are a lot of things that push the very wealthy into hobbies
                    that frankly eventually can redound to the cultural benefit of the country.</p>
                <p>What was most important about that period was that the Mexican cultural officials
                    were getting accustomed to the idea of private support and beginning to like it.
                    I think they began to see that they could vary the portfolio. They could have
                    donations coming in from enough different places so that nobody would have a
                    preponderant influence over them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a constant battle with Canada? I guess it's
                        not quite the same because Canada is one language, but a spillover of our
                        culture, special magazines, I mean the Canadians really fight the
                        Americanization of their media outlets. Was this an issue with you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think it was an unspoken issue in our tripartite education
                    deliberations. I think the Canadians had the notion there was a common cause to
                    be made with Mexico that national governments ought to protect the national
                    culture. This was especially pronounced on the French side of the equation in
                    Canada, but not unknown on the Anglo side of Canada either. The Mexicans weren't
                    really very interested. As I have said, at least on an official level, Mexico is
                    much more interested in projecting its culture than protecting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't having to deal with protests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, we would have protests, but the biggest one I remember was
                    generalized international issues; the remnants of the Mexican left. Then the
                    California initiative to severely limit immigration and to keep kids out of
                    public schools - that produced some big demonstrations because it was insulting
                    to Mexicans.</p>
                <p>The Mexican attitude toward immigration is very complicated. They don't
                    particularly like the fact that their economy doesn't produce enough jobs to
                    gainfully occupy the people it needs to. On the other hand, they really do
                    believe that Mexicans have a perfect right to go and work where there is a job.
                    They do believe that the Americans are hypocritical, in a sense, because we try
                    to keep them out on one hand but then we provide the jobs on the other. It's not
                    hard to imagine what might give them that idea.</p>
                <p>Deep in the Mexican psyche is the idea that if a Mexican goes to work in Texas,
                    New Mexico, or California why the hell shouldn't he? “We were there long before
                    the Gringos were and it was only our mistake that we invited the Gringos in and
                    we shouldn't have done it.” The Mexican official attitude is an interesting one,
                    too, because they are very much into consular protection of their people. And
                    they are often pretty good at it, although the task is daunting. And their
                    potential constituents often do not come to them. They may not trust the Mexican
                    government much more than they trust the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once, when I was with a senior seminar, I interviewed
                        various consuls in the United States and the Mexicans said they often had a
                        problem because their citizens would be arrested but they would not want
                        their government to know about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Exactly. There is a lot of that. Our local police are no more aware of
                    the rules on consular access than are the police in most other countries; they
                    may even be somewhat less informed. And often when they are aware of the
                    obligation to inform a foreign consulate, they think it's a bad idea and don't
                    do it. This means Mexican consulates, and others, have to proceed on an almost
                    political basis - monitor the media and try to identify the problems and go
                    after access.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>There are some real irritants in our consular relations with Mexico, capitol
                    punishment being one. Mexico does not have it and we do. There are a number of
                    Mexicans sitting on death row in the United States, and it creates a problem
                    every time it happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: There isn't much you can do about it except remind them it is the law
                    in the United States and that ample appeals were available. It is difficult to
                    make the death penalty look good to a country that doesn't have it.</p>
                <p>Those are the irritants of countries that share a long border. The other issues
                    that are very irritating to Mexicans were the measures we would take across the
                    border to prevent illegal immigration and the drug traffic also. The Mexican
                    government was very clear. They understood our right, obligation, and duty to
                    protect our border. They understood people came across that weren't documented;
                    they thought our standards of documentation were way too high and that we should
                    have more open access to Mexican workers.</p>
                <p>However, they react very negatively to symbolism, to measures that seem to have
                    symbolic value, that appear to them to reflect a generalized notion that the
                    United States has to protect itself from Mexico. They especially object to walls
                    and fences being put up.</p>
                <p>They also object to bad treatment of Mexicans by American immigration officials -
                    and there is a lot of that going on. There is also a lot of bad treatment by
                    Mexican officials of Americans trying to come over, too. Those are difficult
                    problems to deal with because you have to have sympathy for the border patrol
                    people. They have been given an absolutely impossible task.</p>
                <p>I think if there were ever an example of a woefully disgraceful, irresponsible,
                    unfunded mandate, it has to do with U.S. immigration policy. The principle
                    shortchanged institutions are the U.S. border patrol and the U.S. Department of
                    State. The border patrol is no more capable of controlling the traffic over the
                    Mexican border than the U.S. consular service is of giving visas in a rational,
                    thoughtful, humane way. It simply cannot be done. Our consular sections are
                    overwhelmed and the border patrol is overwhelmed. There is a terrible negative
                    effect on the morale of people being asked to do a job they can't do well, and
                    to do it day in and day out. Our consular officers know they can't interview 60
                    people a day and do a good job of it. The difference is however that our
                    consular people don't have to work that visa line forever. They go to other
                    assignments. But a lot of the border patrol people are there for the duration.
                    Sometimes they get cynical; sometimes they get lazy; sometimes they get
                    mean.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>The irritants are never going to go away in that situation, and the Mexican
                    consciousness that the border shouldn't be there anyway is never going to go
                    away. I hadn't thought too much about the Mexican war before I went to Mexico,
                    but it looms large in Mexican history. In American history, it is a dumb little
                    rehearsal for the Civil War, but for Mexicans it is a major, major event.</p>
                <p>In some ways, the impact of it came home to me once fairly early in my tour, when
                    I was leafing through a big coffee table book on Mexico and there was a painting
                    of the central square in Mexico City and the cathedral with an American flag
                    flying above it. That is a shocking image to somebody living in Mexico. After
                    all, I lived in the shadow of Chapultepec Castle and Chapultepec Castle was
                    where young cadets fought to the death against American troops. What really hurt
                    Mexico was the loss of territory. Any human being in the world understands what
                    the loss of national territory is.</p>
                <p>You can rationalize it all you want but the fact is, neither Mexico nor Spain had
                    any success at all in convincing Spanish speaking people of their own nation to
                    go and live in those places. Almost by the same token, no Latin American country
                    has ever been really successful in getting people to go live in the interior of
                    the country. It's tough in there, and you don't have the same culturally based
                    pioneerism in Latin culture that you have in Anglo Saxon, and especially in
                    Scotch Irish, culture in the United States. The fact is, the United States went
                    to war and bit off a huge chunk of Mexican territory; Mexico was humiliated by
                    its inability to defend itself. The Mexican war is probably characterized in
                    world terms by a not very good army beating the tar out of a really terrible
                    army.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Santa Anna come out of this? He was a pretty
                        despicable general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well he was a better politician than he was a general. Not many
                    Mexicans see Santa Anna as a particularly positive character. The only good
                    thing they see about him is he stood up to the Americans for awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the media there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Well, the media was really interesting in Mexico. You have a number of
                    big powerful, traditional, family owned newspapers which are quite good. They
                    are conservative and pursue their own economic interests. There are also papers
                    affiliated with political parties that pursue partisan interests. Nevertheless,
                    many of the papers are better than what I have said sounds. No matter what
                    interests you pursue, you still have to sell papers. If the perception of your
                    paper is that it is too much in the hands of the party or the owners, folks
                    probably won't buy it and it will cost you even more to run it than it does
                    already. A lot of papers don't make much money anyway, but they are owned by
                    people who have other interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>Televisa is an entertainment conglomerate owned by the Azcarraga family. It is a
                    major, major media organization. It may, as a network, compare almost in size
                    with U.S. networks, in the sense of the number of outlets it has, and especially
                    in the sense of how its programing is sold in other countries.</p>
                <p>Televisa is very interested in the United States. As Azcarraga once told me, the
                    United States is the third largest Spanish speaking country in the world. This
                    is a big deal for them because they know they can sell a lot of programs in the
                    United States. The Spanish speaking market is here, and the United States can
                    afford it. They also have a major interest themselves in Univision, the U.S.
                    Spanish language network, so they are really a big deal. They are fascinating to
                    watch.</p>
                <p>Their news broadcasting is okay and it's technically very competent. They have
                    correspondents, satellite access, and they can put on a perfectly respectable
                    news broadcast by anybody's standards. Their journalists, in my opinion, are not
                    as good, nor as free of corporate influence as they ought to be, and not as free
                    as television journalists are in the United States.</p>
                <p>Their entertainment production is fascinating because they run on the Hollywood
                    studio system of the 1930s. This is a system that Azcarraga knows very well,
                    which he remembers and admired. Their superstars are people they identified as
                    kids, kept in the studio, and who they made into household names around Latin
                    America, and around the world. Televisa sees these major personalities as
                    members of their stable, and if they don't do as they are told, by God, they
                    will be fired in a country minute.</p>
                <p>Televisa produces a huge number of soap operas. They also produce mini series
                    type historical spectacles and variety show style entertainment. To see what
                    Televisa produces, just turn on Channel 30 in Washington, DC. It is all there.
                    The worldwide reach of Televisa productions was brought home to me during a
                    visit Ambassador Negroponte and I made to the studios. As we entered the waiting
                    area a European gentleman rose from his chair and greeted the Ambassador as a
                    long lost friend. It turned out he was the ex Soviet ambassador in Mexico City
                    who had gone to work for Televisa marketing their productions in Russia.</p>
                <p>Televisa is a big money earner, a very profitable operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any particular outlet of the media to be a
                        place where the left settled and hit home with the United States whenever
                        possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, some of the tabloids do, but they tend to be more “right
                    nationalist” than they are “left” papers. Again, it's not quite as fashionable
                    to keep hitting the United States as it used to be. That is an important
                    development because many of the people who were in the classic left probably
                    don't even consider themselves left anymore. What they tend to do now is
                    criticize their own society. They think bad things happen to them because they
                    are doing the wrong things. Sometimes I was really surprised by some of the
                    things that were said.</p>
                <p>The line sort of goes like this: “Our own heritage made us dependent. It is the
                    legacy of Spanish misrule. Or it is the fact in our society we only like
                    priests, soldiers, and bureaucrats. It is our inability to develop our own
                    private sectors. The only people who know how to be entrepreneurs in our society
                    are the Indians who we have kept down and never allowed to get much money, and
                    the foreigners who come in and run our businesses for us.”</p>
                <p>Like the dependency theories that preceded it, this “the problem is our society”
                    theory is based on kernels of truth. I remember Richard Henry Dana's, Two Years
                    before the Mast. He describes a port of call in Mexican California where the
                    ship trades New England industrial goodshoes for examplfor the hides of
                    California cattle. They load the ship by throwing the hides off a cliff to the
                    beach below. Very picturesque. Dana and his shipmates visit the town of Santa
                    Barbara for a parta fandango Dana calls it. His description of the town, how it
                    was organized and how it worked, sounds a lot like what I saw in 1970 in Santa
                    Cruz in the interior of Bolivia. Here was this society of nice people, very
                    stratified with a few folks on top. Almost nothing resembling modern, or even
                    not so modern, industrial goods were being made locally. Hides from California
                    were being shipped to New England to be turned into shoes which were shipped
                    back to California. And the only store in town was being run by an American.</p>
                <p>At any rate, some of pressures to automatically blame the United States for the
                    economic woes of the country has sort of petered out. That doesn't mean some
                    folks won't continue to blame the United States for immigration problems, or
                    mistreatment Mexicans in the United States, or a lack of respect for Mexico.
                    Many cultural factors still play, but are not as important as they used to
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were dealing with left wing intellectuals
                        at the university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, well, look, because of the kind of stuff we were working on - the
                    NAFTA, tripartite, education stuff - I was dealing at a pretty senior level at
                    the universities and had very cordial relations with some of the rectors and
                    others. The feeling I had with most of the rectors was, that I was dealing with
                    fairly conservative people who would have liked to be more conservative if their
                    university would have let them. Smart people do respond to their
                    constituencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>Not too long ago they broke up a strike at the Autonomous University in Mexico
                    City. That goes back to a dispute I talked to the Rector about when I first
                    visited him at the beginning of my tour in Mexico. He just wanted to charge a
                    little bit - I don't know what the price was, maybe 76 cents a semester - to go
                    to the University. He could see funding beginning to dry up. And I guess maybe
                    he thought ti wasn't fair that all taxpayers pay to educate a kid whose old man
                    has lots of money. Some kid who drives a BMW to class everyday shouldn't be
                    funded by tax payers. I found that a lot of the university administrators hoped
                    to move toward something more like some private funding for university
                    education, but were being absolutely stymied. The student organizations just
                    weren't going to permit it.</p>
                <p>Student activists did shut the Autonomous University down, and there was very
                    little authorities could do about it because of the memories of the clashes in
                    1968 before the Olympics. The military intervened in student demonstrations and
                    a lot of people got killed. It was a seminal event in Mexican history. It really
                    horrified Mexico. When Mexico gets horrified, they do something about it. They
                    say, “This will not happen again. We are going to work our way around this.”
                    Sometimes that attitude can have some paralyzing effects on things. It is still
                    difficult to deal with university resistance. On the other hand, the Mexican
                    government still funds the Autonomous University very generously. That is a big
                    deal. They do a lot of serious research, and they try to do a serious job of
                    educating the undergraduate. All in all, an admirable institution. I think I
                    have to stop here.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 17th of March 2000, the first St. Patrick's
                        Day in the new millennium. Jeff, let's take some events. Did you see changes
                        in the political structure, or was this becoming apparent and were we
                        watching or doing anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely, but being it's St. Patrick's Day, that means it's time to
                    remember the San Patricios. The San Patricios were Irish soldiers (mostly
                    deserters from the U.S. Army), who fought on the Mexican side during the Mexican
                    war. After the successful storming of the Chapultepec Castle, a whole lot of
                    them were captured and hanged by the U.S. Army within sight of the castle. A
                    very sad event.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>Institutional change in Mexico, and an opening of the political system was very
                    much the order of the day during the time I was in Mexico. The best of those
                    aligned with President Salinas were very aware that the PRI hadn't changed. We
                    started to develop some new terms in the way people talked about the PRI
                    (Spanish acronym for the Institutional Revolutionary Party.) The term “the
                    dinosaurs,” came into vogue. The dinosaurs were those members of the PRI who saw
                    no need to change and thought things could run on the same well greased skids of
                    patronage that had always moved the party.</p>
                <p>But Salinas and his people were certainly committed to at least some level of
                    change, to an opening in the political process, and to democratization of the
                    political process. This was accompanied by a sense that you also had to open the
                    economic system. The old system of well supervised state capitalism wasn't going
                    to work well in Mexico any more. The economy had to open up, and the state had
                    to divest itself of the overwhelming influence it had had on the economy in
                    Mexico all during the sixty years of PRI rule. Nevertheless, while It is
                    relatively easy for the leadership to decide that things have to change, but it
                    is very difficult to get that change down to the working political level, and
                    especially outside the capital city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this is where the political leaders can
                        maneuver, but when you get farther down in the party they don't have wiggle
                        room.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: That's right, and I think the equation that constantly occurs is
                    somebody on the provincial level says, “Well now, what is it you want? Do you
                    want to open up the system or do you want to win the election? Which is it,
                    because they don't really go together ? If we open the system and begin to
                    abandon the chain of patronage that kept this party in power all these years,
                    then we may not win the election. It is no good you telling me you want it open,
                    fair, and democratic, and you still want to win, because that's not the way it
                    is going to work.”</p>
                <p>A lot of times those people may well be right. Those politicians who had a
                    provincial rather than a national base, were the most resistant to change. You
                    had two poles of opposition to the PRI, one in PAN (the National Action Party)
                    and the in the PRD the Party of the Democratic Revolution.) The PAN was centered
                    mainly in the north around the city of Monterey, rather conservative but
                    dominated by modern pro business types, who were very heartened by NAFTA, and
                    felt they could see a future for Mexico as a major player in the world economy.
                    In opposition to that you had a large number of people to the left of the PRI
                    around Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who had already lost one presidential election, but
                    who believed in a more classic third world stance for Mexico, and that the
                    government had to intervene in the economy to assure fairness to the great
                    majority of Mexicans who, after all, are poor.</p>

                <p>It would be easy to be cynical about efforts to reform the PRI. My judgment is,
                    those efforts were genuine and sincere, even though we now know about Salinas
                    and the troubles he came into - the inordinate involvement of his family in the
                    economy, the bad behavior of some members of his family (particularly his
                    brother), the fact that he was into all kinds of dirty money, and that there
                    were heavy irregularities in campaign financing. Nevertheless, Salinas'
                    perception that change was necessary if the party was to survive was absolutely
                    genuine. He really believed in it and he really worked at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any call on you to say, “Here, I can get State
                        leaders of the Democrat and Republican parties to talk with you, and that
                        type of thing to get a better feel for how it works?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The answer is yes, although not a lot of calls on us in USIS or the
                    embassy because the contacts were already there.</p>
                <p>Every year the border state governors get together and have a meeting. One year
                    in Mexico and the next year in the United States. The border governors
                    conferences are big deals. Governors show up and their staffs show up. These are
                    people that know each other, and work issues across the border all the time.</p>
                <p>You also have the annual bilateral consultations between the two national
                    governments, held alternately in Mexico and the United States - either in
                    Washington or Mexico City - which come down to a fairly well attended joint
                    cabinet meeting. Secretaries and ministers from both sides tend to show up, and
                    you have a very complicated agenda with plenary, and breakout sessions dealing
                    with the whole range of governmental issues. It is easy to say this is a lot of
                    hot air and talk, and a lot of times we don't communicate very well because the
                    two governments do things in very different ways. However, it tends to open up
                    the political section of both countries to scrutiny by the other.</p>
                <p>Our Americans sort of do understand how the PRI operates, because it operates
                    like American political parties really did operate before the era of massive
                    primaries. It is not an exotic system that we can't fathom, nor are we that
                    exotic to the Mexicans. That is what is so unique about the U.S. Mexico
                    relationship. We understand each other rather well. That, of course, begins to
                    fall down the farther you get from the border, and I guess it would be true that
                    people from Ohio find people from Chiapas or Oaxaca pretty exotic and difficult
                    to fathom. By the same token, folks in Mexico City also find people in Chiapas
                    pretty hard to fathom.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, we don't deal with Mexico in terms of a great deal of
                    misunderstanding. I suppose that is an important thought because in our
                    rhetoric, certainly Mexicans and Anglo Americans, tend to deal with disagreement
                    by pretending that it is misunderstanding. We often say, “No, you didn't really
                    understand what I was trying to tell you.” Of course the other person
                    understood, he just doesn't agree with you. Mexicans tend to understand better
                    than we do that we simply disagree and, at times, have different interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a movement toward a multi or dual party system in
                        Mexico, did you find you were doing any adjustment to your operations to
                        facilitate or respond, or was this just not in our purview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We understood very well that we had to deal with people from the PRI
                    and the PAN, as well as with people from the Cardenas' PRD. That was not strange
                    to us and American embassies figured out quite awhile ago that you have to be
                    able to show that you deal with the opposition or you are going to get beaten
                    up. Probably not by the Department of State but by everybody else. Again, we are
                    not dealing with Paraguay. We are dealing with a Mexican government that
                    understands the reasons for our contact with the opposition. Their own foreign
                    ministry understands perfectly well that it has to deal with the opposition in
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>It's a very intimate relationship between the two countries, and not very
                    restrained by diplomatic niceties. I think the U.S. Department of State and the
                    Mexican Foreign Ministry are both inhabited by very old fashioned folks, who
                    really believe that relationships between the two countries ought to be run out
                    of the respected ministries, but they know deep in their hearts that is not true
                    and will not happen. Think back to the phenomenon of the bilateral
                    consultations. This is not the Mexican foreign ministry and the State Department
                    talking to each other. It is almost all ministries of the Mexican government
                    talking to their departmental counterparts in the U.S. government, and working
                    out their own bilateral relationships. The foreign ministries in both cases
                    handle the formalities - they do the hosting. They dot the Is and cross the Ts,
                    but they both know they better not get in the way of the working relationships
                    or they are going to have problems.</p>
                <p>Q: We had a new president in January '93, William Clinton, traditionally, the
                    first or second State visit is either to Canada or Mexico. You were there in
                    '1995 so you must have had a Clinton visit sometime.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, we did. Wow, you know visits wind up being a big blur in memory
                    because the preparations are so intense. What can I tell you? I hadn't worked
                    even a cabinet level visit in a sizable country since Brazil in the mid '70s.
                    There had been big changes - a lot of them technology driven - and some of them
                    ruled by the fact that visiting parties kept getting bigger and bigger.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>The big technological changes were the speed with which print, thought, and text
                    could be transmitted. It was instantaneous, so there could be a lot more
                    consultation on what various people were going to say, and what the essence of
                    the visit's central message was to be. The fact that there was a great deal more
                    consultation didn't necessarily mean that what the embassy wanted to say
                    necessarily made all the cuts.</p>
                <p>In terms of coordinating events, the impact of the cell phone was really
                    important. Working visits in Brazil in the '70s, we were beginning to us“walkie
                    talkies,” and we had those with everybody on one network, where everybody heard
                    what everybody else was saying. People tended to lose them and leave them
                    someplace. That had all changed when we were working in Mexico 20 years later.
                    We had some cell phones and the first thing we did was go out and lease, beg,
                    borrow, steal, or rent a whole lot more. Anybody that was out of the building
                    had a cell phone and could talk discreetly. That was a big difference, a big
                    help, and saved us a whole lot on things like transportation.</p>
                <p>The Clinton people arrived early. The main impact on USIS of a big visit that the
                    press section is thoroughly engaged and probably needs more people, so you rob
                    out of the cultural side to get people to the press section. You also use your
                    cultural section people to take up escort duties at various times. But you have
                    to keep your press people focused on issues of the press itself.</p>
                <p>There was a huge events in the big national auditorium. A major speech with a lot
                    of complicated calculations on who would be in an audience of thousands, with
                    the right mix of old people, young people, opposition, labor unions and business
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving from that to Cuba, did Cuba play much of a
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, Cuba as a nation played almost no role in any practical issue. But
                    Cuba as symbol is a touch stone of Mexican policy. It is almost the way that
                    Mexico distinguishes its foreign policy from that of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Canada has been using it too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Absolutely. I remember once saying, in a fit of cynicism, that
                    diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union was what Latin American countries did
                    instead of land reform. It makes you look moderately progressive, but has few
                    tangible domestic consequences.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>Cuba, to the Mexicans, is a way of saying, “Our foreign policy is different from
                    the United States, it's a way of showing solidarity with the rest of Latin
                    America and the third world.” That having been said, they don't trust Cuba and
                    they certainly don't trust Castro. They don't want him to have any influence in
                    Mexican politics.</p>
                <p>Mexico also has a tradition of offering asylum to political dissidents of which
                    it is justifiably proud and which was greatly strengthened during the Spanish
                    Civil War. That is a tradition with which we should have some sympathy, because
                    we share it. Exiles from Spain during the Spanish Civil War still have a lot of
                    influence in Mexico, and are accorded a lot of honor and respect. That sort of
                    extends to Cuba and what it comes down to is that Mexico will maintain its
                    relationship with Cuba and present it to the world as a sympathetic
                    relationship. It will champion some of Castro's causes as does much of Latin
                    America and Canada.</p>
                <p>That policy is quite acceptable to the Mexican public which finds U.S. policy
                    toward Mexico to be unduly harsh, and unduly influenced by Cuban exiles in the
                    United States. Gee, go figure, what would give them an idea like that? On the
                    other hand, the Mexican government does not want Cuba messing around in Mexico,
                    and Castro understands that very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing anything to promote American history and
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think the bloom had sort of gone off that rose. That was a major
                    part of USIA activity ten years earlier. The idea was that you went around and
                    established chairs of American Studies or tried to get some university to build
                    a building and call it, “The Center for American Studies.” That seems
                    superfluous in Mexico, although it really is not.</p>
                <p>There is a European academic orientation in Mexico that has to do with the fact
                    that its universities, led by the Autonomous University of Mexico City, tend to
                    follow European models. Mexican Universities are a collection of faculties
                    around a major urban center, rather loosely controlled by a central
                    administration that doesn't have very much clout. They tend to have campuses in
                    the sense that there is a center where the buildings are - often some very nice
                    buildings - but in many of them there is not much in the way of dormitories and
                    places for students to live.</p>
                <p>There are also some American modeled experiments that have been pretty successful
                    and are heavily endowed by counterparts and patrons in the United States. The
                    Universidad de las Americas in Puebla is a prime example. It has a lot of
                    American students and a lot of U.S. citizens serve on the board, who have a
                    great interest in how the school is run. It is a very attractive college with
                    dormitories and a campus that looks and acts like an American campus.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>The Technological University in Monterey tends to see itself as the Mexican MIT
                    (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and keeps its contacts with MIT,
                    Caltech (California Institute of Technology), and other major institutions. It
                    is stunning in its modern architecture, its technical facility, its use of
                    computers, and has satellite links all over the country. They do very impressive
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a change in business, political, and other
                        cultural climates as the computer was coming on the scene while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, absolutely. In the first place, you can do technological leaps.
                    We've seen that in other countries, and we see it in the media. If you have
                    never managed to develop a very good telephone system, which is the case in much
                    of the world, you may jump over that by having cell phone systems that really do
                    work. The cell phone system in Mexico is very impressive. If it takes you eight
                    months to get a telephone, and then it doesn't work and costs too much, you are
                    going to be very tempted toward cell phones. If you have never developed
                    broadcast television very well, or you have a crappy government run network,
                    video cassette recorders and tape rentals - as well as pirating - are going to
                    do really well in your country. Big dish satellite systems for those who are in
                    the footprints of the U.S. domestic satellites, or even international
                    satellites, are going to proliferate. How did I get on that subject?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was asking about technological change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Technological change, often is more impressive as an engine of change
                    in the less developed countries than it is in big countries. It is very hard to
                    overestimate the power of technological change in Mexico. When the rebellion
                    broke out in Chiapas, all of a sudden the guerillas had no problem with
                    communication. They grabbed their cell phones and would be talking to their
                    friends and funders in the United States, or wherever in no time. If they didn't
                    have a cell phone at hand, they could use the solar powered installations that
                    the Mexican government had put in all through the rural areas of Mexico in order
                    to get telephone service to people. Internet? Absolutely! The transmission of
                    information is no longer a problem, but that doesn't mean reaching agreement has
                    stopped being a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about USIA and its response to
                        technological changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Not great, but pretty good, and stunningly effective when compared to
                    the State Department. USIA and State started about even on computerization and
                    dealt with it in different ways. I think the only reason USIA eventually did it
                    better, had to do with not having a strong, centralized administrative structure
                    in place. To explain that, you start with the premise that the Washington
                    administration of both organizations fell into the trap of saying, “No, we're
                    going to wait to buy this new computer equipment because something new is coming
                    up.” They had a bureaucratic instinct that said they had better get one system -
                    that meant Wang. They didn't anticipate that eventually the IBM computer would
                    become adaptable to all systems, and that they wouldn't have to buy all their
                    computers from the same company.</p>
                <p>State stuck with Wang way too long. They stuck with Wang after Wang went belly
                    up. USIA didn't. Mainly, because there was a successful revolt on the part of
                    senior PAOs overseas, who said they couldn't get along anymore without
                    computers, and would buy them from funds in their post budgets. That is
                    essentially what happened. USIA central administration didn't know how to stop
                    it, and didn't have the budget structure to make it stop. Maybe that's the big
                    object lesson, that PAOs in the field tend to control their own funds which
                    enable them to decide to not hire another person and buy computers instead.
                    Unfortunately, State did not have that flexibility, nor did it have enough
                    senior people involved in communications overseas to see the need. Too much of
                    State's use of computers was seen in terms of typing and not communication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I think they got caught up in the correlation side,
                        rather than transmitting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: But you can start with a more profound problem. The State Department
                    was the only organization I had ever seen where the senior officials still
                    dictated to secretaries taking shorthand. Nobody in USIA did that. I guess
                    because, initially in the fifties we recruited people out of academia and out of
                    the press, and they all had learned to use the keyboard. Every now and then we
                    would get old PAOs who would complain because they couldn't get a manual
                    typewriter anymore instead of an electric, but at least they could type.</p>
                <p>IState didn't see the need for computerization in political sections they
                    certainly should have, because if there was anything that could make the
                    clearance process faster and smarter, it was the word processor. Suddenly you
                    could make a change because it was a good idea to make the change and you didn't
                    have to say, “But I don't have time to make the change. Who the hell is going to
                    retype the whole page?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could type your own letters and you didn't have to
                        wait for someone to be ready. Things moved faster.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>DIETERICH: Yes, but I think what may have gone wrong - an overreaction - was the
                    assumption that everybody ought to start typing their own letters. It still may
                    not be a good use of time. In embassies now, too many high paid officers are
                    spending time doing routine things on word processors that could be done by
                    somebody less expensive, and we lost all the other things that our secretaries
                    did, like organizing and coordinating the functions of the office, not to
                    mention screening phone calls phone calls, and all those other things that make
                    for efficiency.</p>
                <p>You know, if the senior officer is trying to decide what copies he really needs
                    while he makes the copies, that is a different equation and may even make sense.
                    But if he is just standing there watching a copy machine, it doesn't make
                    sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: A whole lot of time is still wasted. Another thing that happened in
                    State that actually slowed down technological change, I think, was that we
                    always had the comm center and they were people who we counted on to manage the
                    change for us. What we didn't foresee was that they were going to begin managing
                    the change against us. They became the arbiters of what technology we ought to
                    be using, and they became the only people who understood it. That allowed them
                    to shift work to other people and make life easier for themselves. I'm being a
                    little unfair because communications is a tough job.</p>
                <p>But let me give you an example. In Tel Aviv in the press section, we had to turn
                    out a summary of the Hebrew press in English by about ten in the morning both
                    for Washington and our own use. That was a press summary that was read all over
                    the place, including the Pentagon and White House. At that time the comm center
                    was on the TERP system, which was an optical scanner system. It used sort of
                    funny shaped letters and a special IBM Selectric ball. Since everything had to
                    be perfect on the page it was virtually impossible to make a correction. You
                    couldn't erase a character and put a new one in because it wouldn't line up
                    perfectly and that would screw up the optical scanner. That meant we had to let
                    typos go or retype an entire page to correct one character. Before TERP, when
                    comm center people still keyed texts themselves, almost any correction would
                    work.</p>
                <p>TERP would have been wonderful if we had had word processors. Nobody did. We were
                    still using electric typewriters. That is a good example of badly managed
                    technological change, because somebody should have said to our comm centers,
                    “No, you can't use TERP until we have word processors, because it doesn't make
                    any sense.” What they were doing when they said they would not process a message
                    unless it was on the TERP system was shifting part of their workload down to the
                    sections that generated the telegrams. Time and money were being saved in the
                    comm center, but the saving to the government was phony - probably even a net
                    loss - because all the sections and agencies generating cable traffic were
                    spending much more time. That sort of thing should not happen. That's a bad
                    management failure.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>At any rate, USIA did it better. Driven by the need to keep ourselves current in
                    media terms, we got into satellite technology really early. We installed our
                    TVROs, big satellite dishes that enabled us to do interactive television
                    broadcasts. We could Secretary X up on the screen, with a two way audio circuit
                    that was just phone lines. We really could stage long distance press
                    conferences. If the Mexican press needed to have a session with Doris Meisner of
                    INS, we could do it.</p>
                <p>Once we got that technology into place, we began to figure out that we could, at
                    reasonable cost, keep the satellite circuits up all the time and could embed
                    other signals within the video signal. Imagine a big circle - a big information
                    rich stream - and around the periphery of that circle you can put in audio
                    circuits or data circuits that don't require a whole lot of space within the
                    spectrum. We were quickly receiving the wireless file through the satellite
                    system. That made it a lot more efficient, much faster and a whole lot
                    cheaper.</p>
                <p>When I was press attach? in Tel Aviv, we were haunted by the specter of the noon
                    briefing. The noon briefer, usually the State Department spokesman, at least two
                    days out of five, would say something about Israel, and we would have a hell of
                    a time finding out what it was he said. About the only way I could do it as
                    press attach? was to get on the phone with somebody I knew in the press office
                    who would tell me what the spokesman had said. That depended on whether they had
                    been paying attention or not. Did they have time to take the phone call? How
                    senior could we get? It required a new negotiation every time to get the
                    information. By the time I was in Mexico, we, and every other USIS post, could
                    tune into the State Department briefing and watch it. We could even get a
                    transcript in a couple of hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the embassy as a structure? What was your
                        impression during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It was an annoying embassy. Of course, it is very big and it has all
                    sorts of folks in it. But it is not an encouraging place to work. I don't know
                    quite how to describe it. I noticed that every time something would go wrong,
                    somebody would say, “Well, this is the biggest embassy in the world, you know.”
                    That may reveal something of our mentality in that we offered that as an excuse
                    for not being able to do something. I could just as well have served as a reason
                    why we should have been able to almost anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>Also, the embassy is home to a lot of agency heads who had a lot of clout, and
                    that is a great frustration for the Department of State. When as the head of a
                    constituent agency you hear this complaint ad nauseum from State colleagues you
                    begin to feel that you would like to get the person by the lapel and say, “Well
                    for heaven sakes negotiate with us. That's what you are supposed to be good at.
                    You are the Department of State. You are diplomats. If you can't deal with the
                    relative power of agency heads within your own government, what on earth would
                    make you think you are at all capable of dealing with a bunch of foreigners who
                    don't even share that level of interest with you?”</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Mexico there were a lot of people in my organization that were
                    absolutely convinced that we were getting screwed, that embassy admin was sort
                    of hostile to USIS, that we would get the substandard housing and that the Admin
                    counselor was working overtime to take over the USIS motor pool because we had
                    more cars than he did. None of this was true, with the possible exception of
                    housing.</p>
                <p>Housing was very tight in Mexico and the new housing standards were in, which
                    made it difficult. Being the housing officer was an unwelcome duty that got
                    foisted on one of the more junior Americans in the section, and it was a
                    problem. I am convinced that the best housing was held back for State Department
                    people, unless somebody really screamed. That's a dumb philosophy because you
                    are going to hear a lot of screaming. One convincing instance will become
                    anecdotal evidence that will create resistance all through the system.</p>
                <p>There was sort of split in the embassy between the people who did diplomacy and
                    people who did law enforcement. As I said before, I have sympathy for the
                    enforcement people, because it was damn difficult to enforce laws across the
                    Mexican U.S. border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went up to the border one time and spent a night there.
                        My God, it is an eye opener.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Oh, it's a fascinating world up there. We kept a USIS officer in
                    Tijuana. For administrative and budgetary reasons, we didn't want to call it a
                    branch USIS post, but we stationed an officer there with basic resources of a
                    USIS post and called it a Border Affairs Office. I had people point out how
                    crummy the town was and wonder why we kept people there. That was where the real
                    problems were, and it was also where a lot of the energy was. The creativity
                    that results in making the U.S. Mexican relationship better, often comes from
                    the border areas. It's in San Diego and Monterrey you are going to get some of
                    the good ideas that might make things work.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>But anyway, it's a tough embassy and I don't think anybody really likes working
                    in those great big embassies. You had a lot of people who had uninteresting
                    jobs. The visa section is about as tough as it gets. I had a window on it
                    because my daughter happened to be stationed there as a junior State Department
                    officer on her first tour abroad. She had some awful stories to tell about the
                    visa section - even the physical arrangements were bad. We finally had got away
                    from making people wait outdoors by building this shelter, a roof over one of
                    the parking lots with benches in it, that gave people a place to wait for their
                    turn to get up to the window. In a display of stunning insensitivity we
                    habitually referred to that as the “visa barn.” What kind of mentality does that
                    reveal? We could have called it the pavilion, or something else, anything, but
                    we persisted in calling it the visa barn. That's terrible. I couldn't get people
                    to stop doing it.</p>
                <p>There are some terms we are fond of that make us feel better but surely must have
                    negative effect on the other person. What did we do when we had a Congressman
                    coming to visit the country? We assign somebody to take charge of that visit,
                    and we call them the control officer. Do you think that Congressman likes the
                    idea that he has somebody controlling him? Do you think we really are in
                    control? The term also gives ridiculous expectations to this junior officer who
                    has the job for the first time. “Oh, boy, I get to control a Congressman.” In
                    your dreams you do! Why can't we use terms like “liaison officer” or whatever? I
                    guess because we use the terms that make us feel better, regardless of the
                    effect on the job at hand.</p>
                <p>Citizen services in Mexico is a really weird business. This is the country where
                    an indigent, crazy, homeless, American can get on a bus and arrive in Mexico
                    City. You deal with problems in Mexico involving American citizens that are
                    almost unimaginable. It is unlike other countries with the possible exception of
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>Part of the embassy's problem is, of course, under funding, but part of the
                    problem is also that the Department doesn't make the best use of what it has. I
                    reluctantly have come to the conclusion that our political sections are too big,
                    and our consular sections way too small. I'm reluctant because political stuff
                    is really hard.</p>
                <p>Q: You don't need as much reporting as before, just a couple of good reporters to
                    make contacts and report.</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: We start from a philosophy that says the reporting should be
                    comprehensive. The fact is, I think, we should reorganize our reporting around
                    two poles, maybe three. One is, you report on those issues concerning which
                    there are ongoing negotiations between the two governments. Second, you try to
                    be alert to places where the press has gotten it really wrong, where you may
                    have to do some reporting to correct wrong impressions within the department or
                    in the host country. Third, you organize your reporting around the mandated
                    stuff, the human rights report, whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a certain amount of contact work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: The contact work is hard, but that should be shared. There are a lot
                    of people doing contact that don't think very much in reporting terms. Maybe
                    part of the job of political sections ought to be spending more time with other
                    people in the embassy than they do. That sounds contrary to popular wisdom, but
                    in some ways political section people spending more time with DEA people, USIA
                    people, AID people, and other folks like that might be a good idea. I am afraid
                    the impression at a lot of embassies, on the part of people in the other
                    agencies, is that the political section holds itself aloof, as if too much
                    contact would be contaminating. You don't want to fall into the trap where your
                    political people are spending all their time hobnobbing with other Americans in
                    the embassy and not getting out there where they ought to be, but a certain
                    amount of time incorporating what people in other sections and agencies know
                    into political reporting would be well spent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the unrest started in Chiapas when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: It started while I was there. That was that funny January of 1992,
                    right after the elections. Mexico got a double whammy, with the beginning of a
                    rebellion in Chiapas, and a terrific slide of the peso in relation to the
                    dollar. When you think back, you remember the prime PRI candidate was
                    assassinated. Then they fixed upon Ernesto Zedillo, the education minister. This
                    was a man who had not been groomed to run for the presidency; a very good
                    education minister; educated at Yale, and a very sound economist. A good man who
                    has made a good president in Mexico. He has carried on the Salinas legacy
                    without the Salinas burden. Nobody laid a glove on him when it came to the kind
                    of accusations of corruption that ruined Salinas' reputation and life. Salinas
                    lives in exile in Ireland, which is an absurd fate for a Mexican president.
                    Mexican presidents usually live in honor and dignity in Mexico, without huge
                    amounts of influence, but that is the way it is supposed to be.</p>
                <p>The election itself was observed to the hilt. I talked about how in El Salvador
                    during the last days of the Jesuit trial, and my perception that the NGOs (Non
                    Governmental Organizations) were rapidly shifting their focus to Guatemala. I
                    think during my time in Mexico it had begun to shift out of Guatemala to Mexico,
                    because of NAFTA. All of a sudden the nature of Mexico, and Mexico as a proper
                    ally of the United States became a debatable thing, and the NGOs could see a lot
                    of the things that were wrong in Mexico, a lot of things they didn't like. That
                    meant the Mexican elections were filled with observers. The Mexican government
                    started out, especially under the naive influence of the foreign ministry,
                    trying to control who was going to be an election observer. I think a major
                    accomplishment of the embassy, in which USIS had a role, was convincing the
                    Mexican government they didn't have to control everybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>If you cannot control it to the point where you only get the observers you want,
                    what is your next best course? The next best would be to throw it open to
                    everybody, then you could say you didn't control the observers. That serves you
                    well there, and also here, because you don't have to take responsibility. All
                    you have to do is offer the facilities you offer to the press, and you already
                    know how to do that. I attended a number of briefings for NGO and election
                    observers where the Mexican government very patiently laid out a very
                    complicated electoral system, and it was unassailable. The elections came out
                    looking pretty good all over the country. There were a few instances where
                    people could say the lines were too long, and some people didn't get to vote
                    down in Oaxaca, but nearly everybody said it wasn't on purpose. Mexico came out
                    of that looking pretty good.</p>
                <p>Chiapas? I guess it's another one of those classic intelligence things. I would
                    like to tell you that there were those of us in the embassy who saw this coming,
                    but that would not be true. We didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is not a place you would particularly go to
                        either, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: No, I had been there occasionally but it is pretty far away. We don't
                    understand it very well down there. Chiapas is more like Guatemala than it is
                    like most of Mexico. That official Mexico City based ideology that says, “We are
                    all Indians and we are part of this cosmic race that occurred in the New World,
                    this wonderful mixture of Indian Hispanic tradition” doesn't penetrating down
                    into the Mayan country of southern Mexico.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of local irritants, and a lot of the Chiapas revolt focused on
                    Mexico City not paying attention, but the real issues were a dispute between
                    absentee or foreign landlords and local folks that hadn't been resolved.
                    Landlords claiming more land than they really owned, and people of indigenous
                    culture claiming land that maybe they didn't really own. A lot of irritants were
                    land based and culturally based. These local irritants in the hands of some
                    fairly ambitious political operatives resulted in a minor armed revolt, and if
                    you toted up the battles and the gun fire, there had never was a whole lot to
                    it. Much of it has been a war of press releases, a war of television coverage,
                    and a war on the Internet.</p>
                <p>Some of it was made possible by the fact that there was excess guerilla talent
                    coming out of El Salvador and Guatemala, that could be applied to the game.
                    There were people who knew how to fight guerilla wars and there were people with
                    a lot of guns. Anybody that thinks we have picked up all the weapons in El
                    Salvador, has not been paying attention. A huge amount of armament was also
                    available in Guatemala in a war that was entering into more of a negotiation
                    stage than it had been before.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>The Mexican government is in the same dilemma most governments are. No matter
                    what your military people tell you, the human rights and political cost of
                    totally stamping out a rebellion like that simply isn't worth the game. It's way
                    too high. Despite the fact that a few telephone poles get blown up, the Mexican
                    government is smart enough not to turn Chiapas into El Salvador.</p>
                <p>The slide of the peso was much more disastrous in Mexico, because it took the
                    bloom ofNAFTA right away in terms of what expectations on both sides of the
                    border had been. It made it harder for Mexico to benefit, and it also made it
                    harder for the United States to benefit. Remember, the big issue while I was in
                    Mexico had been ratification in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '95?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: In '95, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I came back to Washington and understood that retirement was getting
                    pretty close. I was unassigned for awhile, and then they asked if I would sit in
                    as the Deputy Director of the Far East Division of USIA. About a year later, in
                    May, I retired.</p>
                <p>Q: What since your retirement?</p>
                <p>DIETERICH: Since my retirement I have been dividing my time between my summer
                    place on Lake Erie and here in Arlington. I am now president of the USIA Alumna
                    Association. That job has gotten more interesting since the incorporation of
                    USIA into the State Department. We are active, and hope influential, in getting
                    the Department to adopt the best practices of what USIA did in the old days. We
                    have a membership of about 600 people and new members coming in because now
                    everyone is an alumnus of USIA. We are concerned that ex USIA people receive
                    equitable treatment in the Department. We work closely with ASFA, much more
                    closely than we did before. The summers are sacred. I am up on Lake Erie
                    sailing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we will stop at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DIETERICH: I think that's it.</p>
