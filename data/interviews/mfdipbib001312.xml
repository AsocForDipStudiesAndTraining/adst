                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape one, side one with Louise Armstrong. This is
                        being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training,
                        and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Today is January 13, 2000. Well, can we
                        start at the beginning, can you tell me when and where you were born and
                        something about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes. I was born in Tokyo, November 16, 1917. My parents were
                    missionaries to Japan. They had gone to Japan two years before I was born. They
                    spent the two years, those two years in Tokyo, where they were taking extensive,
                    intensive language training in Japanese. They were later moved to one of our
                    mission posts north of Sendai, Aizuwakamatsu. In due course my father would have
                    been the principal of a girl's college in Sendai, which was sponsored by our
                    church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sendai is in northern Honshu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes. This is the, what was then the German Reformed Church, or the
                    Reformed Church of the United States, as distinct from the Dutch Reformed
                    Church, which had basically the same theology. But because it settled in
                    Manhattan and is relatively well off, from a real estate standpoint, it didn't
                    have to merge, whereas the German Reformed Church made a number of mergers and
                    it's finally the United Church of Christ.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family's name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: My father was Paul Franklin Schaffner. And my mother was Sarah Hording
                    Schaffner. S c h a ff n e r.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your mother and father's backgrounds?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: My father was from Harrisburg, and his father was a lawyer. And he
                    went to Franklin and Marshall Academy in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And then to
                    Franklin and Marshall College. And then to seminary, the Reformed Church
                    Seminary in Lancaster.</p>
                <p>And my mother was a graduate of high school in Lancaster, and had gone on to
                    study voice at a conservatory in Philadelphia. But I couldn't tell you if it's
                    still in existence. And she was a schoolteacher and a professional singer. She
                    sang at churches, whenever they did “The Messiah” or something like that, she
                    would be the soprano soloist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a child, did you grow up in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I spent the first six years in Japan. I celebrated my sixth birthday
                    on the way to the United States. My parents were given a furlough, as they
                    called it, every seven years. The seven years expired, and we set out to come
                    home. And we came the long way, that is, across the Pacific, and stopped various
                    interesting places. I celebrated my sixth birthday in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: We were due a furlough of two years. And during those two years, my
                    parents worked out of Lancaster. My father had to go about preaching and
                    recruiting and of course raising money for the church. And my mother did her bit
                    by going along and singing the solos at the various churches. But that was the
                    first year. The second year they were on their own and were entitled to do what
                    they wanted, preferably something to further their career. My father studied at
                    Boston University. And my mother studied at the Peabody Conservatory in Boston.
                    And we lived in the suburb of BostoWinthrop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by this time, you were eight years old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, so that I was eight years old when I returned to Japan with my
                    parents. And it wasn't long before my father took ill, and I think he died
                    within six months. He developed an acute form of diabetes, and there was no
                    insulin. My mother thought it best to come back to her home, which was
                    Lancaster. So I grew up in Lancaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Lancaster until about when? This would be,
                        we're talking about </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Until I went to college, which was 1934.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like in school, with your mother and all in
                        Lancaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Very pleasant. My mother is fond of saying that Lancaster is a good
                    place in which to grow up. And she was quite right. There were several planes of
                    society there. There were simple folk who still spoke with an accent they
                    brought back from the Old Country, not just the Pennsylvania Dutch, but some of
                    the English speaking people. Then there were other more sophisticated types and
                    old families. It was a nice mix of people, and it was very safe, very sedate,
                    God fearing. And it had Franklin and Marshall College and the Seminary to give
                    it some intellectual stimulation.</p>
                <p>Q: Well now, where did you go to grammar school?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: In Lancaster, in public schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I don't know what to say about that, but I started at the local
                    primary school, and this is after I was aged six initially. Then six to seven, I
                    was in the local primary school. Seven to eight I was in the school in Winthrop,
                    Massachusetts. And then when I came back, I went into third grade, I guess. I'd
                    been taught by the Calvert Method when I was overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a correspondence course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Correspondence, right, correspondence method, which was a very good
                    school. And I skipped a grade or two because I was in advance of my classes in
                    that respect. Then [I] moved from that school to a school that went up through
                    grade six to eight. Then nine to ten, still another school. Then finished in
                    high school two more years. It was an odd way they segregated the years. But I
                    had primary school and junior high and high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly as we move into junior high, high school,
                        were there any subjects you were particularly interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I always enjoyed English, and I tolerated math and I tolerated
                    Physics, things of that sort. I didn't have much opportunity with history,
                    political science. They were weak, very weak in their teaching of that.</p>
                <p>Q: How about during, a good part of this period you were in high school, in 1929,
                    the Depression hit. Did that have much effect?</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Oh, very much so. I don't think we were nearly as affected as some
                    people. Because somehow my mother had a certain amount of funding from the
                    church for the children. She had no insurance, other than that. But the church
                    provided for the children, and she managed with that and her singing and
                    teaching to keep us fairly comfortable in a pleasant house in downtown
                    Lancaster. When we got older, she realized it had become more expensive, so she
                    went afield to try and earn some money on a regular basis. And she took a course
                    in journalism at the University of Wisconsin in the summer and came back and
                    went into the advertising department of one of the local department stores. And
                    then later [she] moved to the advertising department of the Armstrong Cork
                    Products Company, which is not Armstrong World Products Company. That and a
                    Hamilton Watch and Staley Silk Mill and an umbrella factory were the principal
                    employers of people in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you read a lot, on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I did, but I wasn't conscious of being bookish. I was much more
                    interested in being out of doors. I was a tomboy. I climbed trees and played
                    baseball and did things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, the financial constraints and all, what did you
                        think about going away to university, college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I wanted to do it. And I had probably the option of going to a
                    local college, like Millersville State Teachers College, which is now a full
                    fledged college. But we had friends who had gone to Wellesley, and they
                    encouraged me in that direction. And I received some sponsorship from them and
                    also a scholarship.</p>
                <p>Q: So you were in Wellesley from '34 to what?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: '38.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '38. What was Wellesley like then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Delightful. Trouble is, it was too much fun, too distracting. A
                    beautiful campus. The pleasures of being in a community of people who were in
                    some fashion interesting or stimulating. It was great. Winters were splendid.
                    Springs were beautiful. I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you taking a lot of the Harvard courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No, no, that had not started. But we never had any reason to think
                    that we were not well served by the faculty. Talking with people from Harvard,
                    whom I knew, who were my contemporaries, I didn't think they were being taught
                    any better than I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, probably not, because you were probably getting, it
                        wasn't a, you were probably getting a more concentrated set of studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Oh, yes, we didn't have the tutorial system, which would have been
                    nice. I think I would have enjoyed that enormously. But we had excellent
                    professors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did, was there a missionary carryover at Wellesley
                        at that time, sort of a missionary mafia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No, I wouldn't say so. There was one other girl with missionary
                    parentage in my dormitory, and I never knew any other. But we did have foreign
                    students, and of course we had the Madame Chiang Kai-shek class heritage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, I think of the, what was it, the Koo
                        Sisters in Wellington, I'm not sure, whatever the sisters were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I know; I'm groping for it myself. But we didn't have a great deal of
                    that at Wellesley. We had a lot of foreign students. I remember one girl, who
                    was from the Middle East, a friend of mine, and she said, “You wash your hair in
                    the wintertime?” Now I believe it's very different. They depend very heavily on
                    foreign students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wouldn't be surprised. What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: English literature, [with a] minor in English Composition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular field in English literature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I took the usual history and economics as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the sort of, during this period was the period
                        of the New Deal and all that, were there some sharp debates, I can see
                        Wellesley, with people coming out of families, many of them from the well to
                        do, who really weren't great fans of Roosevelt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: There wasn't a lot of political sentiment on the campus that I was
                    aware of. We didn't have a lot of meetings that I was aware of. It had its
                    clubs, which was not a sorority, on campus. There were a lot of clubs, but I
                    never felt that they were anything but social. It was a period of approaching
                    war in Europe, and I remember feeling very strongly that I didn't want American
                    boys to have to be in that war. I changed my tune in later life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. But that was very strong then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It was very strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Well, getting out in 1938, where were you pointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I moved into first, the Hamilton Watch Factory, first job that I
                    could get. And that was sorting artificial diamonds for watches, a very
                    simpleminded job. Then I worked in the Science Press, which was the press, which
                    published, the official organ of the American Association for the Advancement of
                    Science, the AAAS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Scientific America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, Scientific America, things of that sort. I'm sure they've moved
                    to other publishing houses, but this is where a lot of it was done. And I had
                    the job of proof and manuscript reader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. This seemed to be the prime occupation of graduates of the
                        Seven Sisters schools, being first rate proofreaders at the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I'm sure it's true because you either did that or you went to Katie
                    Gibbs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Yeah, Katie Gibbs being the secretarial school.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Right. At any rate, I wanted to go to New York and see what I could do
                    for myself there. So I eventually set off with one or two introductions. It took
                    me a while to get into anything very solid. But I did finally work for Time and
                    Life. And it was while I was there that, as a so called researcher?</p>
                <p>As a researcher you went along with the photographer and got all the materials
                    that related to the story that was being shot, or you helped to evolve the story
                    in the first place, the concept of it and then went along with the photographer.
                    But you also, if you worked in some areas, the responsibility was to check the
                    accuracy of the stories that were churned out by the writers, but since some of
                    them were pretty, how would you say, high flown in their style, making or
                    developing theses as they went along, you found you had to reign them in a
                    little bit on a factual basis.</p>
                <p>And I did have the experience of reading what Clare Booth Luce sent back from a
                    trip she made to the Far East, during the war this was, when she joined up with
                    the Flying Tigers and General Stilwell and people like that and made stops, hop
                    skipping around the Pacific. And her reports would come back, and I had the job
                    of reading them from a factual standpoint. And basically, she was pretty
                    reliable, a little fast and loose, but pretty reliable. However, when it came to
                    names, I felt I needed some type of corroboration for the spelling, the names
                    and things like that. Very easy to make mistakes in recording from the scene. So
                    when she would get back from these trips, I would call her at the Waldorf and
                    talk to her, rather I talked to secretary, and I'd sawould you ask Mrs. Luce if
                    she can confirm this or corroborate that or spell this and so forth? One day I
                    called and I got right through to the lady herself. And she said to me, “Mrs.
                    Armstrong, what have I done wrong now?” Very pleasant lady. She wasn't being
                    nasty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you initiated into sort of the unique Time writing
                        style at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I never did any actual writing. It was while I was working for
                    Life magazine, which at that point was developing a magazine for the armed
                    forces, which would not only give them news but also would help them in
                    identifying foreign and American airplanes, tanks, ships and so forta
                    recognition training process. And that took me to Washington on a number of
                    occasions. And it seemed to me everybody was going overseas except me, so I
                    began to look into the possibility of doing something overseas. And I heard from
                    one friend of mine that he was being hired by ANRA, I think it was.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I decided to walk into the State Department, while I was down there, and I asked
                    if I could have an appointment with somebody in foreign service personnel. In
                    due course I was introduced to the chief of foreign service personnel, and that
                    was in the Old Executive Office Building. He waved me to my seat and said he
                    understood I was interested in the foreign service. I said, “Yes, but not in an
                    officer capacity.” And I said, “Is that possible?” Well he tilted himself back
                    in his swivel chair and put the tips of his fingers together and said,
                    “Conceivably.” And so somewhat to my astonishment I discovered that State
                    Department security was investigating me. My boss in New York would say, “What's
                    going on here?” And the woman who owned the apartment where I was staying, she
                    was frightened out of her wits because security people had come to interrogate
                    her about me.</p>
                <p>And then they made me the offer of joining the Foreign Service Auxiliary, which
                    you've probably heard about. And that was for, on the duration of the emergency
                    basis. And we were given a course of sprouts in everything under the sun, a
                    couple of months of this. And I wasn't very long into it before an announcement
                    was made of three posts open for bids. And I was afraid I'd get something like
                    Tegucigalpa, so when I heard that these three posts were open for bids, I
                    pricked up my ears. One was Afghanistan; one was Jerusalem; one was Madras. I
                    didn't think I'd be considered for Kabul, and I thought Jerusalem might be
                    pretty depressing. And I'd read A Passage to India, E.M. Forster, so I had
                    romantic ideas about India, so therefore I offered my services there. And then
                    as I understand it, the Department made little discreet inquiries among people
                    who had served in India, old India hands, as to whether this young woman would
                    go down in the vice consul capacity in Madras, and they seemed to think there
                    was no problem. So I was the first woman officer in India. And before I left
                    there were about six others gathered around various consular posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Madras when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I arrived in January '44.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I sailed out of Hoboken on a passenger cargo vessel that was the Hurg
                    Silverstar, Norwegians vessel. And we traveled in convoy, across the Atlantic,
                    until we got to the Mediterranean by which time it was Marc Nostrum, we were
                    free of the convoy business so we moved faster. And [we] went into Karachi.
                    Apart from Suez, that was the only stop we made. At Karachi, I was expected,
                    that is my boss to be in Madras had been in touch with the consular general in
                    Karachi, and he'd made all kinds of plans for me, which made me fly Tada
                    Airlines to Madras. Now Tada Airlines is a little bi plane with about six
                    passengers. Had to stop over in Secunderabad, which is the twin city of
                    Hyderabad, where Tada had its own little hotel, airport hotel arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>And interestingly enough I noticed among the half dozen passengers that there was
                    an older middle aged woman with graying hair, black graying hair, who wore a
                    sari but was plainly not Indian. Olive skin and the sari and these leather shoes
                    that you wear in North India, with a turned up toe. And I thought this is
                    interesting, she is what they say has “gone native.” But she was an interesting,
                    arresting figure, accompanied by a younger man who spoke English as well as
                    whatever he spoke to her in. I read her name off the sign in roster when we got
                    to the hotel, and she was Maria Montessori. She was traveling around India
                    fulfilling speaking engagements with her nephew doing the interpreting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Maria Montessori established this preschool
                        system-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Everywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:which is everywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Very big in India, or was. I'm sure it's still there. So anyway, one
                    flew by way of Hyderabad, Secunderabad, overnight there. With nothing better to
                    do, a group of us went into the local bazaar at night and that was fascinating.
                    The craftsman were working by charcoal fires, beautiful stuff, all very
                    inexpensive. I bought a dozen bracelets.</p>
                <p>And then the next morning we set off for Madras. And there it was understood that
                    my boss to be, he would meet me. It was a two officer post, Madras. And Roy
                    Bauer, who had been in the post for some time [and] was very much settled in
                    there, was to have met me. And then a message reached me at the airport that he
                    couldn't leave the office and would I please take a taxi in to the hotel where I
                    was registered and then meet him for lunch at The Madras Club. I found a fellow
                    passenger who was going in; we shared a cab. Looking out of the plane as we
                    approached Madras, it looked very arid and empty, and I thought, “Geez, two
                    three years here, can I stand it?” Then as we drove in to the town, it happened
                    to be after the monsoon so it was a lot greener than it might have been, in fact
                    a lot of green paddy fields everywhere, but kind of a rundown situation.
                    Everything you saw looked in a state of decay, if not from dry weather then from
                    humid weather. And not very reassuring. And part way into town, in the middle of
                    the country, the taxi broke down. The driver managed to flag another car. That
                    car towed us and just as we approached the near middle of the town, the tow rope
                    broke. I finally got to my hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A great introduction!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. Having arrived at the hotel, I then went on to the
                    Madras Club. First thing my boss did was order me a gimlet, my first experience
                    with gimlets. And with a British Indian club. It was really very agreeable, and
                    just what I needed was a drink at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1944 t?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: '47, September '47. I left one month after Indian Independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Madras like at that time? Particularly when you
                        just arrived, still wartime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes. Well first thing that Mr. Bauer did, over a drink and then over
                    lunch, was to explain the social situation to me. Quite clearly I was not to
                    drop any bricks or make any gaffes. The society was dominated by the British
                    Civil Service, ICS, Indian Civil Service really. There was a British governor
                    and his aides were all British. The chiefs of all the administrative offices
                    were British. And then there were Britishers who were there in business, import
                    export, manufacturers, cotton and things like that. And there were British
                    military.</p>
                <p>And the situation was such socially, there was a housing shortage, that is, a
                    housing shortage of the West and England. I'm sure there was always a housing
                    shortage for Indians. So the people doubled up, and as my boss explained to me,
                    sometimes the husband would be sent home and couldn't get back, having left his
                    wife behind. And there would be somebody else who needed a place to live, so
                    they would have a paying guest system. And you would have some interesting
                    situations where So and so was sharing a house with Lady So and so, but they
                    didn't have the same last name. And he just wanted to let me understand that
                    such situations existed, from the social point of view so I wouldn't be
                    misled.</p>
                <p>He also said that there was one particular charming younger woman who attended
                    all the social functions, as a somewhat unattached woman, I think she was
                    separated from her husband. But she was hired by the British Intelligence, so
                    that anything that got to her ears went straight to Intelligence. They had put
                    her in that situation because so many soldiers would come through, officers
                    through Madras, and they would have time on their hands looking for recreation
                    and go to the several clubs that were open to them. And if they talked too much,
                    she would be there to pick it up. And that was among some other responsibilities
                    I'm sure.</p>
                <p>He also told me in local correspondence I should be very careful of what I said
                    because there were a number of British housewives who were employed to read this
                    kind of thing. So my letters would invariably be screened.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Then there was the missionary community, which was very significant. We had about
                    a thousand missionaries in the consular district, which included the state of
                    Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore, three Indian states - they all have different
                    names now - and Madras, Presidency as it was called then. So missionaries were
                    scattered all over this south Indian area, which was really the lower half of
                    the Indian peninsula. And Roy Bauer was on very good terms with them; they
                    enjoyed coming and chatting with him. He was a very approachable, easy
                    conversationalist. He had a remarkable faculty for getting happily along with
                    the British, the stuffiest Britishers, because he'd served in England, he'd
                    served in Singapore, he was quite comfortable with British ways. In fact he
                    would correct me from time to time. I was not to say “stupid,” I was to say
                    “schtupid,” can you hear the difference? Because that's the way the British said
                    [it]. He was also very comfortable with the local American community, which was
                    small. But the missionaries were a great source of intelligence for us.</p>
                <p>We would report on all kinds of things as they happened in our area. We would
                    report, you see we didn't have an embassy yet in Delhi, we had the personal
                    representative of the United States. Then in due course when it was clear that
                    we were going to have an embassy, we had a charg�. And the first ambassador I
                    broke in for, I'll have to take time on that, but never mind?.We would send
                    these reports back to both to Delhi and to Washington, for what they were worth.
                    Basically we didn't have a great deal of trouble in south India. The problems
                    that arose were chiefly in the north. Because we had a very modest Muslim
                    community. They gave nobody any trouble, and nobody troubled them. We had some
                    other interesting curiosities, but mostly it was a very stable community in that
                    sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at the Indian Congress Party and the
                        Gandhi general movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, we had a close friend in a woman congressman, and I made friends
                    with another woman who had been a congresswoman. We had visits from Gandhi, from
                    time to time. He would come down. I shared a platform with him. By a platform I

                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. The interesting thing for me was one heard so much about
                    his fasting and his general self sacrifice. But when I saw him in person, I
                    never saw somebody who was better fleshed out than he was. I understood in his
                    fasting, when it took place, included in his diet orange juice and goat's milk,
                    which was a lot better than most Indians had by way of a good diet. And when he
                    traveled third class, in the third class car - third class in India had nothing
                    but the bench around the periphery of the car, with most people sitting on the
                    floor - this third class car was mostly Gandhi and his party. So it wasn't as if
                    he had to sleep on the floor if he didn't want to. I admired him a lot, but he
                    didn't have any great time for Americans. I suspect only for Britishers with
                    whom he had to do business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As vice consul, what were your jobs? What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I had a certain amount of rubber stamping of invoices, enormous amount
                    of invoices. Of rosters of port, and during the war time, we had a lot of
                    American ships come in, so there was some so called shipping. But since we
                    didn't have a Coast Guard there, if there was any serious problem, we'd refer
                    them to Calcutta or to Ceylon, to Colombo. Because you always had incidents on
                    cargo ships where there was some kind of a fracas going on. Some seaman was a
                    problem or some captain was a problem. But I didn't have to deal with that type
                    of thing directly. The invoicing was big. There was a community of Americans
                    working in Bangalore with the Hindustan Aircraft Corporation, which was the
                    beginning in the sense of, Bangalore is now the “silicon valley” of India.
                    Bangalore Aircraft Corporation serviced the codas and other planes </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The codas being the DC 3.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. And also serviced military aircraft. And some which
                    later flew the hump. We had a group of American technicians and engineers
                    working there which inevitably cohabited with Anglo Indian woman. And inevitably
                    there were children and some consular matters involving them. And we had
                    consular matters involving the American community, of which I said we had about
                    1,000. And then I was expected to mingle socially, which was very agreeable. And
                    as I say do reporting. The more commercial economic reporting would be done by
                    the chief Indian clerk, but it would go out under my name because I would report
                    it. We did oil seeds reporting and reporting on coconut products and things of
                    that sort, mainly for the Department of Agriculture I think, to some extent for
                    Commerce. And any political reporting that we could sniff out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Consul sort of under the instructions to watch
                        this Indian Independence movement closely?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, we just assumed we were under instructions if we weren't, and
                    [we'd] report anything we thought was worthwhile. But as I say there wasn't a
                    great deal going on in south India. South India was just moving with the
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the war effort? Was it your impression that the
                        Indians you got to know, were they with the war effort or did they feel it
                        was a British war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Oh, distinctly detached. In fact there was such a thing as the Indian
                    National Army, which was working with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Burma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, also in India. And the daughter of this congresswoman was
                    involved in that. She wasn't living in Madras very much, so it was just quietly
                    spoken about. Yes she was very much involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your contact with Indians? The British were
                        still in charge, but was there an Indian class that you </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, there was an Indian community that one would regard as just as
                    easy to mingle with as the British. One of the things I liked to do was to
                    escape from the domain of the Raj now and again. You knew that if you spent all
                    your time with Indians that it would create a bad impression, so you had to be a
                    little careful. But I had quite a number of Indian friends who were what you
                    would call upper class, prosperous, and I enjoyed learning about India through
                    them. They provided opportunities like the missionaries. The missionaries were
                    much closer to the Indians and the officials, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at the end of the war, which would be August of
                        '45, did that change things at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It didn't make too much difference immediately in south India. In
                    north India, there were already riots, even before Indian independence. I went
                    up, I joined the Foreign Service in the auxiliary, and then I was prepared to
                    take the written examinations. They were provided, at a certain point, by
                    courier. And I was going to be able to sit in my own office and take the
                    examination with my supervisor next door, so to speak. The courier was a day
                    late, after I'd done my best to bone up for this examination, I found I had to
                    wait for the next one to come along because it was considered, that particular
                    examination had been, what's the word you want?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Compromised?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Compromised. So when I finally took it, which was about six months
                    later, and was discovered to have passed it I was told that I would be
                    interviewed by a panea traveling panel. A traveling panel came to Bombay, and I
                    went up to Bombay for that occasion. There was a very well known man, named Joe
                    Green, and everybody said he would the holy terror. And it turned out he was a
                    very fatherly type. At any rate I passed the orals, as far as I could tell, I
                    think they told me at the time. Then I had to pass the physical. The consulate
                    in Bombay sent me to a doctor that they had in mind, and I found myself stark
                    naked jumping up and down on one foot and then the other for this guy. No nurses
                    or nothing. You put up with a lot in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>From there I went on to Kashmir. My mother, by the way, had come to India to join
                    me about two thirds of the way through. She and an American woman whose husband
                    had been Young Men Christian Association (YMCA) secretary, the three of us were
                    going to Kashmir together. She and my mother went on ahead, and I went on from
                    Bombay. One went part of the way by train, up to Peshawar, and then a bus from
                    there up to Srinagar. And I could see burning villages on the ridges across the
                    way, at that time in the spring of '47. There was plenty of trouble already.</p>
                <p>Then when my mother and I came back we traveled separately from our friend, Marie
                    Buck. We got on board a train with a compartment reserved for us you couldn't
                    lock. The lock was faulty. And under normal circumstances you wouldn't feel too
                    worried about this. But under the circumstances, it wasn't very reassuring. And
                    at every point on the Indian railway's journey, they would stop and there would
                    be a great hubbub of crowds on the platform. That was very characteristic,
                    especially in North India. Crowded platforms where people would eat, sell tea,
                    sell this and that and eat fast foods of their kind. Any hour of day or night;
                    the Indian clock is continuous. So I found us in this unlockable compartment,
                    and I piled everything I could think of in terms of luggage. And I suggested
                    that my mother take the lower berth and I spent half the night screaming at
                    people to get away from the door, that it was private, that it was locked and so
                    forth, ready to leap on anybody who did push their way in. Well people pushed,
                    but nobody pushed their way in. But that was a situation I wouldn't have
                    encountered in south India. There was more turbulence and unruliness up
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Now in south India there was one episode that gave us concern really. A very fine
                    man who was a member of the high court, the Madras High Court, a Britisher,
                    Justice Byers - he and his wife were delightful, I enjoyed their hospitality
                    more than once - he for some reason had a revolver with him driving back from
                    the high courts, which were at the far end of town from where he lived at the
                    other end of town. His car was being pelted by boys throwing stones and it
                    unnerved him, and he thought the best thing to do was to fire a warning shot.
                    And he got out his pistol and he fired a warning shot and it hit a stone wall
                    and the bullet ricocheted and killed a boy. I have never seen a British
                    community so upset, and I'd never seen a man so shunned after that. He just
                    didn't stay in Madras. He lost his position, and he was out of there. He retired
                    to Vancouver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a certain amount of tension
                        between you and the American members, particularly you and the British
                        community and you know, our general feeling is anti colonial? Or had we sort
                        of been absorbed into the colonial society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I think my experience was in fact colored by the fact of Roy Bauer,
                    who was very pro British. Now mind you he was objective at the same time. And
                    the more I saw of the situation in south India, the more I was satisfied that
                    the Indian Civil Service was really a very well intentioned and well organized
                    civil service and very competent, in the sense that the young officer would go
                    out to a large district so he would be the only one there and somehow could be
                    responsible for local justice, local taxes and everything else. I thought they
                    handled the situation well. The railroads were their creation. And everything
                    India has today, to my way of thinking, is due to a very good colonial period.
                    When I was with Indians who were chafing at the British overrule, I could be
                    sympathetic with them as well.</p>
                <p>But I have to say I also admired the British. Now individual British senior
                    people could be a little stuffy. An American was not always considered to be of
                    the same class and status. But happily Mr. Bauer was very well established, and
                    that made a difference in their acceptance of me. I was the subject of a certain
                    amount of local gossip, which was the principal problem I had I would say,
                    because here I was, an unattached woman, circulating [with] a largely identified
                    group of people, some Indians. So my name was often being associated with
                    somebody or other, often with somebody I'd never heard of. Again, the only thing
                    to do was to forget about it, to laugh at it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well did you find, when you came into the Foreign Service, were you being
                    warned this isn't the place for a woman and that kind of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well I was only warned about the problem of Madras being a port and
                    unruly seamen would be coming in. So I have to tell my unruly seamen story. In
                    fact one man, I think he's the first person I talked to in the state department,
                    said, “You know, if you go to a place like Madras, I know of a woman foreign
                    service vice consul who kept a big monkey wrench on her desk and any time she
                    felt threatened she would rattle the monkey wrench.</p>
                <p>Well that didn't happen in my case, but in one instance when there was an
                    American cargo vessel in towand by the way we had constant vessels in town
                    because there was a big buildup for an invasion of Japan and there was a base
                    called Avodi, which was outside of Madras, so we had shipload after shipload of
                    aircraft parts, you name it. And these ships would frequently, almost
                    invariably, be American vessels. Well one day this chap came in and, shirt open
                    down to his belt buckle, he sits himself on the chair in front of my office and
                    my desk and throws one leg over the arm of the chair and leans back and says,
                    “Say, what is there to do in this town anyway?” Bauer had seen him come in. I
                    talked to hithere was the Gimkana Club he could go to, and there were movies. I
                    was scared to death he'd ask me for a date, and I'd have to say no thank you.
                    And he began to study me and he said, “Say, you look familiar, what's your
                    name?” And I told him Louise Schaffner. He says, “I went to school with you, I
                    went to grade school with you. My name's Panny Beanzirfer.” And I remembered
                    Panny Beanzirfer, and I said, “I'm going to have to write my grandmother about
                    you.” At that point, we had a few other words and then he took off. Roy Bauer
                    couldn't believe it. He couldn't believe it. I found it hard to believe too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to get seamen out of jail and things like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That we left to the Coast Guard. They would come in, the captain would
                    come in with some of the problems. Roy Bauer would talk to him and advise him
                    what we could and couldn't do. Mainly we should ship them off to the next port.
                    We also had problems with the local madam because these American seamen would
                    come in and tear the joint apart. I got such a kick out of that. She would come
                    in in this black dress, in the middle of the Madras summer heat and sit down in
                    his office. He was very polite and very bland. He told her, “So sorry. Nothing
                    we could do. Take it up with the police.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes it's handy to have good relations with the local
                        madams because they can sometimes keep Americans out of, they can sort of
                        inform the Consul before they inform the police.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I dare say. I don't know of any case like that coming up. Mostly it
                    was just these guys who would get drunk and raise hell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you left there in '47?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes. Incidentally, I'll tell you about Indian independence in Madras.
                    The date was the 15th, and it was at midnight because the 14th was an unlucky
                    [day]. Or the settlement with Mountbatten fell to the 15th. But the sky showed
                    that the 15th was an inauspicious day. So Indian independence was officially
                    effective as of midnight. Nehru was the one who organized it this way. At any
                    rate that night the whole downtown Madras was, of course, ablaze with lights and
                    sounds and music and dancing and what, I don't remember exactly. But the
                    governor of Madras, Sir Archibald Nigh, who was later to become the first
                    British High Commissioner, he had been deputy chief of the imperial general
                    staff during the war, which meant that he was a senior military man. And he was
                    a splendid man. And his wife was very interested in everything Indian. She made
                    a point of taking part in charities, which were for the benefit of the Indians.
                    The two of them and their, his aide, and my mother was invited, not me, my
                    mother, drove down to midtown Georgetown, which was the busy part of the Madras
                    harbor area to enjoy the celebrations. And nobody laid a hand on them. It was in
                    a jeep as a matter of fact. It wasn't in the official car, it was in a jeep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. A jeep, open.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: An open jeep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what was the feeling from Bauer and yourself about
                        [unknown word] India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I think most Americans felt that India was entitled to independence.
                    One's servants were very upset because they saw their established way of life as
                    crumbling. I think India did deteriorate, initially. And whether it has in some
                    fashion ever recovered, I doubt. I'm told I would see India very much changed.
                    And I'm sure I will; it would be magnificent, the changes. But also you know all
                    the troubles of India at this point too. So when the British left, they left a
                    good system, but the system was disbanded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '47 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: In '47 I went on home leave, and my appointment was to be Praja. And I
                    thought when I saw that, my gosh that must be in Latin America, [but] Praja's a
                    name for Prague. There's a place, Paraj, I believe in Brazil. And I was
                    confusing that in my mind. Well I found out differently. I had home leave, and I
                    had consultation. And I spent some time in the department talking to people who
                    were working on that area. And I was told that Steinhardt had just been there on
                    his home leave, the summer of '47, and had talked everywhere about
                    Czechoslovakia being the bridge between east and west. Literally, nobody was
                    alerted to the possibility of a coup and that was September, October, November,
                    December. I arrived in January '48 to Prague, and still, as far as I could see,
                    there wasn't anybody expecting any difficulties of the USSR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: My job was again third secretary vice consul, and I was put into the
                    political section initially. Then I was moved, no I was put in the economics
                    section initially. Then I was moved to political, and then the consular. You
                    were supposed to get a variety of experiences. And in the political section it
                    involved having somebody be my translator, who would translate the press for me
                    because I didn't know any Czech. I knew a little German, and my mother who was
                    with me knew some German, so we got along with that as best we could. But
                    literally we had no way of expecting what happened. Steinhardt was playing
                    bridge nightly with members of the National Socialist party, who were the
                    conservative party in Prague. And the only person I think in the embassy who had
                    any contact with, I'll say the labor union, was our labor attach�. And would
                    have been the only one who sensed that something was going to happen.</p>
                <p>And when it did take place, it was done so skillfully, so smoothly, without very
                    much eruption of any kind. There was a little shooting around the castle area
                    when there was a student protest. There were armed bands of workers - they had
                    colored or black bands on their arm, they weren't themselves armebut were
                    marching down the center of town. The Czechs themselves weren't prepared for
                    anything like this. They thought this was a passing phenomenon. They said, “our
                    people are not thugs. Our people are not vandals. This will all shake out.” And
                    of course what happened was, because it was done so smoothly and gradually, a
                    lot of Czechs were taken in and instead of making the obvious move, which was to
                    get their money outside, sell off their country places as fast as they could,
                    move anything else outsidand they could still have done that for the first
                    several monthget their exit visas and so forth, they didn't do it. And they
                    stayed on, like my immediate neighbor, who was a splendid man, a fine lawyer.
                    His family stayed on, and he was sent to a labor camp. She was obliged to share
                    their apartment with another family and do housework and so forth. It was a very
                    bitter period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a bit about what life, what you were doing,
                        how you operated before this coup in '48? I mean, when you arrived there,
                        early '48 </hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: January 10.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:was the Soviet Union considered a menace or a problem? What
                        was your impression of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well, I don't think any of us felt nervous about our own immediate
                    situation until the Berlin Airlift. Then we could see the possibility of that
                    blowing up, and then we'd be out of there. But as far as the Czech coup is
                    concerned, it was fairly deplorable. We hated every minute of it. We did our
                    best to keep out of trouble. It was very easy for us to blunder in that way. We
                    could embarrass ourselves; we could also embarrass our Czech friends. One had,
                    even as arrived as late in the game as I, you'd have met some Czechs, who spoke
                    English, and who circulated in the social life of the town with the social and
                    diplomatic community. Then you found yourself in the position of wanting to do
                    favors for them and be helpful.</p>
                <p>And we'd be repeatedly warned by Steinhardt that we were not to do things like
                    take valuables out of the country or take possessions out of the country or take
                    people out of the country. And we knew all the time that he was doing that very
                    thing. In fact, Mrs. Steinhardt was in it with him up to the elbows. And if you
                    went to a dinner at the ambassador's residence and the ladies left and went into
                    the petit salon with Mrs. Steinhardt, I was never sorry because she knew as much
                    as he did about what was going on.</p>
                <p>At any rate, one found oneself in the situation of trying to be helpful, trying
                    to keep out of trouble and in the end, I was declared persona non grata and
                    apparently it was because Walter Berge, who was senior to me in the political
                    section, wanted to pass on some contacts to me when he left. One or two of them
                    were very fine young Czechs who had served in the air force out of England
                    during the war, and they had formed their own little resistance movement. I had
                    no idea how it operated, and I did not really want to. But they wanted to be in
                    touch with me, and under those circumstances I thought it was their
                    responsibility if things went wrong. May I pour you coffee or tea?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little tea would be fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: What do you like in your tea?</p>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: So I did meet with some of these people, but not often. And now and
                    then I would meet with somebody, for a walk and he would ask me if I would take
                    a letter for them. And once he asked me if I would take a suitcase out, and it
                    wasn't for him, [it was for] somebody he knew he felt indebted to. And apart
                    from that, I knew a couple very well </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you take suitcases and letters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes. Always a little concerned, of course, with crossing the border.
                    Because we would be stopped. The diplomatic passport was usually satisfactory,
                    but you could never be positive that they wouldn't want to search you. But I and
                    most of the Americans, the ones who didn't I hadn't very much respect for, cause
                    I figured they weren't doing it out of conviction, they were just doing it
                    because they were nervous Nellie's. Because if you could help somebody you
                    helped somebody. I did wind up in the Czech archives, and I was declared persona
                    non grata. And I'm not quite sure how this came about.</p>
                <p>But fortunately I was already out. I had my travel orders to go to Palermo. Most
                    of our third secretaries went to Italian posts. And I watched the good ones
                    being picked off and my tour was Palermo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, my Claiborne pal went to Genoa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. I think the same personnel bureau was handling both
                    countries. At any rate, I stopped in Florence to see if I could get some petrol
                    coupons. Petrol was still scarce. He greeted me with the Herald Tribune with my
                    picture on the front page. That was the reason the professor from Boston got in
                    touch with me, because he found me. He said that by and large there was nothing
                    in there that suggested that I was anywhere as guilty as I had been made out to
                    be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they claiming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: They were claiming that I had been working with the Czech Underground
                    and named Czechs who were later imprisoned and executed in some cases. In other
                    words, I should have blood on my hands, but in fact I'm exonerated by what's in
                    the archives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back to Czechoslovakia. Once the coup had
                        taken place and the Communist regime had taken over, did you find you were
                        in really hostile territory at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Very much so. My mother would be followed every step of the way when
                    she left the apartment. We had an apartment downtown. She and friend of hers who
                    drove, they would often go out together, just to a market let's say, and they
                    would walk and look at antique shops and things like that. They were always
                    followed. It gave them a great charge. They would turn around and wink at the
                    guys and so forth. In my case, I was never conscious of being followed. I would
                    take the car to drive to the embassy, and I would have it there all day. I would
                    go out in the evening, and I wasn't conscious of being followed then. But
                    evidently I was more observed than I realized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find your work, as a political officer, terribly
                        curtailed at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Our political reporting, of course, was based on the local press and
                    whatever gossip we could glean. I wasn't privy to as much high level gossip as
                    other people would have been, for example people who were talking to the Czech
                    foreign minister and so forth. I did meet Masaryk briefly right after I arrived,
                    and I was of course among those who stood on the street corner and wept when his
                    bier went by. It was a real shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was apparently killed, pushed out a window.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No question in the Czechs' mind that it was a murder assassination.
                    Defenestration. This professor from Boston has looked in the archives with
                    respect to Masaryk of course and he tells a story about three men who would have
                    been eyewitnesses to what happened. That one of them is dead and one of them,
                    two of them are dead and one of them is living in a situation where he's had a
                    stroke and he can't talk. At any rate, what he could glean was that they had
                    forced their way into his apartment in the foreign office after he'd gone to
                    bed. He had tried to escape by going into the bathroom and climbing out on a
                    fairly substantial ledge outside the bathroom. If he was pushed, he may well
                    have been pushed. If he wasn't, he obviously fell.</p>
                <p>What was unpleasant was, for example, a senior member of the foreign ministry,
                    that is senior to me, who was in charge of the American desk approached me and
                    asked me if I would keep his family silver in my apartment. Of course I said I
                    would and I kept it under my bed. I didn't think anybody was going to break in
                    and look. He was just afraid that they were going to come and collect things
                    like that from his house. And I don't know what happened to him. I have never
                    known. But he did reclaim it before I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why [were] the Czechs so nasty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Good question. I've never really put that to myself as to why it took
                    them, why they were so hardnosed with their form of communism for so long. All I
                    can tell you is the communist penetration of Czechoslovakia was done in a very
                    gradual and disarming fashion. And then after that, things tightened up and
                    people were thrown in prison or sent to labor camps. They totally wiped out the
                    professional class and the middle class. They didn't need any lawyers any more.
                    The doctors who practiced in hospitals were, by that time, working under
                    conditions which were dominated by whoever was the Czech communist in charge.
                    All the government offices were taken over with a communist at the head of it.
                    Everybody had to watch his step. Everybody had to swear allegiance to a
                    communist [unknown word]. Children were supposedly brainwashed in schools. Their
                    parents would worry about this, wonder about sort of children they were bringing
                    up since they were being so heavily indoctrinated. I asked my Czech professor
                    friend about this because he would have been of the age, he was of the age of
                    these children and he said not to worry, it didn't take.</p>
                <p>Q: It didn't seem to take anywhere. When you left you were assigned to Palermo
                    and you went there in what, was it '49 by that time?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, it was October '49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in Palermo from when to when?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I was a vice consul handling visas. They had a big office handling
                    citizenship because of the fact that there had been this holy year during which
                    Americans had come over in great droves, had been persuaded by their cousins or
                    sisters and their aunts to vote against the communists in the elections.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: We were pushing that in every way we could to prevent the communists
                    from winning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lots of money went in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: A friend of mine was busy handing it out, a fellow named Mark [unknown
                    name] who was with the CIA. But these American innocents would come over and
                    they would try to vote, and then they would lose their citizenship by those
                    rules. The same rules don't apply anymore. So the citizenship office was very
                    busy, and of course everybody wanted to get out of Palermo. It was still
                    impoverished from the war. The opportunities were nil. Those who did get out
                    were usually the ones who went to Milan, where there was more opportunities just
                    generally. But the others would want to get out because they had a distant
                    relative in the United States, and they thought this was the answer. [There
                    were] a lot of pitiful cases. So what could you do? You got trained to say
                    no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just saying no, no, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. As nicely as you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about the mafia in the United States and
                        its ties to Sicily at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I understand that Lucky Luciano was in Palermo while I was there. I
                    was told he showed up at bars, particular bars. Only later, from looking at
                    television, did I learn how the mafia had gotten their grip on things in
                    Palermo. It was thanks to the American army, which had come in and figured out
                    the best way to accomplish its own purposes was to establish these characters in
                    key situations, and they took over. But what we had in my day was not a mafia
                    situation, but a kind of crazy Robin Hood situation. There was a man who was
                    said to have robbed the rich to feed the poor. I'm groping for his name right
                    now. Kidnapping was a favorite activity. It still is in Chechnya I get.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: So that was going on, and if you took a drive upcountry, let's say,
                    not very far out of town, you would get into an area where people lived - and
                    this is so European, so different from the United States - if you worked a farm
                    in the United States, you lived on the farm. If you worked on a farm in Europe,
                    you lived in the village and went off to the fields every day and came back at
                    the end of the day. So you'd see these peasants going along with their donkey
                    carts, going to or from the fields, and they always had a gun across their laps.
                    They had a dog in the back and a gun across the knees. They were afraid of the
                    very kind of marauding that was going on by this Robin Hood type. Wasn't the
                    mafia that they were worried about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting pressure from New York congressmen and

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: On visa cases, yes. I'd get a call in the middle of the night, and I'd
                    think, “Oh, my God, what's happened to my brother or my sister?” And it'd be
                    some congressman. And one in particular, I think Rooney, maybe one of the more
                    objectionable </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Rooney of Brooklyn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: He wasn't of Italian background, but I guess he had a lot of Italians
                    in his voting district.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Very much so. At the end, I was due a home leave at the end of six or
                    seven months, and I was determined not to come back. It was a very disagreeable
                    climate in the consulate itself. We had a consul general who very few people
                    could get along with except the one woman consul who was his spy. And the consul
                    general's wife was very autocratic. And because her mother was very big in
                    California politics, she and both her mother, who was there much of the time,
                    they would throw their weight around. They treated the staff as if they were
                    peons. It was really quite a shock. We didn't expect to find that in the foreign
                    service. But the story was, I'm told, that he was an old China hand, and some of
                    them I think were accustomed to situations where they were all powerful. And he
                    wasn't as bad as his wife; she was very difficult.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was it?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: His name was David Berger. And he retired after that post. And I liked
                    to think I helped it along. At any rate, the one thing she, the wife was very,
                    well this is just gossip </p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it gives a flavor for the period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: She seemed to be resentful of the fact that somebody had served at an
                    embassy. And there were two of us who'd come from embassies, one from Hungary
                    and then the other, I, and my mother. And I think she was particularly
                    unpleasant with respect to us. And when you get to a post, of course, you have a
                    month or six weeks, I don't know how much it is today, where you can live in a
                    hotel, until you've found something suitable. But your expenses are covered for
                    you. And so we decided we'd live in a hotel that was probably the nicest one
                    there and had a lovely view of the bay. Although we couldn't afford the food
                    prices there, so we managed cooking some meals in our hotel room on a little
                    electric hot plate. But Mrs. Berger couldn't stand this, and neither could her
                    husband. They tried to get me out of there so fast. And they offered me all
                    kinds of opportunities, and they were crummy. You lived in neighborhoods where
                    everybody hung their clothes out on the line. And I said to my mother that I
                    didn't join the foreign service to live in a slum. And eventually a situation
                    opened up [in] a part of a compound that had a major house, that belonged to a
                    principessa, which we rented as a government and where the consul general lived.
                    There were a number of ancillary buildings and in one case it was a stable, and
                    that had been renovated and made more or less habitable. So my mother and I
                    moved into this stable. And it looked quite charming except that in the winter,
                    there wasn't the kind of, the building was built in such a way that it would be
                    cool in summer. So in winter it would be just damp and you could write your name
                    on the walls of your bedroom in the mold. But we were surrounded by lemon
                    groves; that part of it was pleasant.</p>
                <p>But Palermo was a place where all you could do, your work was dull, but you could
                    get in the car on the weekend with your bread and your cheese and wine and see
                    beautiful things and interesting places. A lot of old Greek ruins are there,
                    which you probably know and some which are not on the tourist beat. There are
                    small minor amphitheaters, which most people don't even know about, which we'd
                    be shown by our Sicilian friends. That was the way we made it habitable for us,
                    so to speak, or passed the time. Plus in the winter there was the opera
                    season.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right. I had some one who frowned on me for making a complaint.
                    And eventually I was offered a post at Basel, which would have been interesting,
                    just to relieve the man who was due home leave and his replacement I don't think
                    was in mind, they just needed a temporary person there. And I was all set to go
                    to Basel when the guy decided he wouldn't take home leave. And eventually I was
                    offered Montreal and I took it happily.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is March 6, 2000. Louise you said you wanted to talk a little more about
                    India, your time there. And if you have anything you'd like to add or expand on,
                    please go ahead.</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I was having a look at the map to remind myself of what was the Madras
                    responsibility. And you go up here to Andhra Pradesh, which includes Hyderabad,
                    and there is Madras and here is a large piece of Mysore and Kerala down there
                    and Travancore and Cochin comprises Kerala all the way down there. So it is
                    quite an expanse. So when you asked me what I did officially, it sounded kind of
                    thin. I said, I mentioned I did a lot of consular work and a lot of invoices and
                    so forth. I also did the coding and decoding. For the most part we used the old
                    Brown code because we didn't have a great deal that required much secrecy. But
                    when we used the coding machine, I tell you, you lost every fingernail you
                    owned, it was a real devil. At any rate, apart from such functions, I was in a
                    sense the American presence in south India. I had a wonderful consul but he
                    wasn't well and didn't particularly like traveling. He maintained his office
                    work with great diligence and skill. And he maintained his alliances and
                    friendships with all the right people in Madras and among the missionaries, but
                    there were no official excursions unless I did them. And I was only too happy
                    to. So as I say, I was the American presence if you want to call it that. But
                    mostly I was just a girl looking for adventure and curious, a lot of curiosity.
                    It led to some very interesting experiences. Also among my duties was to dispose
                    of the classified material periodically by taking it up to the rooftop of the
                    building and burning it in a kind of a trash can in the middle of the tropical
                    heat. Much of the clerical work was done by our clerical staff. We had a
                    splendid Indian Christian who was number one clerk. He was accustomed to going
                    down to the port and clearing shipments and things of that nature and was kind
                    of chief boss of the rest of the clerical staff. It was my consul's judgment
                    that we should not hire a Brahmin because the entire British community were
                    depending upon Brahmins for their clerical and intellectual skills. But it was
                    as if you were caught in the toils of a community. Whatever official personal
                    secrets you might have went straight through the community. So he made a very
                    distinct point of no Brahmins. So we had a mixed group of Hindus and Indian
                    Christians. So then he scored a point, which he was determined on doing, he
                    managed to hire a female clerk. It was a great innovation. She was a very nice
                    personable, diligent young woman.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>One of the things about south India was that there were three languageTamil,
                    Feligu and Malayalam. And I once had aspirations to study at least one. I tried,
                    and it didn't seem to me that I was going to get very far. It was so unrelated
                    to any European language that it just came out sounding [like nonsense]. But the
                    young Indian Civil Service officers, British who managed to learn Tamil would
                    get a stipend for their efforts. Among other things, sort of showing the flag, I
                    would visit and speak at Indian colleges [and] hospitals. We had a very major
                    hospital, which was a missionary hospital in Valore. And I guess I saw my first
                    cadavers there. Thanks to missionaries and Indian friends I probably saw about
                    as much of India as you possibly could see. I had a young friend, an Indian
                    friend, who was a journalist and was working for the English language newspaper,
                    the Madras Mail, and he had a certain amount of native pride in showing me about
                    because he wanted me to see part of India and meet those people. So through him
                    I was able to make quite a few interesting contacts and always found these
                    senior Indian gurus, politicians or whatever they were very approachable. As I
                    said to you I never felt physically uncomfortable in south India. Now there were
                    times you'd be in a real jam. In one instance I was driving some distance from
                    Madras in the Cochin area and the most dreaded thing that can happen to you
                    happened. You pick up a bullock shoe. A bullock shoe is a thin round band of
                    steel, like a woman's bracelet almost, razor sharp and bullocks were always
                    dropping these shoes. And an automobile tire would be ripped apart. And tires
                    weren't all that available; it was wartime. Neither was gasoline. You always
                    traveled with a couple of tins of petrol. But in this instance we were in a very
                    thinly populated, if you would believe there was any thinly populated area, but
                    we were in between villages and sure enough we had a flat tire. We had one
                    spare, and we couldn't afford to take a chance on another bullock shoe. So when
                    we got into the nearest village, we found what they called a petrol station, but
                    they had no tires to sell. They could order one but it would take a day or two.
                    And the next question was where to stay. And there seemed to be no hotel or
                    such. It so happened that somebody directed me to the local priest. And he was a
                    bushy bearded Indian chap who was in his 70s or 80s I guess, very welcoming. And
                    lo and behold he offered us, me and the driver, a place to stay for the night.
                    So if there was ever a Christian it was he. Otherwise I was hopelessly stranded
                    and would have had to sleep in the car.</p>
                <p>One of the things I observed in India was that there was no tradition of
                    philanthropy there. I found only one instance of it, a so called Ramakrishna
                    mission. And I met a charming young Hindu who was serving in this mission. Its
                    real function, essential function, was to provide orphanages for young boys. And
                    I was really impressed with him as a person, if you want to say a man had a
                    Christ like demeanor, he did. But honestly apart from that and what the American
                    missionaries were doing and the YMCA and the YWCA, there was no organized
                    philanthropy of any kind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alms.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Alms, but no consistent giving. And there would be holy men who lived
                    totally off alms. And they'd wander around from household to household, in the
                    woods eating nuts and berries and then going into a community. [They'd] become
                    what you might call the local holy man to a particular family. One of these was
                    an enchanting man that I met. He maintained or at least the family that offered
                    him hospitality- [end of tape]</p>
                <p>This holy man, a man who must've been in his 50s, wore the saffron robe and as
                    far as I could see he had no visible means of support except for what was
                    offered him, he was made particularly welcome in this home of what I would say
                    would be affluent, middle class Indians. And they looked upon his presence there
                    as a blessing upon the household and also they turned to him for advice. And
                    whether his advice was worth anything I've no idea. But he always had a radiant
                    smile about him that gave you, and I'm sure them, a sense of peace. And broadly
                    speaking a sense of happiness and well being. I was told about him. He didn't
                    speak English so I had to use my friend as translator, interpreter, that he did
                    amazing things such as burying himself underground for weeks at a time or
                    sinking underneath water for days and surviving, all of which sounds terribly
                    unbelievable but it was certainly taken as faith by those who were acquainted
                    with him.</p>
                <p>This leads me to the fact that I visited three ashrams while I was in south
                    India. The most significant one was named for Sri Oribindo who had written in
                    English and published his philosophical works widely. And they happened to have
                    been read by Margaret Wilson, the president's daughter when she was at
                    University of Chicago, and she was sufficiently impressed that she wanted to
                    visit and spend some time in his ashram. She did so and was overtaken by some
                    kind of an illness, and she's buried in Pondicherry, where the ashram is
                    located, in the cemetery there. Pondicherry in those days was still a French
                    possession, a little enclave along the sea, out of Madras. I mean cut out of
                    Madras presidency itself, quite a charming small city.</p>
                <p>The ashram was the main industry there. Interestingly enough it reminded me of a
                    retirement community. Because people who had wanted to come and study the
                    teachings of Sri Oribindo would frequently come with their families. They would
                    give up whatever means they had, whatever estate they had, turn it over to the
                    community and participate in the community's activities, which were all in
                    support of the community itself. For example each individual had his own tasks
                    and responsibilities. They did their own cooking, baking, washing up, cleaning
                    and there must have been other tasks that they had to do. They had a shoe
                    cobbler establishment and I think a spinning establishment. Everybody was
                    happily busy and at the same time had time for prayers and study. Then there
                    would be a kind of an evensong.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>By the time I visited Pondicherry and the Sri Oribindo ashram, he had died. But a
                    Frenchwoman who had been his disciple became the leader and I've been groping in
                    my memory for her title, but it won't come. And she was no young woman herself.
                    But I understood that she still conducted some discussions and classes. But the
                    principal thing she did was to give holy sight of herself every early evening.
                    She would come out in sort of a gauzy white, and she would stand framed by a
                    full moon behind and she would extend her arms out to the community who would
                    all be gathered in the gardens nearby, and be in this position of namaskaram,
                    appreciating holy sight of her.</p>
                <p>This was perhaps the most westernized of the communities because English was
                    reasonably widely spoken. People came there from Calcutta and all over India. It
                    wasn't local in the sense that some of the other ashrams I visited were. And the
                    fact that they were willing to give up everything they owned and stay there, I
                    thought was quite remarkable. The guesthouse, which is interesting I think, was
                    designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It was a very simple structure made of native
                    wood, and it was open air as much as possible, but you could shutter yourself
                    for your own privacy and your own room. The bed was simply a cot with a rope
                    mattress, a rope whatever you call ibox sprinand it had a mattress on top. [It
                    was] the minimum, but very satisfactory.</p>
                <p>And I visited two other ashrams in turn. One had a particularly famous teacher
                    guru. I would of course have no idea what he had to say because it was always in
                    his own language. But the young men who would be grouped around him at the
                    appointed time, let's say he would begin the session at ten o'clock in the
                    morning, the young men grouped around him were greatly in awe of his presence.
                    He would discourse for a while- [end of tape]</p>
                <p>Q: They were gathered around him.</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: They were in awe of the master. And they would listen to his discourse
                    and he would stop and ask if there were any questions. And one point one of the
                    - this all had to be translated for me by my friend who took me therone of the
                    questions was did the guru not feel that he was being, what would the word be,
                    at any rate, didn't he disapprove of the fact that here was this young white
                    woman who was not sitting with her knees curled up in front of her in the
                    traditional Indian fashion and wasn't this a slight of his dignity? And he
                    cheerfully responded that she wasn't used to sitting that way and in this
                    instance it was perfectly alright.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The other ashram - which again was quite different each of these different from
                    the other - was a very high caste Brahmin ashram. And I'm astonished to this day
                    as to how I even got in there. But I was taken in there by a friend. And they
                    had, I don't remember that I spent the night there, but they had modest
                    accommodations for outsiders. But of course in the sense of being high caste
                    Brahmins, all the food was prepared, which was like kosher cooking of the
                    orthodox type, prepared by Brahmin people in the kitchen and then served to the
                    Brahmin elite who would sit around cross legged in this dining pavilion (you
                    might call it a refectory but it was open air) and the food served on a palm
                    leaf, all vegetarian and rice. I have to tell you it was the most exquisite food
                    I had ever had in all of India. [It was] cooked with coconut oil, which is much
                    lighter when you eat it, probably worse for you. But I never had better food. If
                    I could go back there for more I would.</p>
                <p>Another Indian experience was to go into the Mysore jungle. I became acquainted
                    with a young man whose home was Mysore, and he and his brother invited me to go
                    on a visit to the jungle, a safari. And I thought this would be a nice
                    opportunity to invite one of the nice American woman missionaries I knew,
                    unmarried. We all went off together in our several cars and arrived at a forest
                    bungalow as they called it in the jungle, which meant it was a place the forest
                    officer would stay as he was making his rounds. And this was a perfectly
                    adequate place right in the heart of the jungle. I took my own cook with me,
                    which was suggested. The two young men, the Mysore fellows, had their own cook
                    too. Their brother, incidentally, was a general in the Indian army, when I say
                    Indian I don't mean Indian National Army but the British Indian Army. It was
                    quite a distinguished Mysore family.</p>
                <p>Well the safari would begin each day, and this was probably for about three days,
                    four at the most, by getting up at five o'clock in the morning and setting off,
                    usually by elephant. And I found riding an elephant it's like being on board
                    ship, you're always bracing yourself. And you weren't always very happy with the
                    thought that the elephant would stop and eat whenever it felt like it. Then it
                    would run and catch up with the rest of the elephants. But it was an experience.
                    At any rate, we would just be in the forest about five o'clock to hear the
                    forest come alive. You could hear the birds and the other animal sounds and stay
                    with roaming through the forest for about two hours at which point it would be
                    getting too hot. You were always on the alert for tigers. There were tigers
                    there. And so after ten o'clock, we would go back to the bungalow and we'd have
                    a fairly substantial meal, Indian meal. Chapatis and all the rest and have a
                    siesta. And then the end of the afternoon after the sun had gone down, we'd go
                    out again, but this time in a jeep, which the boys had. And we'd drive the track
                    through the jungle, which the forest officer used. And it was astonishing how
                    many animal eyes you could see as you looked around, picked up by the lights of
                    the jeep. And of course they would be attracted by the lights of the jeep. We
                    never actually encountered a tiger, I'm happy to say. But every now and then
                    they'd be indications that he'd been there. But one of my happiest memories is
                    that visit to the Mysore jungle. And I always say to myself if I ever went back
                    to India, it would be in winter and I'd do a safari. South India, I wouldn't
                    know about the North.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>[I have] two more small anecdotes or points. After I visited this third ashram,
                    which was so high caste Hindu, I was taken by an Indian friend to visit a
                    community which really consisted of one or two families, extended families. And
                    there were known as Nambudri Brahmins. And the curious thing about them was
                    their women observed purdah. Now how that cross fertilization came about,
                    between the Hindus and the Muslims, I don't know. But it must have had something
                    to do with the Muslim invasion of North India. Because when I arrived at this
                    village and I was met by my friend's friend and another man or two, and I sat
                    and visited with them - just a pleasant social visit - there was a little girl
                    of about ten who was hanging on to one of the men, a daughter I think. And she
                    couldn't stop staring at me. And I realized later that she wasn't used to seeing
                    a woman of any kind out and about with any of the male members of her
                    family.</p>
                <p>The women themselves lived in their own quarters from the great grandmother on
                    down. The matriarch was sufficiently elderly. I wouldn't begin to guess her age,
                    but she was a magnificent personality who received me in a loincloth. And where
                    she would normally have had earrings, the tendency is to each time put a larger
                    round circular ring in the ear so that it stretches the earlobe, and her
                    earlobes were simply empty loops. You visit this gray haired lady with empty
                    loops in her ears and her loincloth and you really are impressed. She then
                    introduced me to other members of the female household. They lived in a house
                    that was so constructed of stone that it was very cool, the coolest place I'd
                    been in on the whole trip. And she couldn't have been warmer. She was, her
                    interpreter was a grandson who was one of the men I'd been visiting outside, and
                    I was introduced to some of the other wives, daughters, whatever they were, who
                    were mature. And we talked about god knows what and she asked me if I had any
                    children. And I said no, I wasn't married. And at the end of our conversation as
                    I was leaving, she said I must come back and bring my children with me.</p>
                <p>I had always heard about Kerala, Cochin in particular, that it was the one part
                    of South India where women were often bare breasted. And sure enough as I was
                    driving through the countryside, it was more likely the peasant women that I
                    would meet than a more elevated social status. These were not Nambudri Brahmin,
                    these were just ordinary lower caste women I suppose. But part of this business
                    about being naked above the waist apparently has its origins in the fact that
                    it's a matriarchal society there, which means the land is all in the maternal
                    side. And oddly enough, whether it's because of that maternal, matriarchal
                    establishment or not I don't know, but that part of South India provided some of
                    the best brains in the Indian Civil Service up north. They didn't need to stay
                    home and watch the paddy fields, as their wives were able to stay home and go
                    about such responsibilities, the responsibilities of the estate. So they could
                    do something else and there was nothing else very challenging. Some of the best
                    know upper bureaucratic names are people who came from families there.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>One other thing that occurred to me was the fact that you had these two hill
                    stations in south India. One, Budukaman, was the British hill station, it was
                    official. The other was the American missionary hill station, Kodicanal. I think
                    I mentioned that earlier. I remember that when I was in Madras there was still
                    discussion of the episode in which the Japanese navy, which was sailing in the
                    Bay of Bengal and had stopped at Colombo, had then cruised up along the coast as
                    far as Madras, fired a few salvos at the city of Madras and then went back its
                    way it had come. Nobody knows to this day what was in the Japanese's mind. I did
                    see a television program relating to this not long ago, but they miscalculated
                    severely because if they had landed, there would have been no defenses. This was
                    about 1942 I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Early 1942. The Japanese navy came, they went all the way
                        over to Madagascar, and they cruised there. But there was no follow through
                        plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No follow through. They could have had India, at least the south of
                    it. And with the government up six, seven thousand feet up in the hill station
                    and no military establishment of any consequence, it was wide open.</p>
                <p>I go back to Prague now, and I don't remember what I said before. But I can tell
                    you the only time I was ever frightened was soon after I arrived with my mother.
                    I didn't know a word of Czech. This was in the days before they would prepare
                    you for a foreign post with language studies. This was January '48. And I
                    arrived on Woodrow Wilson Avenue, at Woodrow Wilson station. And if there hadn't
                    been somebody from the admin section of the embassy to meet me, I would have had
                    to stumble along on my own, with getting my own cabs. But fortunately he was
                    there. And we stayed at a hotel initially, my mother and I, and one night, there
                    being a movie theater not far away, we thought we'd go to see what was showing.
                    It turned out to be a very ugly anti American piece of communist propaganda
                    produced in Poland. And the Americans were depicted so viciously, as being so
                    villainous and so debauched, that the two of us in a full theater were sitting,
                    cringing, slumped down in our seats, hoping nobody would notice. [We were]
                    thinking to ourselves if there should suddenly be a fire alarm or something
                    dramatic and everybody would be rushing out, we wouldn't dare open our mouths to
                    declare who we were.</p>
                <p>I may be repeating myself, but the main thing was to find a place to live. This
                    is always true when you're starting a foreign service post. There aren't
                    government quarters. We first had the Alcron Hotel, then we moved in with three
                    American girls from the embassy. And then we tried to buy a house in the suburbs
                    and found it was just impossible. It didn't work; my mother was too isolated. It
                    was hard to heat. And the only thing remarkable about the house, it looked
                    attractive, was that they had stored, people who were renting the house had
                    stored three great canisters of goose fat. Goose fat was their treasure. Why
                    they left it behind I'll never know, but they couldn't take it with them. After
                    a week of this, we decided no go and we were lucky enough to stumble on the
                    apartment, which we eventually used, which I think I talked about earlier.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>And then there was the issue of socializing. Initially, we having arrived just
                    before the coup, there was a social community of Czechs and westerners, that you
                    could easily move into. It was very agreeable. But gradually one became more
                    concerned about mingling with Czechs. There was one young woman who approached
                    me cheerfully because she had known GIs [American soldiers]. Her English was
                    very fluent but also very GI English. And she was easy, outgoing and bright. She
                    was a Jewish woman named Eva Donodova. And Eva had a circle of friends my age so
                    that every now and then I joined up with them for a pleasant evening. But Eva
                    had been imprisoned by the Nazis because she was Jewish. And she thought it was
                    time she got out of Czechoslovakia because she didn't know how things would go
                    under the communist regime for her. She borrowed a little money from me; it
                    didn't amount to much, it was really a gift. And she got caught going over the
                    border, she and her companions because it was at the time you couldn't exit
                    Czechoslovakia anymore. So she disappeared off the radar screen for a while,
                    then lo and behold she was back in Prague. And she got in touch with me, and she
                    said to me quite open and honestly, “They let me back because I knew you and
                    they want me to report on you.” So you know she was pleasant to be with and fun
                    and there was no reason to cut her off. She was honest with me, and I knew where
                    I stood. But that was one of the curiosities of living there at the time.</p>
                <p>I guess I also mentioned the fact that my translator interpreter later explained
                    to the embassy that he was obliged to report on me. Something, on a weekly
                    basis. And if he didn't know anything, he made it up.</p>
                <p>I think I mentioned last time that things got more and more uncomfortable when we
                    realized that the concierge of the apartment building that I lived in was an
                    informer. And she was a very unpleasant, made life unpleasant for me and anybody
                    that I employed, but there was nothing I could do about it. At the same time
                    that we were going through this period of social isolation, the embassies, the
                    foreign embassies drummed up their own sociability. They, among other things,
                    the Americans had an opportunity which was unique, through the foreign office we
                    were able to use a villa of some two hours drive outside of Prague, set in the
                    hills, which would accommodate skiing and other outdoor activity. And that was a
                    great salvation particularly, I think, for the clerks. But we all enjoyed it.
                    Eventually after I left I understand that the government took this back again.
                    They had already appropriated the property from the owner who was a shoe
                    manufacturer. But then they decided I guess that the Americans didn't deserve
                    this anymore, so they took it back.</p>
                <p>But on one occasion while we were visiting there, usually it would be on a
                    weekend, I found three little boys huddled in a rabbit hutch. A rabbit hutch
                    looks rather like you see in kennels for cats. And they had a kind of a tiered,
                    tiers and mesh wire in the front. And these children had heard that the police
                    were looking for them and here they were hiding in a rabbit hutch, which tells
                    you what life was like in the country at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I'm not sure if I mentioned going to Krakow. I had an opportunity in, perhaps it
                    was May of 1948, to fly in the air attach�'s plane to Krakow, no to Warsaw. I
                    was fortunate enough to stay with friends in Warsaw. One of the women in the
                    embassy who was of Polish extraction, American, suggested to me that we could
                    make a trip to Krakow by bus, by plane and bus. She would enjoy it, and I said I
                    was delighted with the thought. So we flew to Krakow and landed in a pasture.
                    I'm pretty sure I talked about this before. The pasture was the airport. As we
                    were about to leave, the police detained us. She had taken a photograph as we
                    came into landing. And we were obliged to go to the police station and just sit
                    there and study our shoes. We didn't know what was going to happen. They took
                    her film away from her, which of course was a big disappointment. She explained
                    that we had diplomatic privileges and so forth and they should call the embassy.
                    They took their own sweet time. Eventually we were released and allowed to go
                    our own way. So we did our Krakow sightseeing, but we didn't have as much time
                    left as we wanted. Then we got on a bus to Auschwitz, and that's one reason I've
                    never felt it necessary to go to the Holocaust Museum here. They had so recently
                    opened Auschwitz as a museum that if you walked past bin after bin, first there
                    would be a bin of what you would call crutches and other things of that sort,
                    artificial limbs. Then there was a bin of teeth that had been taken from people
                    with gold and melted down. Then you came to a bin of shoes. And the human oil in
                    the shoes was such that the flies were buzzing on it. As I say I don't think I
                    need to go to the Holocaust Museum. But enough of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to Montreal and you were in Montreal
                        from 1950 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: '53.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I was vice consul and economic commercial officer. And mainly they
                    needed someone in that slot who would respond to the many required reports
                    expected from the department of agriculture, the department of commerce, mines
                    and mineralogwhat do we call that department if it is a department?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Department of the interior.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Department of the interior. And so I became acquainted with people in
                    the pulp and paper industry. For example, the headquarters of the association is
                    in Montreal. And I became friendly with people in the mining industry, a number
                    of whom were Americans, and would invite me up to visit their mines and their
                    exploration camps. And then the textile industry, I think, had its headquarters
                    in Montreal and that was another one that there was required reporting on. And
                    one time I had an assignment of investigating the market for small appliances in
                    Montreal. It doesn't sound like very much but by the time it was done my boss
                    said to me, “I didn't think a woman could do something like that,” which I
                    thought was ridiculous because women are more after small appliances than men
                    are as a rule. I mean irons, toasters, things like that, what was the market,
                    what was the potential market for American exports? I found out what they were
                    selling now, what they thought they'd be interested in selling.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was the consul general?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: A good question. I'll have to fill that one in later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can fill that one in later, no problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I've reached the stage where names don't spring to mind. We enjoyed
                    Montreal. As I mentioned I think, it was a segmented society, a divided society.
                    We meet almost nobody what they would call the French community. And the upper
                    class French community tended to keep to themselves anyway. Fortunately the
                    English community, the Anglo community, was very well established and very open
                    and easy. There was a garden club in which my mother had participated and made
                    many delightful friends, English friends, a lot of Anglo friends there, whom I
                    came to know as well. McGill University had a substantial number of American
                    medical professors in those days. They had begun to be imported, oh, some 10
                    years at least earlier. Most of the women I met would have been older than I, so
                    their husbands had been there some time teaching. And they couldn't have been
                    nicer. So we made some very pleasant friendships there, some of which translated
                    into meeting people in Ottawa whom they knew.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Eventually I was transferred to Ottawa, and I arrived on Coronation Day [for]
                    Queen Elizabeth II. You never saw a city looking more splendid, banners
                    everywhere, magnificent. It gave one a great lift. I was there on my own. My
                    mother had gone down to the States. I was going to have to find suitable housing
                    and so forth. But there was just a thrill to walk down this main thoroughfare,
                    near the Parliament buildings and see all the bunting, all the banners, parades.
                    You can imagine what it was like. Again the job was economic commercial and
                    again some of it overlapped with what I'd been doing in Montreal. We were able
                    to make friends readily because my mother joined a book club where we met some
                    very interesting people. There was the younger set, not so young some of them,
                    the governor general was crazy about barn dancing, so he set quite a pattern for
                    society with that. He loved skiing and barn dancing and his name will come to me
                    in due course. One could also go skiing very readily, half hour to the ski
                    slopes, which is about half what it took to go to the ski slopes from Montreal.
                    Wonderful lake country for swimming and canoeing. In fact, endless opportunities
                    to go on canoeing weekends in relatively unpopulated areas, as long as you were
                    with somebody who knew, who had his bearings and knew where we were going. You
                    could go off and camp, spend the night and then canoe some more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into something that I've heard people who
                        served in Canada at other times say - one problem about the Canadians is,
                        that when they hear you're American, particularly attached to the embassy or
                        consulate, it's “big you” and “poor little us” and “you have to understand
                        us” and that sort of thing, which meant you better keep your hand on your
                        wallet as far as negotiating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well there's a certain type of Canadian, yes, who's impossible. We
                    used to go to an annual summer conference at which these Anglo Canadian super
                    intellectuals would gather and it was always very “loftier than thou” when it
                    came to anything American. We were the uncultured barbarians. We got awfully
                    tired of that. The Globe and Mail was must reading, but it was so full of anti
                    Americanisms. It's par for the course. I don't think it will ever change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel within the French community about the
                        role of the Roman Catholic Church at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well I was there at a time before the big change, which is probably
                    why I met so few French Canadians, and those I met were lower class. They were
                    still very much under the influence of the church and the old style. It's only
                    in, well I can't say recent anymore because it's taken some time [for this] to
                    happen, but you go to Montreal now and, by george, they're even beginning to
                    feel so much at home that they don't mind speaking English. And they're on top
                    of things. As we all know, they've got a lot going industry wise, high tech
                    industry wise.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>One of the things when we lived in Ottawa that we did was visit outside of
                    Montreal and Quebec the asbestos mines, the asbestos industry. I think it was
                    General Dynamics was trying to make a purchase there. Or else get rid of
                    something they already held, I've forgotten. The curious thing was, the man who
                    showed us around one of the most significant mines and mills of asbestos, came
                    from a family that had worked in that area, with asbestos for three generations
                    and never had any problems with the lungs. People living in the village
                    somewhere else might, but he didn't. In the plant, in the mill, they all wore
                    masks. The mining itself seemed to be open pit mining. But I remember New
                    Jersey, Manville, New Jersey, they had terrific lawsuits. They weren't
                    necessarily the result of people working in the plant, but people living nearby.
                    So it's rather like tobacco I think. It could be that some people are more
                    sensitive than others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Canadian market? Were there various
                        obstacles put on trying to sell American products in Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: No, I never felt that way. Immediately after the free trade agreement
                    was signed, which was of course bitterly fought by some vested interests in
                    Canada, not by Canadians who were in senior official positions, who were all for
                    it. But there were lots of smaller manufacturers of things like furniture and so
                    forth who were suddenly making money hand over fist because they had the cheaper
                    Canadian dollar and easy access to raw materials that were used and were doing a
                    land office business here. So on the whole I think Canadians have no regrets
                    though there was an initial bitter, bitter internal dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well at the time though you were, this was '50 to '53
                        period </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That was too early for [it.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it hard to market American goods then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I don't remember that there were any serious impediments. Very often
                    people who were handling, let's say small appliances, had made long term
                    commitments with their suppliers so they were in no hurry to change. But there
                    was no, I never determined that there was any serious objection. If they could
                    make a connection they would. One thing, which has nothing to do really with
                    ordinary commerce, was that you couldn't buy any American wines and very little
                    American booze in the provincially controlled liquor stores. That's one thing
                    they absolutely shut us out cold. The American wine industry kept working at
                    this and working at this. I don't know how things are today, but very rarely did
                    we see any decent American wines.</p>

                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well Canadian and British whiskey were better than ours.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well I know we don't have bourbon. But the Canadian rye is first
                    class. Of course they could import British scotch quite readily and perhaps more
                    readily, with the trade agreements they had with Britain, than we could. It was
                    the wine that was the big hang-up.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy do much to try and open it up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Oh, yes, constantly. I think we've succeeded to a degree, although I
                    just don't know because I haven't visited recently. There was at the time, when
                    I was there with my husband, a group of commercial attach�s who would meet once
                    a month, each one being the host. It would at a hotel or a dining room of some
                    sort, a public dining room. And the entire menu would be representative of the
                    host country. And the wines that went with it would be representative. When it
                    came time for the Americans to do the entertaining, my husband looked around to
                    see what officer he could spare to send down over the border to Ogdensburg and
                    bring back American wine. He hit on this chap in the administrative office who
                    really wouldn't have known one kind of wine from another. And he came back with
                    Gallo red and Gallo white. Well we had to make the best of it. But afterwards
                    the French commercial attach� came up to Bill and he said, “These wines, you've
                    got us worried,” being sincere.</p>

                        Magazine and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Oh, yes, and afterwards when I was there later with my husband. It
                    began to be a more and more burning issue for them. And some of the civil
                    servants who ramrodded these restrictions through were among our best friends.
                    But it was a point of survival for them, an issue of survival. And of course
                    Readers Digest protested. Of course Time magazine protested. But honestly you
                    can see why they needed to do something like this. Of course they can't control
                    what comes in from Buffalo, over the radio and television. But their own
                    domestic material is so high class, I'd much rather listen to some of those
                    Canadian stations than our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what about, was the St. Lawrence Waterway in the

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That was coming about when I was with my husband in Ottawa, very much
                    so.</p>
                <p>Q: But that comes later on?</p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That comes later, after I was married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when did you get married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: May of '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we've still got quit a bit to cover before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well yes I guess we do. In the intervening period, I went back to
                    Washington and I worked?Well first of all I was invited to work with Eleanor
                    Dulles and I consulted with?.No, before that my transfer read that I was
                    supposed to go into the cultural affairs office, information and cultural
                    affairs. I just didn't think this was the way to move up in the foreign service,
                    so I consulted George Vest who'd been with me in Ottawa. So he said he'd look
                    around and see what there was, apart from this. Then the next thing that
                    happened was I was offered a position to work for Eleanor Dulles. And I asked
                    George what he thought and he said, “I wouldn't do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had an operation dealing with Berlin, with
                        Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: That's right and where could you go from there? And I wasn't, I didn't
                    have a German background. So I found a slot in INR [Intelligence and Research],
                    and I was working there for a while when my application for advanced economic
                    study was granted, and I went to Berkeley. So I spent the academic year, '56 57
                    at Berkeley. When I finished thaI'm sorry I'm getting ahead. Before that I went
                    to a tariff conference in 1956 in Geneva. That was out of INR. They needed each
                    particular- [end of tape]</p>
                <p>So that was a very happy occasion in the end because who would object to being in
                    Geneva for three months. The rate of exchange was tolerable, and the per diem
                    was quite tolerable. And the weather initially was balmy and then it turned
                    cold. But one could go skiing every weekend, only the man who was head of my
                    team was biting his nails for fear that I and another officer who would go
                    skiing would come back with a broken limb and that would put the kibosh on the
                    broken limb to some extent. But that never happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>And my particular group was negotiating with the Italians and the Austrians, and
                    we had a representative of the department of commerce on our team and also the
                    international tariff office guy. The representative from the tariff commission
                    knew what he was doing; the rest of us were sort of learning on the job. Bless
                    his heart when we discovered that the Austrians did not have any calculators,
                    that they were doing all these figures in their head to see what would be the
                    trade impact of lowering the tariffs on this or that item, he did it for them.
                    And they were a very nice group of people that we worked with. They were
                    relatively new because the government was just pulling itself together in those
                    days. And the Italians were very affable so everything went quite well I think.
                    Only we were looking forward to just another few days after Easter of enjoying
                    life in Geneva when the word came back that the bureau of conference affairs had
                    run out of money. Then we didn't have congressional opportunities to go and
                    finish assignments. Then we were just living hand to mouth with what the bureau
                    of international conferences could afford. So it was get out of there, ready or
                    not! Fortunately my work was finished, but there were some people who were very
                    embarrassed by this; they had to do things at the last minute that they had no
                    intention of trying to do in a hurry.</p>
                <p>Back home, I guess that's when I went to Berkeley, not immediately but some time
                    soon after. Then I came back to trade agreements, and after a period in trade
                    agreements, which was in the old munitions building, there was an opening which
                    somebody mentioned to me, which was in the Bureau of United Kingdom and Canadian
                    Affairs as economic officer. I jumped at that opportunity and spent most of my
                    time actually on work dealing with Canada.</p>
                <p>In the course of that I'd already met Willis Armstrong, but it so happened that
                    since he was economic counselor in Ottawa and we had regular meetings of
                    Americans and Canadians and some cabinet level commission, that he would have to
                    call the desk and the desk would be me. And I wouldn't be on the phone very
                    long, but I would be setting things up with other people that needed to talk to
                    him. When the telephone bills were totted up at the embassy in Ottawa, the woman
                    working in the office responsible said, “An hour and a half, Mr. Armstrong to
                    Louise Schaffner. It'd be cheaper if he'd marry the girl!” At that point we were
                    already becoming serious I should think. But if we told anybody it would
                    discredit us with respect to the arrangements we were making professionally at
                    either end. So we had to keep very quiet about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the consequences, at that point, career wise
                        if you'd announced our engagement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Apart from the fact that it would be awkward in the sense of nobody
                    being sure whether I was speaking for myself or for Willis and vice versa, apart
                    from that, there was not yet a tradition of women staying on in the foreign
                    service. It was just expected that you would retire, which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that this was not a regulation or a
                        rule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It was, well I've never been quite sure myself. It may have been a
                    regulation, or just a convention which was never challenged. I know of only one
                    other instance where the woman went on working after marrying, but her husband
                    was by then retired. Well of course I can see the problem. It still s a problem,
                    of having a couple who need assignments, what are you going to do? You can't
                    have them working for each other. You can have them at the same post, but it's
                    not easy. And placing them is always difficult, so there are problems for the
                    department. But at the same time, I think the department must be confronted by a
                    lot of problems because they can't keep the young men whose wives who have good
                    jobs here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It causes great problems because there's also the feeling
                        that you can't reserve certain posts for just married couples too. You have
                        to be fair to those who aren't married within the foreign service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Exactly. So it means a large post, and it means often a choice post,
                    which is being taken away from somebody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well I was married on May 2, '59 and by that time I had resigned. I
                    don't know the exact date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I came back much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's cover the period after, while you were a foreign
                        service wife. Did, you go up to Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I had already served there of course. So I went back as married to
                    Willis Armstrong, I had a lot of friends. And many of them he already knew
                    because I had given him their names. And they all seemed to be not only very
                    surprised, but very pleased and very welcoming. So it was, in that sense, a very
                    happy way to start one's married life. Fortunately for me, my husband was the
                    kind of person who liked to talk shop. He didn't reveal any secrets, but he
                    enjoyed talking shop. Some men want to get rid of it as soon as they leave the
                    office. And in that sense I felt I was still part of the game, so to speak.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It was Livvie Merchant and then Richard Wigglesworth. I'd briefed him
                    for the post when he was being groomed. I briefed him in the sense of taking him
                    around to see the contacts he needed to make before he went to Ottawa. He was a
                    30 year congressman from Boston, Massachusetts. Wigglesworth had his, he was a
                    New Englander and his wife Florence was from Kentucky. She was a spirited,
                    outgoing person whereas Richard, or Dick as he was known, was somewhat silent
                    and seemingly retiring. But he didn't miss anything obviously. At any rate, what
                    ticked me was as I took him around to meet the people he was supposed to meet,
                    he was writing everything on the back of an envelope, literally. But a very nice
                    likeable man. And she lent a great deal of sparkle to the situation. We all
                    enjoyed her.</p>
                <p>It so happened though that he thought he was indestructible. He came from
                    Massachusetts, and when the cold weather set in, he went arounhe was lucky if he
                    wore galoshes, he rarely wore a topcoat. He used to worry us all. But in the end
                    what did him in, and he died in office, was a blood clot, which seized him when
                    he was on a trip I think, somewhere in French Canada or Montreal. It may have
                    been Montreal. And of course [he] was hospitalized there. But he didn't survive.
                    I guess he had a stroke. It was pretty much immediate and very shocking. So he
                    was to be replaced by Livingston Merchant who was going to serve a second tour
                    there. But in the meantime, Livvie Merchant was designated to be on the team
                    that was to negotiate with the Indians and the Pakistanis on Kashmir, the
                    eternal Kashmir dispute. So he was gone for some time on that project. In the
                    meantime my husband had moved from, he succeeded Tyler Thompson as DCM, when
                    Tyler was transferred to Finland. And therefore as DCM, he was charg�. And he
                    was charg� for a very long time. So that was a very nice experience for him; he
                    enjoyed every bit of it. He was hobnobbing with ambassadors who were treating
                    him as an equal because after all the United States is important enough that
                    even a charge is important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the ruling political and
                        economic elite of Canada at this time? Because I'm sure you were meeting
                        them at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well the thing that struck me was that there was a very small group of
                    elite, intellectually and commercially and socially, but they all knew each
                    other even though they spanned the whole horizontal side of Canada. That is, the
                    people who were upper class in Vancouver and Victoria knew the people who were
                    upper class in Montreal. They had grown up together, gone to the same schools
                    together, gone to the same summer places. It was very unique I think in that
                    sense. But everybody that one met in that group was really very approachable,
                    easy, friendly. For example, if we would go on an official visit to St. John's,
                    Newfoundland, the local governor I guess he was, living in Government House, was
                    an elite member of that community. They would spend their winters in Bermuda or
                    on the Mediterranean. Perfectly charming man. I met the woman who was the wife
                    of the Governor of British Columbia; she was a Montreal woman. Her son, whose
                    name was Turner, later became a political aspirant, never made it to be prime
                    minister. He was Finance Minister. But this is just talking in a sense about the
                    social elite.</p>
                <p>The intellectual elite, they also rubbed elbows constantly. As for the senior
                    bureaucrats, our dealings would be only with those in Ottawa. It would be the
                    Consul General in Toronto, the Ontario bureaucrats and so forth. We couldn't
                    have been luckier with our contacts. There was only one senior bureaucrat, very
                    charming, very affable, who my husband didn't quite trust because of his
                    fundamental anti Americanism. He made Under Secretary of External Affairs. But
                    he was succeeded by a French Canadian named Marcel Cadieux who couldn't have
                    been easier, no anti Americanism whatsoever probably because he was French
                    Canadian. A very able man. But we've just always been in close touch with those
                    people, heads of the department of finance, external affairs and so forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major that you can think of, obviously
                        you'd been on the economics side and all, during this time, but you got

                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well there's always. Fish is always a big problem, both east and west
                    fisheries. We're always invading each other's waters and being accused of doing
                    that. And lumber was an issue of whether, because they have a different tax
                    system for lumber, exploiting and cutting down timber, that it would be selling
                    in the United States at a disadvantage to our lumber people. Must be a half
                    dozen other things. We have the environmental issues always. Our smokestacks are
                    blowing up to Canada, and the acid rain is polluting Canadian lakes. It goes on
                    like that. If you were to subscribe to a publication which is put out by the
                    embassy here, it's very well worth having, I get it free of charge, two thirds
                    of this monthly report has to do with commercial, economic disputes. It's just a
                    fact of life. They're handled amicably enough.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well my husband was in charge through the embassy. And it worked
                    handsomely thank goodness. We had a certain amount of advice beforehand as to
                    what the president required. For example, down pillows no, he was allergic to
                    down pillows. And we were on easy terms with Government House and it's
                    controller, so he and my husband would get together whenever necessary to
                    discuss the further problems that might arise with the hospitality being offered
                    by government house. And everything went swimmingly. The only time you have a
                    problem is with the Secret Service colliding with the Royal Canadian Mounted
                    Police (RCNP), and that's a universal problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, [the Secret Service] are an immovable force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It went very happily. The only trouble is that Government House was
                    always inviting guests of his stature to plant a tree. And he did that and he
                    hurt his back again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It put him on crutches when he went to Vienna to meet
                        Khrushchev.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It was a great colossal mistake, and nobody anticipated that. They
                    should have. And Kennedy I guess was too proud to admit that this was something
                    he shouldn't do. What they should have done was have him throw a few pieces of
                    dirt on the tree and not let him dig anything. But everything went swimmingly
                    and here's an amusing note. After Jackie, who of course knocked them all dead -
                    she had the most gorgeous gowns and she looked so positively entrancing, and she
                    had this demure manner of seeming to hold back and be shy, which she may well
                    have beeafter she'd gone, the Russian ambassador's wife commented that it was as
                    if she herself, she felt like the grandmother and Mrs. Diefenbaker like the
                    mother. You see Jacqueline brought out maternal instincts in all the right
                    places.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Now we were having problems with John Diefenbaker and of course that consumed the
                    embassy and the office back here. Books have been written about it. First of all
                    we had the advance visit of the president's own mafia. These were all guys who'd
                    been working for him from the time he'd been running for office as senator. And
                    they all seemed to come from Revere Beach and were about that caliber of social
                    attractiveness. But they were his boys and they did some stupid and embarrassing
                    things. But the Kennedys themselves won everybody. One of the stupid things was
                    they had to rent tuxedos, these fellows, they hadn't brought any of their own.
                    And there was a place called Classy Clothes from which they rented their
                    tuxedos. And after this preliminary visit, the proprietary visit was over and
                    the real visit was all but taken place, my husband got a call from Classy
                    Clothes which said, “I found a piece of paper in a pocket and somehow I don't
                    think it's something I should be reading.” He was a nice guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there was that piece of paper that Kennedy had left
                    </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: “ that SOB?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “ - that SOB”, about Diefenbaker, and Kennedy said “I
                        didn't know he was an SOB at the time.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: “I didn't think that at the time.” Direct quote. He seemed surprised,
                    quite taken aback. “I didn't think that at the time.” That's been in history
                    books, and I couldn't begin to do justice to it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Mrs. Diefenbaker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: A lovely woman, I liked Olive very much. I didn't dare call her Olive
                    to her face, but I thought she was a splendid woman.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you sense, you'd obviously been dealing with the Canadian scene for some
                    time then in one form or the other, where do you think he was coming from in
                    your estimation. John Diefenbaker?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Well I should know this but it was one of the western provinces and of
                    course he was in a sense, provincial, in that respect. And his appointments were
                    of people to the cabinet who had limited foreign experience. And one I
                    particular was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose name was Green. And he
                    just needed to be tutored on the job all the time, not only by his own people,
                    but by us. He was always very prickly about what the Americans were up to; he
                    was darkly suspicious. On one occasion, at an Iranian reception, he came up to
                    my husband and he pointed his long bony finger and said, “We must have a talk.”
                    Well the entire diplomatic community was all ears. And eventually it developed
                    that what he wanted to talk about was the fact that some Canadian Indians who
                    were sneaking across the border and stealing things, especially from summer
                    camps and stuff, had done this and had been caught in the act by the Americans.
                    And now we held these Indians in our jug, and Green didn't like that. I suppose
                    he would have had to answer to his own constituents; he hadn't been up in arms
                    about it. But this gave him an excuse to be up in arms. And my husband did his
                    best to calm him down. But the next thing that happened came a call from
                    Montreal, from our consulate there and said, “I'm in deep trouble.” A group of
                    American businessmen were up here, no, it was a Greek order, of Greek
                    businessmen or whatever their professions were, a Greek social order. They'd
                    gone up to Montreal for a celebration. They'd gone into a local tavern and
                    partied after hours. The hours for closing and serving drinks were very strict.
                    The police raided the place and clapped them all in jail. So when the Consul
                    General from Montreal called up Bill and said, “I'm in a terrible jam,” and Bill
                    said, “That's the best news I've heard in a long time.” Then he could turn to
                    Green, Howard Green his name was, “What are you doing with my American citizens
                    in jail?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're pointing your finger at me, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: You're pointing your finger at me about some Indians. What about the
                    Americans who're clapped in jail. So things shook up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you sense, I talked to people who served in
                        Mexico and they were saying, our ties with Mexico of course are very close
                        too, that the foreign ministry is sort of where a lot of the, particularly
                        at the top, where a lot of the left wing, sort of anti Americans end up. Did
                        you have any sense </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: It was true in the sense that initially a very distinguished Oxford
                    scholar, Rhodes scholar, was head of the foreign office. The civil servant is
                    the under secretary. So he had the under secretary's job for years and
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Top sort of professional job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: He was venerated in external affairs. He was brilliant and cultivated
                    and so forth. But he was essentially very suspicious of Americans and didn't
                    have sufficient suspicion with respect to the Soviet threat. Livvie Merchant
                    once said about him, “He was a fine man but his instincts were all wrong. So
                    Norman Robertson was his name. He's a Canadian icon, but from the United States
                    standpoint, he was always a problem. Though you'd have this cultural dichotomy
                    frequently of being outstanding Canadians, who were usually distinguished Rhodes
                    Scholars, but they would have a different point of view. I don't think that's
                    true so much any more, but it was then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One does get the feeling that foreign policy is the one
                        place today where the Canadians sort of like to stick it to the United
                        States in a way. I mean, particularly on Cuba and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Cuba is a problem in that sense, but I don't think it worries us. For
                    the most part, we have to give the Canadians credit for standing up to us under
                    a lot of circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I think by and large we can count on the Canadians. It's just these
                    occasional poobahs that give us a problem. And he was a poobah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Ottawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: We left in '62. We were also having the problem, and I'm not as well
                    versed in this, over the extent to which the Canadian military was going to be
                    allowed to develop. Within the military there was a lot of enthusiasm for
                    strengthening their defenses. But we had to share the aerial defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Blue Streak, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: We had a number of problems because we were their protective shield
                    when it came to flying defenses. And we had radar defenses strung across Canada,
                    and we put them up at our expense too. And the Canadian military were eager to
                    expand but the politicians were eager to cut back the funds. Diefenbaker was one
                    of those that maintained that Canada was being taken advantage of unfairly. I
                    should read up on the history issues there because I really didn't expect to be
                    talking about this. I thought I'd be talking about my own immediate
                    opportunities.</p>

                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm really talking about what you were picking up as
                        essentially a professional in a non professional job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: I would be more conversant if I had read up on it. It's just a little
                    too long ago. 1960 is, what is it, almost 40 years ago. I can quickly refresh my
                    memory, but I can tell you there were points of exasperation on military issues,
                    largely led by Diefenbaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact if I recall, he was essentially brought down on
                    </hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: Yes, he was. On having made a promise, which he denied having made or
                    something like that. And that's very significant. And if you ask a Canadian
                    historian, he'll know in an instant what you're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is just on the side for us. To pick up your story,
                        we'll pick it up in '62, when you come back to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARMSTRONG: In the meantime, I'll refresh my memories.</p>
