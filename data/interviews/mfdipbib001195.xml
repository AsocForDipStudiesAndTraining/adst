                <p>Tuch's Early Experience With Voice of America: Munich, 1957</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the circumstances of your joining the Voice of
                        America (VOA) in the first instance back in 1957?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I had just finished Russian Language training preparing to be assigned to
                    Moscow as Press and Cultural Attach�. However, the Soviets were balking at
                    giving a visa to me at the time to add an additional person to our Moscow staff,
                    and indicated that they would only permit one person to do that kind of work in
                    Moscow, and so I was actually footloose and fancy free at that time. Barry
                    Zorthian, the VOA program manager, whom I had not know, asked me to come in and
                    suggested that I go to the VOA program center in Munich, which as you know was
                    broadcasting at that time in the languages of the Soviet Union — Russian,
                    Ukrainian, and Uzbek — and also in the East European languages. He asked me to
                    go there for really two reasons: one, the Policy Officer who was there at the
                    time was Mike Fodor, and old and recognized, distinguished European journalist,
                    I think for the Chicago Post. He had given Dorothy Thompson her start, John
                    Gunther his start. He was getting very old, was almost blind, very hard of
                    hearing, and he was having a very tough time continuing to work. Barry said, “We
                    really need only one policy officer in Munich, but if you could go there and
                    help him, in effect do his job for him, that would be very useful to VOA.”</p>

                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Secondly, he indicated that the of Voice of America had made a major change at
                    that time, in 1957, in its broadcast policy. Until that time, the Voice had
                    functioned primarily as a very tough and explicit cold war organ in its
                    broadcasts, primarily to the communist world. It had been aggressively
                    anti-communist. The decision was made in 1957 that times and circumstances had
                    changed and it would be much more profitable for the Voice to try to become an
                    internationally recognized news organ which was credible throughout the world,
                    which would try to reach the same kind of a reputation as the BBC had enjoyed
                    since World War Two. And that needed, of course, drastic changes in broadcasting
                    approach and language and tone. In Washington, that was being accomplished, but
                    he indicated that Munich, which was doing direct broadcasting to Eastern Europe
                    and the Soviet Union, was not complying, that the tone had remained the same.As
                    a matter of fact, they resented the way Washington had changed the policy, and
                    there was an absence of supervision on the part of VOA management on the
                    broadcasts coming out of Munich, primarily in tone but also in content. So I was
                    asked to help in producing this new tone and new policy changes. And that is
                    what got me to Munich.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Would you describe the role of the policy officer in Munich
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: Mike Fodor had been monitoring what was being broadcast, and then usually
                    on the following morning made his comments about what had been broadcast. And
                    then on the basis of messages from Washington would go down the list of
                    principal topics and issues that were to be broadcast on that day, but did not
                    really have much impact on any change in tone. What I, in a practical sense,
                    started doing, I started writing commentaries and news analyses in the new tone
                    that was, at least in my view, required for the Voice. I had some fascinating
                    experiences in writing these commentaries. I remember one that I offered to the
                    Bulgarian Service — and I'll leave names out at the moment — as something I
                    thought should be broadcast as a commentary, and the then chief of the Bulgarian
                    Service looked up at me after reading it and said, “You know, it's too bad that
                    Senator McCarthy didn't get rid of all the Communists in the Voice of America.”
                    This was kind of the mood and the atmosphere in part of the Voice. Now I must
                    say that the Russian Service in Munich was a first-rate service. Charlie Malamud
                    had been the chief, but he had had a heart attack and so he resigned and Nelson
                    Chipchin was the chief. They had a very old Lithuanian running the news
                    operation, by the name of Grinius; he was first-rate. So you had in your Russian
                    Service a first-class broadcasting outfit. One of the people who was in that
                    service at that time, took was Mrs. (Lucy) Obolensky, who is now married to Eli
                    Flam after her husband's death.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Others were good, too; the Hungarians were first-rate. Some of the Baltic
                    services were quite good. The biggest problem to me, and to everybody else, was
                    the Uzbek Service, because the people did not speak either English or German,
                    which was the second language used in Munich. The only language in which you
                    could communicate with them was Russian, and just having come out of Russian
                    training — this was my advantage—I was able to speak Russian with them, but
                    never really knew whether they understood me or I understood them. There was
                    this fascinating episode. They only had a 15-minute daily broadcast, and of
                    course that was the only Uzbek program broadcast because in Washington there was
                    no Uzbek Service. And because they had only 15 minutes it was very difficult to
                    include in that program anything else but news.I had done a commentary for the
                    house on some subject, and they came to me and said, “We want to broadcast this
                    commentary.” I said, “Well, you just can't do it because it's seven minutes long
                    and therefore you can't fit it into your 15-minute broadcast.” “But,” they said,
                    “We want to do it,” so I said, “All right, I will make two commentaries out of
                    it and you can broadcast one-half each on successive days.” It was, as far as I
                    was concerned, broadcast. But after about three weeks we received a message from
                    our Monitoring Service in Washington, that they could not understand what the
                    Uzbeks had broadcast on those successive days. I asked for a translation, and
                    what happened was, they ran out of time on the first half of the commentary and
                    the next day, so as not to lose any of my very valuable words, they started with
                    the last two sentences of the previous day's commentary and went on. This was
                    the kind of thing we experienced all the time.</p>
                <p>Actually, I spent quite a bit of time writing during my year, because that was
                    really the only way that I found I could influence both the tone and the policy
                    of our broadcasts. The thing that made it difficult operating in Munich was that
                    the then-Director of the Center, Bob Franklin — a very nice person with a
                    marvelous radio voice — was not an effective executive. He had a very difficult
                    time managing the personalities that were involved at that time in VOA. As a
                    matter of fact, there were some VOA old-timers and professionals who had been in
                    it a long time, and they were not willing to take new direction easily. So I
                    spent most of my time trying to affect the broadcasts by writing for them,
                    because it was difficult to reason with the personalities.</p>
                <p>There were one or two occasions when I had a really marvelous time actually
                    reporting.I remember one specific occasion, fairly late in the evening, and
                    there was no one around in the newsroom. I happened to be still in the office
                    because I was waiting for the last program to be broadcast that evening, and we
                    received word that there had been a plane crash at the Munich airport. I took a
                    tape recorder and got into the car and rushed out there, and of course it was
                    the tragic crash of the plane that carried the Manchester soccer team. I was
                    literally one of the first people on the scene, and followed some of the
                    ambulances to the hospital, and started reporting on what had happened. I got
                    more calls from the BBC, from German radio, international calls asking me to
                    report for them on what had happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>At any rate, I left in the summer of 1958, July '58, to be transferred to Moscow,
                    finally, and at the same time a major change was made in the Munich center. John
                    Albert was assigned as the new director and was also directed to change the
                    approach. They no longer did direct broadcasting from Munich. We (JA and I) had
                    only about a week together at the most. Bob Franklin was transferred, and John
                    Albert was left to make the complete change (having been informed via cable from
                    Washington while he was en route to Munich that he was to drop direct broadcasts
                    and cut back to a “program center” from a “radio center”). Some of the people
                    who haworked there were then transferred to Washington and remained there for
                    many years, and did very well. There were several people that I was very fond
                    of, who I thought were first-rate.Piltti Heiskanen for one; he stayed on in
                    Munich. Bob Jellison, who had been in the newsroom, got other Foreign Service
                    assignments and later succeeded me in Berlin as PAO where he then died of a
                    heart attack. But for me, it was great fun with the Voice, because despite all
                    the problems you had, the thing that impressed me then at the Voice, which was
                    really confirmed later on, was that outside of the Foreign Service, the Voice
                    was the one professional operation in USIA. Everybody was a professional who
                    worked there, and whether you had disagreements or unpleasantness they were all
                    professionals and whatever needed to be broadcast, it went on the air, not a
                    minute late. This is something that had always impressed me about the people at
                    the Voice.And of course there was also the esprit de corps. They were real
                    professional broadcasters, not amateurs at what they were doing.</p>
                <p>Departure From Munich - Moscow Assignment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after your experience in Munich, you went back into the
                        regular Foreign Service. What was your acquaintanceship or relationship with
                        the VOA in Moscow and in subsequent assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>TUCH: Initially, it was too close as far as I was concerned, because at that time
                    the Voice was jammed in the Soviet Union, totally jammed, with the exception of
                    English language broadcasts, which had never been jammed. But in most cases, the
                    frequencies on which English programs were broadcast were so close to the
                    frequencies on which Russian and other Soviet languages were broadcast, much of
                    the English was very often obliterated. One of my principal initial duties was,
                    every night, not to monitor the broadcasts but to monitor the jamming, and to
                    identify the individual hammers. For that I had to learn Morse Code, because the
                    Soviet jammers identified themselves every 30 seconds with a Morse Code signal.
                    By recording these individual identifications, and then traveling around the
                    Soviet Union, we could identify individual jammers, where they were and what
                    frequencies they were jamming. This was done purely for technical reasons, and
                    was a very, very boring exercise. I tried to pass it around to my embassy
                    colleagues. We made up schedules so that people took turns listening in the
                    evening and recording the jammers. But they held me to these monthly reports of
                    identification of jammers, and that continued until the time it was determined
                    we had really identified all the jammers and knew where they were, and so they
                    let me off the hook for a while. The English broadcasts were our lifeline to the
                    West, because that was the way we in the embassy got our information, from the
                    Voice of America and also from the BBC. It was then that I became a really
                    confirmed Voice of America listener, and continued to listen throughout my
                    Foreign Service career whenever I was abroad.</p>
                <p>Various Relationships to VOA While In Other Assignments</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:When you were in Brazil, you once proposed the abolition of
                        the VOA Brazilian Service and the conversion of those funds to local
                        television production (by your staffer Hugh Foster) in Brazil. Lillian
                        LaMacchia (the head of the Brazilian Service) to this day has never forgiven
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH:She's never forgiven me. As a matter of fact, she generated a vicious attack
                    upon me in O Globo, which is one of the major papers in Rio. The correspondent
                    of O Globo was a close friend of hers and also a purchase order vendor for the
                    Brazilian Service.</p>
                <p>I was always concerned about the Voice as an instrument, a medium for conveying
                    information from America, and I felt strongly that in certain areas of the
                    world, and under certain conditions, it was not only the most important medium
                    for conveying information, but it was the indispensable medium. Especially to
                    certain denied areas of the world — the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China,
                    certain parts of Africa, certain parts of the Arab World — not only was it the
                    best but our only means of conveying information. In Brazil, I felt differently.
                    I felt, first, that we did not have a very good signal, and it was not going to
                    be improved. Secondly, the effect of our broadcasts, as compared first of all to
                    other radio listening, we did not have a very large audience. Thirdly, I felt
                    that the use of our resources for radio broadcasting in Brazil could be used
                    more effectively with other media.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>This is something I have felt all along. That was one of my main arguments with
                    Ken Giddens when he was director of the Voice of America and was my boss for
                    those few months. He wanted the Voice to broadcast in all the languages of the
                    world, everything the Soviets broadcast in. I felt we should only broadcast to
                    those areas where it was an effective instrument of information, possibly the
                    first, second or third most effective instrument. I never felt we should
                    broadcast to Japan and I never felt we should broadcast to Germany at that time
                    because, one, it was a media-saturated society and the Voice would not really be
                    heard very effectively in those countries. Secondly, there were many other
                    sources of good information, of uncensored information that the Germans and the
                    Japanese could hear on radio and in other ways. Thirdly, it would take us at
                    least five to ten years to build an audience if we were broadcasting. And
                    fourth, I felt that the expenses, the costs of starting a broadcast and
                    continuing broadcasts to those countries could be used much more effectively in
                    other media, like exchange programs or in the print medium, but not radio. And
                    the fifth reason was that our technical resources were so limited that we could
                    not accommodate all our priorities with the technical resources that we had
                    available, so if we had added other languages like German or Japanese we would
                    have had to take away from the priority languages such as Chinese or Russian,
                    and I felt this should never happen, that indeed we should go the other
                    direction and increase our broadcasts in Chinese and Russian if we could and
                    possibly eliminate other things that we were broadcasting where it was not such
                    an important medium.</p>

                        upon VOA by your during the period before you came back to the Voice as
                        Deputy Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>TUCH: Very much. When I came back from Moscow I became first the deputy area
                    director and then the area director for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. And
                    I think it was an accomplishment of mine — Henry Loomis was then the director of
                    the Voice and he wanted to modernize the Russian broadcasts and the Russian
                    Service, and he felt the only way he could do that was if he, in some way,
                    honorably, got Alexander Barmine to give up his service as the chief, and
                    replace him with someone who was much more contemporary in terms of Soviet and
                    Russian activities, policies, experiences.I sacrificed myself and took on
                    Alexander Barmine as my special assistant for Soviet affairs, “uptown” at USIA,
                    and we got Terry Catherman, who was my successor in Moscow, to become the new
                    chief of the Soviet Branch, which then became a Division. He was able really to
                    modernize the Russian broadcasts, first of all by bringing in Americans who
                    spoke Russian, with an accent, certainly, but who had had recent experience in
                    the Soviet Union, as exhibit guides or students, and thereby were able to
                    complement the very old-time Russians who had been in the Service over the past
                    twenty years. Terry and I were very close friends, and so whatever we could do,
                    uptown, to support the broadcasts... Everybody who had ever served in the Soviet
                    Union — Pic Littell was the first, and Terry and I were the next two — we were
                    absolutely convinced that the broadcasts, even through jamming — and of course
                    jamming was halted in 1962 when the U. S. and the Soviet Union signed the first
                    partial nuclear test ban treaty — but we felt that these broadcasts were so
                    vital for us, so important to maintain and augment and improve, that we would do
                    everything possible to accomplish that. So my relationship at that time,
                    especially with the Russian Division, I got to know them quite well and worked
                    closely with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Then I went off to Sofia, that time with the State Department, and the Bulgarians
                    continued jamming the Voice, the only East Europeans who continued to do so.
                    Leonard Marks, who became the director of USIA in, I think, 1965 after Carl
                    Rowan, left, came on a visit to Sofia, accompanying Senator Magnuson, who was
                    the official American representative at the Plovdiv Industrial Fair, at which we
                    were exhibiting for the first time. He came actually a couple of days ahead of
                    Sen. Magnuson, and I met him. I had not know him before that time. I was charg�
                    at the embassy then, and he said, “Tom, you're in charge so don't mind me. I'm
                    just going to go with Senator Magnuson. You decide where I should accompany him
                    and where I should stay out of the way.” Of course we arranged for a visit by
                    the Senator to Todor Zhivkov, the head of the Communist Party and also of the
                    government. I said, “Leonard, You've got to come along, it will be very
                    interesting,” and Leonard came along with Senator Magnuson to meet Zhivkov. And
                    Leonard said, “I'm just going to sit there, I'm going to be silent, I'm not
                    going to say a word, so don't worry about me.” I said, “I'm not going to worry
                    about you, Leonard.” Well, Leonard Marks could sit still only so long, and
                    finally popped up and said, “Mr. Chairman, I really have only one question to
                    ask of you: Why do you still jam the Voice of America? The Soviets have stopped
                    jamming, every other Eastern European country has stopped jamming, but you
                    continue to jam the Voice of America.” Todor Zhivkov, who was not known to be
                    very quick on the uptake, in this case, was. He said, “Mr. Director, I can stop
                    jamming the Voice of America just like that. But if I did that, what would you
                    and I then have to talk about?” He said, “As a matter of fact, Mr. Director, I
                    will stop jamming the Voice of America under one condition: that you grant
                    Bulgaria most-favored-national treatment.” Marks laughed. This was really the
                    extent of my relationship with the Voice of America except that we continued to
                    listen to the English broadcasts on a daily basis.</p>

                        experiences, you returned to Washington and wound up as Deputy Director of

                        appointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>TUCH: I was at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy that year as the Edward
                    R. Murrow Fellow. I had been abroad for eleven years, and was assigned to the
                    Fletcher School, which was something that I felt very pleased about. It's a
                    marvelous assignment, and I spent most of my time teaching public diplomacy.
                    This was a two-year assignment and I expected to be there for two years, but
                    after one year one day I got a call from Jim Keogh, the Director of USIA, asking
                    me to come down to Washington for a conversation with him.I really didn't know
                    what it was all about. And nobody else did either. I came down, and he said, I
                    would like you to break your assignment at the Fletcher School and come back
                    down and be the Deputy Director of the Voice of America. It broke my heart, but
                    on the other hand, if you're asked by the Director — and it was a very
                    responsible job for me — and he was quite honest with me about why he wanted me
                    to take on this job. He said that he did not have a good relationship with Ken
                    Giddens — as a matter of fact they were hardly speaking with one another — and
                    he wanted me to really go down to the Voice and be his surrogate there.</p>
                <p>“Well,” I said, “This is almost impossible to do. My loyalty would obviously have
                    to be to the Director of the Voice, and how could I be both the deputy director
                    of the Voice and then be responsible to the director of USIA?” This was in
                    September, and I'd be coming down on the 15th of October. And he said, “You
                    don't really have to worry about this; no matter how the elections come out on
                    November second, two weeks hence, I will quit, so I will be gone, and if the
                    Democrats win, so will Ken Giddens be gone. So you will not really have any
                    problem as between myself and Ken Giddens.” So on that basis I agreed, and I
                    started on October 15.</p>
                <p>First Day On Job Crisis: Threatened Firing of VOA News Chief, Bernie Kamenske</p>
                <p>And on that morning came my first major crisis at the Voice of America. I arrived
                    at 8:30 — I really knew hardly anybody; I knew Jack Shellenberger, who was the
                    program manager — and was just getting myself settled in the office, when I got
                    a call from Mr. Keogh to come uptown to USIA headquarters right away. (I had met
                    Ken Giddens the week before; we had had lunch together and were quite honest
                    with one another. I told him what I had been told by Jim Keogh, and he reacted
                    accordingly, saying quite frankly that he didn't want me, that he wanted to
                    choose his own deputy, but understood that this was not in the cards and
                    therefore let us work together. We agreed, and as a matter of fact we did work
                    very well together. We had a good relationship — until the day that he was
                    fired.)</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Anyway, I went uptown, and I was confronted by Mr. Keogh, Gene Kopp, his deputy,
                    the head of Personnel, and the General Counsel. I was told that the first thing
                    I was to do that day at VOA was to fire the news chief, Bernie Kamenske — whom I
                    had not yet met — because the previous day he had gone public in the Washington
                    Post with a blast at the U. S. Government because of a broadcast the previous
                    week by our VOA correspondent in Jerusalem, Charlie Weiss, who had stated in a
                    broadcast that he had checked some information with the PLO with regard to a PLO
                    attack on Israeli forces. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv, Malcolm Toon, had blasted
                    the Voice of America for being in touch with the PLO because nobody in the U.S.
                    Government — no official American — was ever to have any kind of contact with
                    the PLO. He, as Chief of Mission, had to be consulted, and if he had been
                    consulted he would have denied our correspondent the opportunity to check a fact
                    with the PLO. Bernie Kamenske, who was a very proud and independent, and a very
                    good, very competent news editor, decided he could not take that kind of
                    interference and went to the Washington Post and gave them a statement. I said,
                    “Look, I could not really, as my first task on my first day at the Voice of
                    America, fire the news chief. My credibility in the whole organization would be
                    shot, and I could never reestablish it; I can't do that.” “Well, you have to do
                    it.” I said, “Let me go back and sort things out and I will come back with my
                    recommendation, but I will not initially fire him.”</p>
                <p>I went back to VOA, and consulted the director, and he said “You do whatever you
                    want to do, I don't talk to the people uptown,” something to that effect. So I
                    asked to see Bernie Kamenske, and he came to my office, and we met and sat down.
                    I listened to him and he told me the story. I reacted, saying, “Look, what you
                    did is unacceptable to me from one point of view only: namely, that if we're
                    going to be colleagues and if we're going to work together you cannot blind side
                    me on anything. If you feel that you have to go public and you cannot resolve
                    your problems internally, you owe it to me to tell me first. Or in this case you
                    owed it to my predecessor, Vallimarescu” — which he had not done the previous
                    weekend. I said, “Let us come to an understanding right away: that in this
                    particular case I will go uptown and try to defend you. However, we have an
                    understanding that you will never do this again without telling me first.” And
                    he agreed. So I marched back uptown, with the same kind of a group, now
                    including the Security chief, and I said I really cannot fire him.If anybody is
                    going to fire him, you will have to do it because I will not. Finally it was
                    agreed that he should get a letter of reprimand.</p>
                <p>But I had done my bureaucratic homework, and I said, “Fine, let us give him a
                    letter of reprimand, but you know I am not authorized to sign such a letter.
                    Only the Director of Personnel can sign official letters of reprimand.” I left
                    it at that, and there was never a letter of reprimand.</p>
                <p>VOA Director Ken Giddens Fails to Resign When Administration Comes In; Is Finally
                    Removed April, 1977</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So this was my first day at the Voice. And then I spent three and a half very
                    happy years there, I must say. One of the first major problems was the Ken
                    Giddens, whereas all other presidential appointments, upon the accession of a
                    new administration, would resign, and left automatically, Ken had no idea of
                    resigning. As a matter of fact, he felt that any administration, Republican or
                    Democrat, would be just delighted to have him as director. He had been there for
                    seven and a half years and therefore it never entered his mind that he was going
                    to resign his job. For a few weeks, no attention was paid to that as the new
                    administration came in, but after the Inauguration questions were beginning to
                    be asked. He stayed till April 9, and on April 9, in the morning, I received a
                    call. Gene Kopp, who had been the deputy director of USIA under the previous
                    administration, had stayed on as deputy director during the transition while
                    John Reinhardt was waiting to be confirmed as director. John had been named but
                    not yet confirmed on that date, if I remember correctly. Well, Gene Kopp called
                    me over and said, “I want to tell you that I've just had a call from the White
                    House ordering me to call Ken Giddens and tell him today is his last day, and I
                    just wanted to let you know beforehand.” So I went back, and by the time I had
                    gotten back to the office Ken had gotten the call, and was shattered, literally
                    shattered. He did not believe that anything like that could ever have been done
                    to him. He left the office; he went home. The word, of course, spread
                    immediately, and the following week we had a very good farewell party for him.
                    He was very emotional about it, and I think this is something he's never
                    forgotten. And then there was a five-month hiatus while a new director was being
                    selected. It was made clear to me that I would not be appointed director because
                    they were just not going to appoint a career officer to what was a political
                    job. Finally R. Peter Straus was named, and really didn't have much of a problem
                    being confirmed. He came on, as I recall, in August as the new director of VOA.
                    R. Peter Straus had been the president of Straus Communications Corporation, the
                    flagship of which was WMCA in New York, a very successful radio station.</p>

                        major problems you confronted early on in his administration?</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>TUCH: My personal relationship with Peter Straus was first-rate. We got along
                    very well. I found him to be a very bright, intelligent individual, very fast on
                    the draw, very “New York,” and his timing in everything he did was first-rate,
                    until the last thing he did, when he resigned from VOA, and I'll come to that
                    later. But he was a bright, interesting, interested person. His one problem was
                    that he was not really committed to or interested in running the Voice of
                    America, which, after all, is a major — let's put it — corporation. It's a very
                    big establishment. It had at that time 2,200 employees, a budget of $60-70
                    million, and it was a big enterprise, managerially. He was not really very
                    interested in running such an enterprise. He was interested in being the head of
                    the Voice of America, in appearing in public as the head of the Voice of
                    America, in putting himself before the public and the Congress as the head of
                    the Voice of America, but he was not interested in managing the Voice. Which in
                    a way was nice for me because he left it to me. The only problem I had sometimes
                    was in some of the things that he suddenly got interested in a promulgated
                    without any further consultation with anybody. For instance, one of the first
                    things he did — he had never heard the term GMT, Greenwich Mean Time, before,
                    and at that time all of our broadcasts were identified by Greenwich Mean Time.
                    Because they were broadcast to all areas of the world, you didn't use local
                    time. Audiences were used to GMT because most international broadcasters used
                    the term, but he thought it was silly and so from one day to the next he said,
                    “We will no longer use GMT on the air.” So when I asked him, “What will we
                    use,”: he said, “You will say, it is now five minutes before the hour or six
                    minutes after the hour.” Not very serious, not very substantive.</p>
                <p>There were a number of issues he obviously had to get involved in, major issues
                    that we confronted. One of them certainly was the new technology. He was not
                    interested in that, but he supported it. I felt one of the really major
                    accomplishments of the Voice during those year, '76 to '78, was our
                    technological improvement in transmitting the Voice broadcasts. The principal
                    one was that we started using satellite circuits in feeding our broadcasts
                    across both the Pacific and the Atlantic to the overseas transmitters. The
                    satellite signal was first-rate, like a local station. By eliminating the hop,
                    you improved the quality of your broadcasts 100%. The reason it was initially
                    difficult was because one of our major problems at the Voice at that time was
                    the competence of the engineering staff. The previous engineering head, Ed
                    Martin, had left — this was before my time — after being transferred to the
                    director's office as a “consultant.” And a man by the name of Ken Langenbeck
                    came in, and his credibility within the engineering staff was nil. He was one to
                    resist going satellite, and it had to be done over his objection.</p>
                <p>Difficulty With VOA Engineering Department</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The engineering department was difficult for me from a management point of view
                    because I'm not an engineer, and I had great difficulty sorting out who was
                    competent there and who was not. What we finally did was, we went to SRI, which
                    was then still called Stanford Research Institute, and asked some of their
                    people to do a survey for us, as a consultant, to determine what kind of
                    engineering staff we had and how competent they were to do the job for VOA. We
                    got a very mixed report from them which was not terribly helpful to me, because
                    I still didn't know whether Ken Langenbeck and his staff were competent
                    engineers or not. But the engineering management for me became a major problem
                    since I didn't know whom to go to or whom to trust or whom to work with. It
                    turned out later that Ken was accused by our Agency Inspectors of having done
                    something illegally in a bidding process in going to one bidder and telling him
                    the bids of the other competitors, and he left somewhat under a cloud from one
                    day to the next.</p>
                <p>Problem of Outside Meddling In VOA Broadcast Policy</p>
                <p>The second major issue during my time at the Voice, and the one that really
                    engaged me the most, and one I really wanted to be involved in — I had been a
                    believer in the Voice as a medium of conveying information, and I felt very
                    strongly that we must support and build up the Voice so that it is a worldwide
                    credible news organization, and we could do that only if we protected the Voice
                    against outside interference — which came all the time. It was this kind of
                    protection that management could give to the Voice news operation to make it the
                    reputable organization it ought to be — independent, objective, comprehensive
                    news organization that it was chartered under the law to be. Outside
                    interference came from practically every direction, practically every day. We
                    received telegrams almost daily from ambassadors abroad saying the lead news
                    story was entirely inappropriate for the Voice that morning; it was wither too
                    long or too short or it shouldn't have been broadcast at all; it was
                    embarrassing to the U. S. Government to have this news story; that it was too
                    high up in the newscast, or too low down in the newscast — this kind of thing.
                    Secondly, we would get calls from the Department of State, from desk officers,
                    from assistant secretaries, saying such and such was happening that day, but you
                    cannot broadcast it on the Voice, or the State Department spokesman would make a
                    statement we we'd be told, “Don't broadcast that statement to Afghanistan, or
                    don't broadcast it to Brazil.” This kind of thing was done all the time. I must
                    say that John Reinhardt, who was director of USIA at the time, was first-rate in
                    backing up all my decisions on that, both when I was acting director and when we
                    had a director who didn't want to get involved in such issues. Initially,
                    whenever I got such a telegram or such a call, I would call him and say, “I got
                    another call from the State Department,” or “I got a telegram from this or that
                    ambassador,” and he said, “Well, it's in the news, isn't is?” And I said, “Yes.”
                    And he said, “Well, why don't you just throw it in the wastebasket? After all,
                    nobody interferes with news broadcasts of the Voice, right?” And I said, “Yes.”
                    And he said, “Well, do it!” On two occasions, when it became a really critical
                    issue, he actually accompanied me and represented me in the confrontations.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>But the most interesting thing that gave us at the Voice a lot of heart in this
                    issue was at one of the authorization hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. The chairman at that time was Senator Percy, who claimed
                    co-authorship of the law that established the Charter as a law, and was very
                    interested in the Voice and very supportive of the Voice, but very critical if
                    the Voice did something that he thought should not have been done. He stated to
                    me at one of those hearings where I was the witness, “Mr. Tuch, if you let
                    anyone, inside or outside the government, here or abroad, interfere in any way
                    with the news broadcasts of the Voice of America, you are breaking the law.”
                    This is very comforting coming from the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. The two occasions where I got into serious trouble in forcing this
                    kind of even-handedness on the Voice was, the first time during the Panama Canal
                    Treaty discussions, where of course it was U. S. policy to support the
                    conclusion and signing of the treaty, and certainly I was in favor of it. But
                    some of us, I think you included, felt that the Voice owed it to itself to
                    broadcast some of the responsible discussion opposed to the Panama Canal Treaty,
                    including that of Ronald Reagan, and because there was a considerable amount of
                    what we considered responsible opposition to the treaty, whether you agreed with
                    that or not. I remember we asked Senator Laxalt to come over and appear on a
                    Press Conference USA and the following day I got a call from Zbigniew Brzezinski
                    in the White House. “What the hell are you doing over there in the Voice of
                    America, giving Senator Laxalt a platform?” I said, “Well, this is our
                    obligation under the Charter, under the law.” “Well, don't you ever do that sort
                    of thing again.” Period.</p>
                <p>Several months later, we asked Paul Nitze, who at that time was chairman of the
                    Committee on the Present Danger, to appear on Press Conference USA in his
                    opposition to the SALT II Treaty. I remember we had a little session in my
                    office first, with a discussion with him that was interesting, and he went off
                    to the studio for the broadcast. The next day I got a call to appear at the
                    white House before Mr. Brzezinski. On that occasion I called up John Reinhardt,
                    and he and I went together. We explained that the Charter of the Voice obligated
                    us to present U.S. policy and responsible discussion thereof. We felt that Paul
                    Nitze was probably the most responsible person we could find to discuss
                    opposition, which was certainly strong in this country. There again it became
                    pretty unpleasant, but we marched out of there — John was with me all the way,
                    he was perfect. I've always appreciated that. But, in sum, I thought we did
                    accomplish quite a bit. Obviously I'm not an objective observer there, but we
                    accomplished quite a bit to raise the worldwide credibility of the Voice during
                    that period by letting the newsroom really operate without any outside
                    interference. And whenever they got it they would report it and we would make a
                    fuss about it. And we would tell Bernie and his staff, whether the duty editor
                    or the slot person, “Forget it. Don't worry about it, just forget it.” And then
                    we would take it up.</p>
                <p>Chalmers Roberts Report Results In Change of Status of VOA Reporting Abroad</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the origin of the Chalmers Roberts group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>TUCH: That was another issue which came up during that time, starting with
                    Charlie Weiss's problem with the PLO. The thing was really initiated out of the
                    news division, and it was presented to management that the Voice of America
                    correspondents could not really be the kind of persons supporting and working in
                    the news division if they were abroad as correspondents but also as U. S.
                    Government officials — meaning that they would travel on official passports,
                    that they had their offices in embassies or related to embassies, that they
                    would get their housing, they would be part of the embassy structure, and that
                    they could not function as correspondents in that position, and recognized as
                    being in such a position abroad. The suggestion was made that if we really
                    wanted to have credible, comprehensive newscasts, our correspondents have got to
                    work on the same basis as correspondents for commercial or other international
                    news services. We proposed that the correspondents be separated, so to speak,
                    from the U. S. Government. They would still be U. S. Government employees, and
                    obviously receive their pay from the U. S. Government, but for all intents and
                    purposes they would go overseas as any other news correspondents for a
                    commercial network or newspaper do, whether it's the New York Times or CBS or
                    BBC.</p>
                <p>Peter Straus was not particularly interested in this issue. As a matter of fact,
                    correspondents were a problem to management, always were. This was a problem he
                    didn't need. Why do we have correspondents at all? They were very expensive, and
                    they were causing all kinds of difficulties to management all the time, so why
                    even have correspondents? There was, however, great pressure on him from inside
                    the Voice that we institute this new procedure, and he decided to have an
                    independent outside consultation by responsible news executives and reporters to
                    give him advice on whether this should be done or not. I suspect he hoped that
                    they would come up with the conclusion that correspondents were not essential to
                    the Voice of America, thereby then avoiding the whole problem. Chalmers Roberts,
                    who at that time had retired from the Washington Post but was still writing for
                    them, was made the chairman of this commission, and there was Pauline Frederick,
                    and a couple of other people with good reputations on the commission, and they
                    came in with a report saying that correspondents are absolutely essential if the
                    Voice of America is going to be a credible news organ. No ifs or buts.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>With that recommendation, we drafted several papers outlining the operating
                    procedures and responsibilities of VOA correspondents, replacing the old
                    Circular Airgram 800. We got the Agency to promulgate that, and that literally
                    separated VOA correspondents abroad from USIA or U. S. Government establishments
                    in almost every way. Ambassadors still, of course, had the right to comment on a
                    correspondent's report after the fact, which to my mind is perfectly reasonable.
                    The decision after the fact, however, would not be made by the State Department
                    but by the VOA leadership. The one difference of VOA correspondents from other
                    correspondents was that our correspondents would only report the news, not
                    comment on it. They would not be used as commentators or news analysts because
                    that would compromise them, but what made them so valuable to the Voice was to
                    be a responsible news person on the spot to report the news so that we could
                    depend upon him or her for the credibility and the objectivity and
                    comprehensiveness of the news broadcast. We did not have to depend, often, on
                    other sources. We had, of course, the two-source rule, which had always applied
                    at the Voice, dating back to the forties, I understand, but the one exception to
                    the two-source rule was our own correspondent. I think, from at least my point
                    of view while I was at the Voice, and then for the next few years when I was
                    abroad and listened to the Voice, that worked very well. The problem that was
                    still facing us was that we felt we should have more correspondents, and the
                    Agency, and certainly Peter Straus at the time, did not feel we needed more
                    correspondents, so as long as he was there we didn't add. After he left, during
                    the following six months, we did add at least two correspondents to the corps,
                    and of course now they have many more.</p>
                <p>Origin of VOA News “Commentaries” (Editorials)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember Peter Straus's insistence that he had to
                        be able to go before members of Congress and say that the American taxpayer
                        had gotten his money's worth for nine minutes this week, in the form of
                        three editorials? Some of us felt like saying, “We feel the taxpayer gets
                        his money's worth every day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” This was
                        the beginning of the VOA editorial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: We still called them commentaries while I was there. The compromise we made
                    at the time, after long discussions, was that we would have two things: a news
                    analysis, which would merely analyze the news, and not given an opinion on it;
                    the other thing would be that our commentaries would be like an editorial and
                    would be introduced as an official comment on whatever. We obligated ourselves
                    to do commentaries very frequently, practically daily, but that was the
                    compromise. On the other side of the compromise was that we would write the
                    commentaries and not clear them with anybody else, but they had the right to
                    object or complain to us after the fact if they felt that our commentaries had
                    not reflected U.S. foreign policy adequately. But the determination would be
                    made in-house by the VOA policy staff.</p>

                <p>TUCH: Certainly one of the highlights came when I was in the fortunate position
                    of being acting director. I mentioned earlier that Peter Straus's political
                    timing was near perfect when he was director of the Voice, but he made one
                    serious mistake, namely, the timing of his departure, his resignation. I don't
                    know, frankly, whey he departed so suddenly from the Voice. I know he had some
                    differences with Jody Powell, and I also know he had some differences with John
                    Reinhardt, primarily differences of prestige — that he was responsible to the
                    director of USIA and therefore was second to him — or whether it was his desire
                    to become more politically active. He and his wife had been very active and had
                    actually managed the senatorial campaign of Robert Kennedy, and he, I believe,
                    wanted to become very active in the potential campaign of Teddy Kennedy. He left
                    the Voice very abruptly, from one day to the next.</p>
                <p>While he was director, he had tried to be on a major television show at least
                    once a month, or to give a major speech once a month, or to have a major comment
                    in the newspaper about him or by him once a week. He liked that very much; this
                    was part of his way of operation.</p>
                <p>B. Tehran Hostage Crisis</p>

                    Suddenly the Voice was in the limelight because we were the only ones who were
                    communicating with the public in Iran. We were broadcasting to Iran, only a
                    half-hour at that time in Farsi, but we were communicating, and we heard from a
                    couple of hostages who were not with the others that they were listening daily,
                    and suddenly the Voice was in the public limelight. All the television networks
                    and the local stations and newspapers came around for interviews and reports
                    about the Voice of America broadcasting to Iran. Practically nightly for two or
                    three weeks we were on the major network shows. I just remember that I was
                    standing in front of the CBS camera, and all I could think of before the
                    question was asked was, Eat your heart out, Peter Straus! Being on a network
                    news show every night of the week. But, at any rate, I must say that our ability
                    to respond to that crisis, and getting ourselves started in broadcasting in
                    Farsi, and building our broadcasts from a half-hour to a two-hour broadcast
                    within six months, I thought was a major accomplishment — of the Voice, not of
                    mine. Allan Baker, who was the division chief for the Near East, was a
                    professional, as his colleagues were, and we got the Farsi broadcasts on the
                    air.</p>
                <p>C. Updating Language Broadcast Priorities and Upgrading Transmitter
                    Facilities</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>At the same time — and you and I worked very closely together on this — we were
                    asked by the National Security Council (NSC), by Brzezinski himself, “What can
                    the Voice do to improve its broadcasts to the Islamic World? What needed to be
                    done, how should it be done, how much money was needed, how many new
                    transmitters were needed, and where?” So we, the two of us, did two things.
                    First of all, we did a language priority study updating the one that had been
                    done in 1970 and updated in 1974 — and this was 1979. We did a very careful but
                    a very realistic, and simple to read, study of what languages the VOA should be
                    broadcasting in at that time, in what priority, and the number of hours, and how
                    we could achieve that within a reasonable time, and what that time would be if
                    we had the resources to do so. The second study was one determining where the
                    shortages were in our capacity or capability of broadcasting to a certain area
                    in a certain language for the appropriate length of time, and what the
                    trade-offs in the priorities were, and what we needed to improve our technical
                    capabilities. Those were two studies which were sent to the NSC, and were
                    accepted and approved. Actually the budget for the following year was determined
                    on the basis of these two reports, and actually the beginning of the
                    modernization program dates to that time.</p>
                <p>We felt very strongly that we needed one major additional relay station, and we
                    felt that Sri Lanka would be the best place for it, both geographically and
                    politically. The one area of the world that was very inadequately covered by the
                    Voice, technically, was Central Asia, the part between European Russia and
                    China, so we felt strongly that a new relay station with a number of high-power
                    transmitters broadcasting northward from Sri Lanka would really fill that
                    particular technical gap. On the other hand, by augmenting the Philippines and
                    augmenting our capability in Kavala in Greece, and in England where the BBC was
                    operating transmitters for us, we could do a fairly adequate job of covering the
                    work, technically. We were also augmenting our relay station in Monrovia, and we
                    made the decision, and started before I left, the medium-wave relay station in
                    Botswana. We had a very tough time initially persuading the State Department to
                    let us even negotiate in Sri Lanka for our relay station there. They did not
                    want it, but finally agreed that we should try, and of course our successors
                    have been working on that ever since then.</p>
                <p>D. Personnel Problems</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So I would say that the two areas — there is one other, but the two areas that
                    really required or occupied my priority interest at the Voice were the news
                    credibility of the Voice and the technical improvement of its signal. And
                    thirdly, personnel problems. We always had personnel problems at the Voice, in
                    some respects completely inevitable. You have a professional organization of
                    some 40 or 50 nationalities together under one roof, some of the nationalities
                    never having gotten along with their neighbors, some within themselves. There
                    were constant pressures and tensions, some within language services — the Czechs
                    and the Slovaks, the Serbs and the Croats, the Estonians and the Estonians, the
                    Chinese, and in some of the language services, like the Russian, the old-time
                    Russians with the Americans Russians, and the American Russians and the recent
                    emigres. There were just constant tensions, some of which were almost impossible
                    for management to address because we didn't understand the languages nor did we
                    understand the issues. Fortunately we had some people in management who had
                    served in these areas and who knew the issues and were aware of the tensions and
                    could sort them out. For instance, Paul Modic had spent a lot of time in the Far
                    East, and certainly managed the Chinese in his way very well. I couldn't. On the
                    other hand, I was able to manage more of the problems with the East Europeans
                    and the Russians because I had spent time there and was studying and interested
                    in the area. And then you had the problems between the Greeks and the Turks. It
                    was just constant.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we felt there were certain areas in personnel where we felt
                    improvements could be made. For instance, in not having any kind of
                    discrimination between the English language broadcasting personnel and the
                    foreign language broadcasting personnel. That was one issue. Then there was the
                    issue of civil service personnel and foreign service officers like myself who
                    did tours of duty at the Voice. Obviously the civil servants felt that there
                    were professional broadcasters and these outsiders who came in for one
                    assignment of three or four years were not professional broadcasters and they
                    were usually put in supervisory positions, thereby preventing the civil service
                    broadcasters from going ahead in their career as they felt they should. On the
                    other hand, the foreign service people felt that they had the immediate contact
                    with the area, they had the recent experience in the area to which we were
                    broadcasting, which the civil service broadcasters did not have, and that
                    therefore they could make a valuable contribution. I thought that they could.
                    But all these became major personnel issues that among reasonable people could
                    be worked out. We at least addressed them, and tried to work at some of the
                    worst ones. Of course we had to deal with two unions: AFGE, that we were
                    constantly negotiating with, and we had the technical people's union, the NFFE.
                    And then there was also the question in which Peter Straus as director was very
                    active, and that was abolishing any discriminatory practices, whether on race,
                    religion or sex, that had been practiced.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>The major one there was the sex discrimination question, because many of the
                    women in VOA, and I thought absolutely correctly, felt that they had been
                    discriminated against in terms of their advancement as broadcasters. On the
                    other hand, you had the very real question of cultural differences in other
                    countries and other areas of the world. Let's say the Arab World: in trying to
                    convey information to an audience, a woman broadcaster, it was felt, could not
                    do this job adequately. Women would not be accepted broadcasting political
                    information; cultural, yes, but not political. In a number of services it took a
                    long time and considerable pressure to persuade them to use American
                    contemporary standards, namely, that you did not discriminate against women in
                    their professional work. I think that slowly discrimination was abolished. I'm
                    not sure in every respect, but at least we had fewer complaints towards the end
                    of my tour than in the beginning. Peter Straus formed a committee and asked me
                    to chair it, of people in VOA, including women, including a union
                    representative, including you, and we met at least once a week to discuss the
                    problem of discrimination against women, and we looked at complaints and we got
                    reports. Betty Ross was the sort of rapporteur, and she kept statistics on how
                    the Voice was doing.</p>
                <p>It was not only a question of sex, but in the Russian Service, for instance, who
                    would broadcast in Russian? People with a Ukrainian accent were not permitted to
                    broadcast to the Soviet Union because it was felt demeaning. On the other hand,
                    we had people speaking with American accents, and we had to force that down the
                    throats of the Russian staff, though only in cultural and feature programs. At
                    any rate, it was a question that was persistent, but we addressed it, we
                    grappled with it. Towards the end I had the feeling there was not too much that
                    was still being complained about. There was a long period where the English
                    language women in the newsroom, the journalists, complained that they were not
                    permitted to broadcast their own stories. Since the feeling among the producers
                    was that the quality of their presentation was not up to VOA standards, we set
                    up training courses for these women to bring the quality of their work up to
                    standard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other recollections do you have that you'd like to
                        talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I think that one of the things I should give you is my folder on the Voice,
                    and a number of memoranda that I wrote, either to the director of USIA or
                    internally, that might be useful as ancillary documents to this particular
                    interview. I did produce a memo to my successor, Mary Bitterman, who came in in
                    March of 1980. Peter Straus had left in October, and I was acting again. When
                    she came in she brought in a new deputy director, Bill Haratunian, an old Voice
                    hand, a Foreign Service officer who had been with the Voice many, many years. I
                    left her a memorandum with things that had not been completed, for her and Bill
                    to address themselves to. There were a number of things; for instance, we did
                    not have a new engineering director. (And of course, the one that was found
                    didn't stay long afterwards.) But there were a number of issues that were still
                    to be addressed.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>My time with the Voice, I must say in retrospect, was one of the most fascinating
                    periods of my career. I still consider the Voice of America one of the most
                    professional outfits I've ever been associated with. And within USIA I continue
                    to believe it is the most professional organization in every respect. I think
                    the best example I can cite to confirm that impression is that during the huge
                    snowstorm in 1977 that paralyzed the U. S. Government it was announced that only
                    people who were indispensable should come to work. The next day the Washington
                    Post did a story on who was indispensable to the government. They went to all
                    the Departments, and at the State Department they found that only the Iran task
                    force was indispensable; nobody else was working. On the other hand they found
                    that everybody at the Voice of America was indispensable because everybody was
                    working. I remember two or three heartwarming incidents. In the Korean Service,
                    the staff just could not get in from Virginia, and the chief of the service
                    called in and had himself hooked up by telephone to the Voice and broadcast the
                    Korean program from his home. There were several instances like that, and it was
                    just amazing that with all the problems, and all the internecine tensions and
                    pressures, the professionalism was superb at the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say, as a loyal VOA hand, I found very high
                        professionalism in the Television and Film Service when I was transferred
                        over there, and in the Press and Publications Service when I was there. So
                        there is professionalism throughout the institution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>TUCH: I never worked in those. But that makes it sort of a wonderful experience
                    to be associated with an organization where there are true committed
                    professionals.</p>
