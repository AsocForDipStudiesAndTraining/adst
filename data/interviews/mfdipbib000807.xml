                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Ambassador Joseph Mendenhall
                        made under the auspices of the Association for Diplomatic Studies at DACOR
                        Bacon House in Washington D.C. on February 11, 1991. I am very happy to grab
                        this opportunity while you are here on one of your annual visits to the
                        United States to get recorded some of your history and add to our collection
                        of what makes the Foreign Service run.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: As an old friend from our retirement days, Ambassador Torbert—may I
                    call you Tully? Can we be informal on this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly may.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I am delighted to collaborate with you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that we are on first name terms again, the best way to
                        start off this interview is for you to tell us a little bit about your
                        initial interest in the foreign affairs field and how you came to get into
                        the Foreign Service. Then we will continue with your various posts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Well, like so many things in life, Tully, I got into the Foreign
                    Service, at least partly, perhaps even largely, by accident. I did develop an
                    interest in the foreign affairs field in particular during World War II when
                    part of my service was devoted to operating a war orientation room following the
                    developments in the war. I also was considerably influenced during that period
                    by two books by Walter Lippmann—”U.S. Foreign Policy” and “U.S. War Aims”—which
                    did a lot to define my thinking in the foreign policy field and in that era. To
                    be more specific, after about four years in the armed forces I just happened to
                    be in Washington after assignment to the Office of Strategic Services in July,
                    1945 and was between training assignments for OSS, when one afternoon having
                    nothing better to do I said to myself, “Why don't I go down to the State
                    Department and inquire about Foreign Service examinations.” I was aware that
                    none had been given since our entry into the war. I found out at the State
                    Department that indeed the first—it wasn't exactly a post-war examination, the
                    war was over with Germany but we were still at war with Japan at that stage—the
                    first examination in years was scheduled and applications were then being
                    accepted and there was only one more week to the deadline. So by accident, as I
                    say, I got my application in. There was nothing to lose, I didn't know what else
                    I was going to do. I thought I would investigate all possibilities of
                    conceivable interest for what I might do after the war was over and I was
                    demobilized. I did take the first examination while I was still in uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was about August...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: No, it was in November, 1945. I took it at Aberdeen Proving Grounds.
                    The two-day examination—I don't think I have to go into what it consisted of, I
                    am sure you have that in your historical records—what I did to prepare for it
                    was to review my college notes for about three weekends prior to the time I took
                    the examination. That apparently worked because I came through the written—I
                    don't remember the score—but I came through quite well, as I recall. Then I had
                    to wait about eight months for the oral examination. In the meantime I had been
                    demobilized and was married shortly thereafter. I had a civilian job with the
                    interim successor between OSS and the establishment of the CIA. That interim
                    successor was called the Strategic Services Unit at the War Department. I got
                    married, went off for a week on a honeymoon, came back to Washington and found
                    that my job had fallen through. So here I was with a new wife and no job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had almost the same experience at the beginning of the
                        war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I pounded the streets here for about three weeks and then was rehired
                    by the Strategic Services Unit as an editor and analyst on reports coming in
                    from China. I worked for that organization for several months and while I was
                    there took the oral examination in June, 1946. I succeeded in passing that but
                    still I had to wait, of course, for the call of entry into the Foreign Service.
                    That came in August and then came the first big decision. I had been told by the
                    president of my oral board that I had sufficiently impressed the board that they
                    were going to recommend that I come in at the next instep grade higher than my
                    age warranted. In other words, instead of coming in at the grand salary of $3600
                    a year I would come in at $3900 a year. When I received the summons to duty by
                    the State Department it said $3600 a year. Well, I was already making $4900 a
                    year at the Strategic Services Unit, which made that a substantial drop in
                    income. I rushed down to the personnel section of the State Department, talked
                    to an old gentleman who, I think, subsequently became an ambassador and was
                    never a favorite of mine because of the outcome of my conversation with him. He
                    gruffly looked through my files and said, “There is nothing in here about such a
                    recommendation by your oral board so you will come in at $3600.” I explained my
                    dilemma and he said, “Well, we are offering you a career and you don't have one
                    where you are.” So after considerable pondering I did decide to take this drop
                    in salary and come into the Foreign Service. As a matter of fact I didn't get
                    back to $4900 until I think three years later in the Service. I went through the
                    then month of training here in the Department. We were asked to submit our
                    preferences for post assignments. There was much hilarity among the group of
                    entrants saying they would be meaningless, but I put down first, Peking, since I
                    had been working on China here in Washington; second, Vienna, I think for
                    romantic reasons—had I gone to Vienna at that time it would have been a scene of
                    very considerable war damage; and third, Istanbul. To my great surprise we got
                    Istanbul. I think that was also a romantic decision simply because of
                    Constantinople's long place in history for a couple of millennia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get in to Istanbul, do you mind going back a
                        little bit and giving us a couple of hundred words on your total military
                        career because that is a very useful thing to have as most of us who came in
                        about that time had military experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Tully, I can't lay claim to any very distinguished military career. I
                    was in the second batch which registered for selective service in July, 1941. I
                    had just had one year of law school at Harvard and I thought I could at least
                    get a second year. To my consternation within a month after I had registered, I
                    received my draft notice. This was August and by October I was inducted into the
                    army as a buck private and was sent into the infantry. I had two months of
                    infantry training when Pearl Harbor day came. At that point the powers to be in
                    the armed forces decided to pick up 1300 of us at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, where
                    we were in infantry training, and send us down into the swamps near Tampa,
                    Florida as the nucleus for the establishment of a signal aircraft warning
                    service. The fear at that time was that the United States might be subject to
                    air attack and we were setting up an aircraft warning service around the borders
                    of the United States and also of Latin America. So I spent about three or four
                    months being trained as a radio operator. I could have told the army that since
                    I had no ear for music that the “dit-dah-dits” were pretty difficult for me. I
                    think I finally got up to 16 words a minute, but I never would have made much of
                    a radio operator.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I kept trying to get in an application to go to Officer Candidate
                    School, but I was told repeatedly that I was on temporary assignment and my
                    application couldn't be accepted. So many months went by until the summer of
                    1942 when I finally got my application accepted and I managed to get into
                    Officer Candidate School at Miami Beach. After three months there I got my bars
                    as a second lieutenant.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to air force intelligence in Yuma, Arizona for about two and a
                    half years. It was interesting for a while, but I know in retrospect that I
                    stayed far too long and toward the end was becoming annoyed with this
                    assignment. A recruiter from the Office of Strategic Services passed through,
                    interviewed me and I indicated an interest in transfer to OSS. I heard nothing
                    more.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile I was transferred to an overseas replacement depot in North Carolina in
                    preparation for shipment to Europe. While I was on route there, V-E Day came. So
                    that project disappeared. Then I was placed in an assignment for the Pacific.
                    But before that actually came through the OSS decided to summon me to
                    Washington. I went into training for OSS, specifically Korean language training.
                    I had been in that two weeks at the University of Pennsylvania when V-J Day
                    came.</p>
                <p>So, as you see, my military career has nothing very exciting to say about it. I
                    did while I was in intelligence at Yuma, Arizona, operate the war room which did
                    get me interested in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I also add as a footnote to this account of my military experience that I would
                    have been, probably, one of the first soldiers out of the United States in
                    February, 1942 had a great catastrophe not taken place. I was sent from my
                    station in Florida with about 1700 others by train to Fort Dix, New Jersey to be
                    shipped overseas. While we were on the train, the old French liner Normandy was
                    sabotaged, turned over and burned in New York harbor. After four weeks of doing
                    nothing in Fort Dix, New Jersey we went right back to the post in Florida from
                    where we had come—that camp in the swamp. There we learned that we had been
                    scheduled to sail on the Normandy. Where we would have gone I was not powerful
                    enough to find out from the War Department. But I assume since it was the signal
                    aircraft warning service, it might have been Latin America or it could have well
                    been Northern Ireland, because we were at that point just beginning to send
                    troops there. So between February, 1942 and May of 1945, when I again was slated
                    to go overseas, I was on domestic assignment here in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I spent four years in the Ordnance Department in the
                        United States. Your having taken the exams in Aberdeen impresses me because
                        that was the closest overseas post I had in the army. Lets get back to
                        Istanbul. Do you want to describe what you found when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I went over on the boat with another officer who had just entered and
                    when we arrived in Istanbul we learned that the Ambassador in Ankara wanted to
                    assign one of the two new arriving officers to the single political slot in the
                    Consulate General in Istanbul. I already knew that political work was supposed
                    to be the glamor part of the Foreign Service so I was eager for this assignment.
                    But I lost out to him because his French was better than mine. I could read
                    French perfectly on the basis of what I had done in college, but I didn't dare
                    open my mouth anywhere. He had had some experience during the war as a liaison
                    officer with the French. The Ambassador to my disappointment, but I must say
                    quite fairly, chose him over me for the political assignment.So I went into the
                    economic and commercial section. It was largely a commercial section. I had some
                    economics in college, but I must say it had done very little in the way of
                    preparing me for Foreign Service economic work. When I arrived there were two of
                    us in the economic section. An old officer who had been in the commercial
                    service of the Department of Commerce first and later been integrated into the
                    Foreign Service, and myself. He left after several months. He was not at all a
                    trainer. I learned very little under him, but after he left I had to sink or
                    swim because I was the only officer in the section for a while.</p>
                <p>I began to dig in after several months and did begin to learn my way around. I
                    took over, for example, his monthly financial reports which were of significance
                    because although the Embassy in Ankara did the financial reporting on the budget
                    of the government, most of the other financial reporting was done for the
                    country as a whole from Istanbul because it was the financial and commercial
                    center of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I really had to learn my way around in that field. I remember interviewing
                    bankers every month to get my information for this report and I scarcely knew
                    what questions to ask. But I guess I came through all right because I remained
                    friends with these bankers and I began to get some commendations on my financial
                    reports from Washington.</p>
                <p>Then I began to do several other types of reporting in this field. One of which
                    in particular I have always remembered. I prepared a special report, voluntary
                    report as we used to call them at that time, on the foreign investment policies
                    and procedures with respect to Turkey. Today that wouldn't sound very
                    significant with all the private organizations as well as official organizations
                    that prepare this sort of thing. But 45 years ago that kind of thing didn't
                    exist. There was nothing at all in private or official literature on how to go
                    about making foreign investment in Turkey. I prepared this report and was told
                    later by an official here in the Department that that report remained the
                    standard one on foreign investment in Turkey for upwards of a decade. So I have
                    always been rather proud of what I did on that. I remember I gathered all the
                    information I could and wrote the report and then submitted it to the leading
                    American businessman in Istanbul for review. He had very few comments to make.
                    In fact he indicated that as far as businessmen were concerned it met their
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I did in the way of reporting of some significance in
                    Istanbul was to prepare special reports on the import and export systems of
                    Turkey and also on barter trading which at that time in Turkey was called
                    compensation trading. The Turks had learned a lot from the Germans during the
                    previous decade. The Germans had been very significant in furthering barter and
                    clearing trade as it is called. The U.S. had never been very much involved in
                    that, but even today there is considerable barter trading between the West and
                    Eastern Europe. Certainly there was before the East European countries got their
                    freedom. I suspect with their foreign exchange shortages there still is. And
                    that was the main reason for so much barter trading then. Nobody had much
                    foreign exchange.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I had to do as part of my financial reporting in Istanbul
                    was to try to dig out of Turkey's central bank branch in Istanbul what the
                    foreign exchange reserves of the country were, they were classified at that
                    time, and how much might be made available for imports. At that time, the
                    American businessman who came to Turkey, including such significant firms as
                    General Motors, came in and his principal question was “Do you have any idea how
                    much foreign exchange our distributors might be able to get in order to import
                    from us.” That was the day of the dollar shortage all over the world. Just the
                    reverse of the situation today—there is such a big dollar surplus everywhere.
                    Interesting how history changes.</p>
                <p>These, Tully were, I think, the more significant things that I did during my
                    service in Istanbul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I had three Consuls General while I was there. The first was Robert
                    Macatee, a very senior Foreign Service Officer, who left within three months
                    after my arrival for assignment as Consul General in Jerusalem. Mr. Macatee was
                    a rather meek and mild man, but I have always considered him a man of
                    considerable courage because his predecessor as Consul General in Jerusalem had
                    been blown up in the great bomb explosion in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
                    Macatee was chosen as his successor.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Clarence Macy. Macy was only an FSO-3 when he came there. He
                    was close to retirement age. He was a man whose career was greatly handicapped
                    by his wife. Macy was a soldier in World War I and met a French lady afterwards
                    and married her. Macy was a man who always had to speak French with his wife. He
                    was absolutely fluent in French but his accent was pure Missouri. His wife had
                    handicapped his career because of a certain peculiarity in her personality. She
                    was pleasant enough to subordinates but she was always nasty to superiors which
                    is just the reverse of what often happened in the Foreign Service. Therefore,
                    poor Macy hadn't gotten ahead nearly as far as I thought his ability warranted.
                    He was a man who had as much common sense as any Foreign Service officer I ever
                    encountered. But the poor fellow had to retire after 18 months in Istanbul at
                    the age of 60 because he had reached the retirement age.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by a man by the name of John McDonald who had been our Consul
                    General in Taipei. McDonald was a younger officer than Macy, who was thought to
                    have considerable future in the Foreign Service, but for some reason he never
                    went very far. I don't know what the story was there. My two and a half years in
                    Istanbul were up within a few months after his arrival and I don't know what
                    became of him afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went off to quite a different part of the
                        world—Reykjavik.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: That is right, I went to Iceland and I will give you the history of
                    why. I left Istanbul assigned to Manila and came back to Washington and went
                    into a training course in the Department of Commerce for a few weeks. While I
                    was in that my Manila assignment was canceled and I was assigned to Jakarta.
                    Meanwhile, the man who had been the economic counselor in Ankara, Edward Lawson,
                    was named as our Minister to Iceland. At that time, as you remember, we still
                    had quite a number of Legations. Lawson was named as Minister and was
                    concurrently going to be the head of the Marshall Plan Mission in Iceland. They
                    didn't have a separate head as in many European countries. He asked me if I
                    would go to Iceland with him to run the Marshall Plan for him. I replied that I
                    would be delighted. But, the Department said he could have Mendenhall if he
                    found a replacement for him for Jakarta. So Lawson spent all summer of 1949
                    trying to find a replacement for me and I didn't know whether to buy tropical
                    clothing or arctic clothing for my next assignment. He finally succeeded in
                    September in getting a replacement and my assignment to Reykjavik was made
                    official and I had to rush around and get myself ready to go to a cold
                    climate.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, when we arrived early October in Reykjavik, the ground was
                    already frozen. We checked in to the only hotel that then existed in Reykjavik,
                    the Hotel Borg and within two nights after our arrival I broke out into a heat
                    rash. Why? Because we were sleeping under eider down quilts. I never have been
                    able to distribute those feathers in eider down quilts in such a way that I am
                    comfortable under them.</p>
                <p>We stayed in Iceland for a bit over two years and both my wife and I learned to
                    love it and the Icelanders. The Icelanders are a very reserved people. Not easy
                    to break into, but if they conclude that one treats them as absolute equals and
                    doesn't make any disparaging remarks about their small country and limited
                    population, pretty soon they take you in and they are the warmest friends one
                    will have in the world.</p>
                <p>I was extremely busy in the Marshall Plan Mission. By the time I left the United
                    States had extended $30 million in aid to Iceland, which I suppose in today's
                    money would be somewhere between $300 or $400 million. I was the only officer
                    administering that whole program. Minister Lawson preoccupied himself almost
                    completely with the diplomatic mission and I did all the negotiating in
                    connection with the Marshall Plan as well as the administering. The Marshall
                    Plan Headquarters here in Washington and the European Headquarters in Paris were
                    mechanisms that churned out immense amounts of paper destined for the much
                    larger missions in other countries and Iceland got every bit of paper that went
                    to everyone else.I had to winnow it out. Just that job alone took a lot of
                    time.</p>
                <p>The substantive part of the job was interesting and required a great deal of
                    time. We constructed three major projects under the aid program—two
                    hydroelectric projects and a nitrogenous fertilizer plant. We worked with the
                    Icelanders to improve their exports, particularly with the United States. We
                    inaugurated a technical assistance program to Iceland and the first project
                    under that was to bring a fish marketing expert from Boston over to advise the
                    Icelanders about their marketing procedures to the United States. One of the
                    things in particular that he recommended was that for the U.S. market you don't
                    need to skin the frozen fish as you do for Europe. The Americans eat the skins
                    so just freeze it and send it—you will get more money that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't happen to remember the name of the Boston expert
                        do you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I can't remember his name. I might add that the position to which I
                    was assigned in the Marshall Plan organization was the equivalent of an FSO-3
                    and I was then an FSO-5. At that stage, remember, we had only 6 numbered classes
                    in the Foreign Service. I was in the next to the bottom. I did get some
                    differential in salary because of this assignment, but the Department would not
                    permit me to draw the complete differential between an FSO-5 and an FSO-3
                    assignment. Typical at that time on the part of the Department, like my argument
                    when I was coming in whether I should get $3600 or $3900. The Department never
                    conceded very much in financial terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They always thought you should be so pleased being a
                        Foreign Service officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: After a little over two years in Iceland, we received our transfer
                    assignment to Switzerland. I was pleased because although we had enjoyed Iceland
                    very much it was pleasant to contemplate a different kind of post which looked
                    as though it might be better in the physical sense than Iceland had been. But I
                    do remember after getting my orders Minister Lawson talked to me about the new
                    assignment and said, “I can see you are pleased with that and I can understand
                    it, but I am not sure it is going to be a very good assignment from a career
                    standpoint as far as you are concerned, because the American interests in
                    Switzerland are so limited that you are not going to be challenged very often”.
                    Well I just brushed this off because I was looking forward to being in the heart
                    of Europe.</p>
                <p>It turned out he was absolutely correct in his assessment of the assignment. The
                    Swiss are so self-sufficient in almost every respect that the United States has
                    never had any very substantial interests in that country as we have in so many
                    others around the world over the past 50 years.</p>
                <p>I found myself in Switzerland assigned initially to the economic section and
                    doing the same kind of reporting that I had been doing in Istanbul at the outset
                    of my career. So Lawson was absolutely right it was not challenging at all.The
                    one thing that was new to me in my work there was the labor reporting activity.
                    I had never had any association with labor before and I did learn what labor and
                    labor organizations were all about. I made the acquaintance of and cultivated
                    the grand old man of the Swiss labor movement, Conrad Ilg. He had been the head
                    of the Swiss movement then for 20 to 25 years. He was the George Meany of
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I remember almost literally sitting at his feet and listening to him as he would
                    talk, reminisce, advise, instruct over the situation not only in Switzerland but
                    that in Europe. He talked to me about Hitler's rise in Germany, which he
                    attributed in very substantial measure to the great depression in the economic
                    field and the extremely high unemployment in Germany. At that time, of course,
                    we were in occupation in Germany and he said, “I urge you to always think of the
                    German economy. Don't let it go into decline. If you keep the Germans reasonably
                    happy economically then you will not have these terrible political problems,
                    which we had in the 30s and 40s in Germany.” I have never forgotten his
                    advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you reported that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I did. After several months in the economic section, I was
                    transferred to the political section which pleased me greatly because at that
                    point, seven years in the service, I still had had no political assignment. As
                    political work was considered the glamor part of the Foreign Service and often
                    the avenue through which to get promotions, I was very pleased to move over into
                    it. The political section had consisted of four officers. This was the time when
                    the Republicans came to Washington, and Secretary Dulles cut back on the
                    personnel strength of the State Department and the Foreign Service and certainly
                    as far as Switzerland was concerned, very wisely so. We were grossly overstaffed
                    in that Embassy. We had four officers in the political section and were cut down
                    to one. We had five in the economic section and were cut down to two. We had two
                    science attach�s and they were both abolished.</p>
                <p>I might add a little personal note to this. My father-in-law, who was a German
                    language expert who examined documents captured from the Germans during the war
                    while in the Navy, in 1947 got a job with the newly established CIA, heading the
                    research and intelligence activity of the CIA related to the UN and other
                    international organizations. In 1950 his entire unit was shifted from CIA to the
                    State Department. When Mr. Dulles arrived in 1953, this was one of the
                    organizations he considered surplus. The whole unit was chopped down. My
                    father-in-law lost his job and decided to retire at that point. Even to his
                    death, just a couple of years ago, he never had any love for John F. Dulles.</p>
                <p>As for my assignment to the political section, I remained in that for about two
                    and a half years. Although it looked fairly good on my record I can't say there
                    was anything very challenging about what I did in that area in Switzerland.
                    Swiss politics are just as stable as the Swiss economy. Nothing very exciting
                    ever happens in the Swiss political world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just rotate chairman of the council don't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Well, there are seven members of the Federal Council and they usually
                    are reelected and serve until death. The presidency rotates every year among the
                    seven. The president is no more significant than any of the other Federal
                    Councilor.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I might tell a little story about the man who was president
                    when we were there, a Mr. Etter. The Swiss are noted for being rather
                    tightfisted and he was typically Swiss in that respect. The story went around
                    that Mr. Etter was seen one day riding on a train in second class. Someone
                    asked, “Mr. President, why are you riding second class?” He said, “Because there
                    isn't any lower class.”</p>
                <p>The Swiss, also, are noted for adherence to law and regulations. There is a story
                    about the Minister of Defense during World War II—a man well-loved by the Swiss,
                    but they tell this story about him. He was also a great devotee of trains and he
                    had a passenger car installed on his front lawn. He and his wife used to go out
                    and sit in it every evening because he loved trains so much. One evening someone
                    saw him and his wife out there trying to push the car back and forward. They
                    said, “Mr. Minister, what are you doing?” He said, “It says inside that you can
                    flush the toilet only when the train is in motion.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal in both internal politics and whatever
                        foreign relations there were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes. I also took my labor reporting over with me to the political
                    section. Besides the old gentleman I was also very close friends with a young
                    Swiss who worked both in the Swiss labor movement and an International Labor
                    Federation in Geneva—not connected with the ILO, an organization of labor unions
                    around the world. I found him one of my best sources of information as well as a
                    very good friend.</p>
                <p>I also took on a political reporting program that the State Department had
                    inaugurated in Western Europe of reporting information that could be gathered in
                    Western Europe about conditions in Eastern Europe. This was known as the
                    peripheral reporting program. One of the four political officers had devoted his
                    time completely to this field. When his position was abolished, I took on the
                    residue of his work. There was nothing of very great significance that we picked
                    up in that area in Switzerland.</p>

                <p>MENDENHALL: They usually had been gone so long that they had nothing of any great
                    significance to report. The one thing of some interest that I remember doing—in
                    the summer of 1953 I was the duty officer for the weekend. I received a
                    telephone call from that great old Foreign Service officer, Alex Johnson—I think
                    he was then a deputy assistant secretary for Far Eastern Affairs. We were then
                    trying to negotiate an armistice with the Chinese communists and North Koreans
                    in Korea. One of the issues was the establishment of a neutral nations
                    supervisory commission. The proposal was that the UN with the US at the head of
                    the Korean group at the UN would choose two Western countries and we hoped to
                    put forward Switzerland and Sweden. The Communists would choose two “neutral”
                    countries—theirs were Poland and, I believe, Czechoslovakia, communist countries
                    from Eastern Europe which were about as un-neutral as any thing in the world at
                    that stage. So I received a telephone call that Sunday. The armistice agreement
                    was on the point of being concluded, but the Swiss had not yet consented to
                    participate. So I had to get hold of the Swiss to see if they would agree to
                    take part and indeed they did agree within a few days. I simply transmitted the
                    message. The armistice was concluded in Korea which ended the Korean War. I
                    can't say I played a very significant role, but at least a minor connection with
                    ending that conflict.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the general run of international conferences was
                        handled from Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, that is right. Other than reporting Swiss reaction to the
                    Conference on Indochina which started in June, 1954—Swiss press reaction.
                    Switzerland was blessed with probably, in my judgment, the best press in the
                    world. When I was stationed there, there were six good newspapers in
                    Switzerland. About half of them in French and half in German. Their editorial
                    reactions to events around the world were of some considerable interest because
                    they were such responsible journalists. I wish I could say as much for the
                    United States today, but I can't.</p>

                        published. It may not have been very exciting, but everything was
                        published.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: As a matter of fact when I was stationed in Switzerland, the Neue
                    Zuercher Zeitung had done three editions per day and none of the news was
                    repeated in any of those three editions. I think the Neue Zuercher Zeitung is
                    probably the single best newspaper in the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: French, my German was never very good, Tully. I read the paper but
                    with difficulty. I should have done more in German. I taught myself while I was
                    there. But I never claimed it was very good. My French was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your Ambassadors while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: The first one was a man by the name of Patterson. He had been a
                    political ambassador to both Yugoslavia and, I believe Poland [it was Guatemala]
                    and then came to Switzerland as Minister. At that time there was only one
                    ambassador in Switzerland—the French Ambassador. The French had insisted since
                    the Napoleonic conquest of Switzerland that their mission be headed by an
                    ambassador. The Swiss to save money would not let any other country raise their
                    missions to the level of ambassador—they did not want to name ambassadors in
                    reciprocity. By that time many of the countries were beginning to push the Swiss
                    pretty hard on his including the Americans. The Swiss finally decided to go
                    along, but not as long as Patterson was there.</p>
                <p>I will tell you a little story about Patterson to indicate the kind of political
                    ambassador he was. One day the Syrian Charg� came to pay his diplomatic call on
                    the ambassador. The ambassador wanted the Syrian to point out on the map where
                    his country was. The ambassador got the Syrian so confused by the time they got
                    up to the map he couldn't point out his own country.</p>
                <p>Patterson was succeeded by Frances Willis who is very famous in the Foreign
                    Service as our first career woman officer to be named as an ambassador. Indeed,
                    very surprisingly, the Swiss who did not even permit women to vote agreed to
                    accept her as the first American Ambassador to Switzerland. I enjoyed very much
                    working for her. She was a very precise lady who knew her own mind. I got along
                    extremely well with her and enjoyed it very much. Not that I think any of us did
                    anything of very great significance in our Swiss assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew her only socially, but I thought she was
                        intelligent...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: She was also a very human individual. When my family and I left
                    Switzerland in June of 1955, we took a train from Bern, about 5:50 AM, for Genoa
                    in order to catch a ship. She, the ambassador, insisted upon being down at the
                    train station at that hour to see us off—a junior officer. This was rather
                    typical of the very human attitude which she took towards all members of her
                    staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now after seven or eight years you were going home—nine
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Tully, here lies a story also. When I left Switzerland I was assigned
                    again to Indonesia. Remember in 1949 I had been assigned there and hadn't gotten
                    there. I was assigned to Indonesia, came back to the States on home leave,
                    bought a car, and sent it off to Indonesia. Meanwhile the Department sent me to
                    the Bethesda Hospital because during the last year I was in Switzerland I had
                    suffered from a series of infections which, despite consultations with all the
                    finest of the Swiss medical community, nobody had been able to diagnose. The
                    Department felt it should be diagnosed before I went to a tropical country. So
                    out I went to Bethesda. They didn't succeed in finding the source of my
                    difficulties, but they did find in the course of the examinations that I had a
                    kidney stone, which had never bothered me and still 35 years later hasn't
                    bothered me. I was told then that it was too big to be passed if it ever became
                    detached. The Department said, “You are going to have to stay in the US because
                    the stone may be new and growing and we don't know what is going to happen to
                    it. You have to be in a place where there is good hospital care.” So my
                    assignment to Indonesia was canceled and I was thrust upon the Department
                    without any preparation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And without the automobile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, without the automobile. It did finally come back. General Motors
                    wrote me a letter and said that this car has put more miles on it without
                    registering anything on the odometer than any car in our history—it had gone all
                    the way around the world.</p>
                <p>As for my assignment since there had been no advanced planning by the Department
                    or by me with respect to it, the Department thrust me into the first and only
                    opening for a Foreign Service officer at my grade that existed at that point
                    which was a job in the Bureau of International Organizations dealing with crime,
                    housing and other social matters. I was less than enthusiastic about this
                    assignment and after one day on the job I went to the Director of the office,
                    Walter Kotschnig and said, “I don't really want this assignment, I want out.”
                    Well he proved to be a gentleman too and he said, “All right, I don't want you
                    to be unhappy in the work here. I want somebody who would like to have the job.”
                    He agreed that I could look for something else.</p>
                <p>I went to Idar Rimestad who was then the man in charge of Washington assignments
                    in the Personnel Division. He was not very happy with my decision at all. He
                    said, “This is the only thing we have got. You should take it.” I again
                    demurred. He said, “You will have to see if you can find anything, we don't have
                    anything for you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So I managed to locate a job with the Office of Greece, Turkish and Irani Affairs
                    as special assistant to the director. I had served in Turkey. The only trouble
                    with that job was that there was no official slot for it and after 30 days the
                    director of the office said, “There is no way in which I can keep you because we
                    don't have any slot.” So here I was again without a job.</p>
                <p>But meanwhile there was another opening in the Department at my level doing
                    economic work in the Office of Southeast Asian Affairs in the Bureau of Far
                    Eastern Affairs. The closest I had gotten to the Far East and Southeast Asia was
                    Turkey which is about half a world apart. I knew nothing about Southeast Asia.
                    But I accepted the assignment faut de mieux—there was nothing else.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough that proved to be the start of a 15 year association on my
                    part with Southeast Asia. I devoted the balk of my career to it. And I have had
                    not regrets subsequently, although I was not very happy at the outset.</p>
                <p>I worked for two and a half years in the economic section of the Office of
                    Southeastern Affairs during economic work with respect to Thailand and Burma. I
                    learned a good deal, particularly on finding one's way around the bureaucracy
                    here in Washington. As you know, Tully, economic work here in Washington is
                    probably more complex, certainly more time consuming than political work because
                    there are so many agencies in our government which are interested in economics.
                    In the political field one may have to clear with Defense and possibly CIA, but
                    in the economic field in so many areas one has to clear with anywhere from 3, 6,
                    8, or 10 agencies and it has become enormously difficult to get a decision.</p>
                <p>One of the most difficult areas in that respect was the old surplus agricultural
                    commodities agreements, so-called PL 480 agreements. I think they had more
                    clearances on them than any document I have ever seen throughout Washington. So
                    it put me in touch with a lot of people and one had to find his way around in
                    order to try to get clearances.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I will give you another example of that. I remember a meeting which I attended, I
                    think it dealt with Burma, at which the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs
                    presided, the number two man from the aid organization, then called ICA was
                    present, and our Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Bureau
                    of Far Eastern Affairs. The subject of the meeting was one of considerable
                    dissent and I have never seen a meeting end more in a shambles than that one.
                    There was disagreement on everybody's part. As I walked out with the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs, Howard Jones, who later became our
                    ambassador to Indonesia, he turned to me and said, “Would you draft a telegram
                    on the consensus of this meeting.” I sort of looked taken aback and walked back
                    to my office and said, “The only consensus I know is my own point of view on
                    this. I'll draft a telegram reflecting my own point of view.” To my great
                    surprise it went through all these high ranking officials who had been at the
                    meeting expressing diametrically opposite points of view—all signed off on the
                    telegram. Well, that proved to me the veracity of one of the adages around the
                    Department that policy is made on the basis of the cables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is correct. The drafting officer has the whip
                        hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: It certainly was in that case.</p>
                <p>I will give you another interesting experience I had, again in connection with
                    Burma. Burma has never been a very significant country in American foreign
                    policy. At that particular stage we were devoting, I think much more attention
                    to it than subsequently, because we were very interested in preventing Burma
                    from slipping into the communist bloc. But it was very difficult to get any
                    funds out of Washington for Burma because it had not rated very high in the
                    significance of our foreign policy. But in 1956 we got word, I think from our
                    Embassy in Rangoon, that the two highest ranking officials of the Soviet Union
                    then, Bulganin and Mikoyan, I think, were due to arrive in Rangoon the next day.
                    Well, that really set the alarm bells ringing here in Washington. The Burma desk
                    officer and I drafted a telegram authorizing a $25 million loan to Burma. Now
                    there would have been utterly no chance of getting that cleared through the
                    American government a day before. (That would have been the equivalent of $250
                    million today.) We managed to get that telegram through the government in less
                    than six hours because the two highest Soviet officials were arriving in Rangoon
                    the next day.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>One of my great obstacles had been the working level official in the Bureau of
                    Economic Affairs. He would never agree to anything, nor would his boss, an
                    office director. Well it was late enough at night when we were drafting it that
                    we had it signed off by the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs as they had
                    gone home. Then we took the telegram to Walter Robertson, the Assistant
                    Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, who often took a lot of authority on himself.
                    But he decided he couldn't sign off for the Department on this. He would try to
                    get ahold of the either the Secretary or the Under Secretary. Well, they had
                    both left for the day, so he called the Under Secretary at his home. Since this
                    was a highly classified telegram, Robertson read it to him sotto voce over the
                    telephone. The Under Secretary, then Herbert Hoover, Jr., agreed. Robertson
                    signed it and our $25 million loan authorization went to our Embassy in Rangoon
                    to be passed on to the Burmese government.</p>
                <p>The epilogue to this, I think the telegram arrived garbled so that the offer
                    couldn't be made prior to the arrival of the Soviet guests. It was subsequently
                    made by the Embassy. But even ten years later that loan had not been completely
                    disbursed by any means.</p>
                <p>The lesson of that one to me is this. Don't be unduly afraid of what your great
                    enemies might offer in the way of aid. It is not necessarily going to swing a
                    country into their camp. I took this lesson to heart many years later when I was
                    in Laos as director of the AID Mission. A Soviet Embassy official came in to me
                    and wanted a briefing on our AID program. I gave him a very frank briefing, it
                    was all in the public domain. I turned to him and said, “We would be delighted
                    to see you make a major contribution to the foreign exchange stabilization fund
                    here.” I never saw an official show such instant fright and get out of my office
                    so fast in my life as he did when I made that suggestion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the rules I always had on the finance of certain
                        countries at least, was that you can't buy it, you are lucky if you can rent
                        it for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I couldn't agree more, Tully.</p>
                <p>There is another aspect of my service in Washington during that point that I
                    think is somewhat worth noting. You know Henry Kissinger, when he was the
                    National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, talked about the “conceptual”
                    approach to foreign policy, as though this was something that he had
                    invented—that we had never had it in Washington history before. But as I look
                    back in the late 1950s, we were following precisely that kind of approach in
                    determining how we were going to conduct ourselves towards any specific country.
                    We used to write lots of papers, first determining what are the U.S. interests
                    with respect to that country, what are our objectives, and what policy should we
                    be following to serve our interests and achieve our objectives. That is the
                    “conceptual” approach as I understand it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in many respect I found that the Eisenhower
                        Administration for all the faults that we all know, was the best, most
                        orderly in the determination of any time I have had any contact with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: This was that era. I think I would agree with you in retrospect.</p>
                <p>May I just add a point while we are on this question of drafting of documents
                    defining U.S. interests, objectives and policies. One of the things that used to
                    annoy me at that time and continued to do so throughout my career, was certain
                    Foreign Service officers, particularly desk officers, who used to like to put
                    down as one of their objectives, “maintaining friendly relations with a foreign
                    country.” This meant that whenever a foreign country wanted something they were
                    always inclined to give it to them in order to maintain friendly relations. I
                    used to stoutly maintain that this could never be a U.S. interest or objective.
                    It might under certain circumstances be a policy in order to achieve an
                    objective, but there are times that you want to slam-bang the desk with a
                    foreign country and be tough with them, whatever the effect may be on your
                    relations. Maintenance of friendly relations in and of itself is not an
                    objective, can never be in my judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it is a systemic weakness of diplomacy very
                        often that you are afraid to make anybody mad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>About this time you began to get in to the Vietnam business?</p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes. After two and a half years of economic work, the Director of the
                    Office of Southeast Asian Affairs, decided to switch me over to the Vietnam
                    desk. I was very interested in this job. After all, the desk officer was then
                    and I assume still is in the Department in many ways the principal focus of the
                    U.S. towards the country concerned. So I was very happy to take on this
                    assignment. I might say that at that time the Vietnam desk officer ran not only
                    political matters, but all the economic matters with respect to his country.
                    That was true of all the Indochina countries, it wasn't true of the other
                    countries in Southeast Asia. I had handled Thai and Burmese economic matters but
                    not political matters when I was in the economic unit of the office. But that
                    economic unit did not handle economic matters, for some anomalous reason, with
                    respect to the Indochina countries, the desk officers did. So I had
                    responsibility for all aspects of U.S. policy and operations vis-a-vis Vietnam.
                    At that time we had only one officer on the desk. I don't know what it is today,
                    but I know before I retired, the Department had mushroomed and you had two or
                    three desk officers dealing with countries.</p>
                <p>There is one particular case I would like to raise in connection with my Vietnam
                    Desk experience here in Washington. I think it is worth noting for
                    posterity.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>One of the principal things that arose during my tenure of about a year and a
                    quarter on the desk, was approving the armaments and training of the civil guard
                    in South Vietnam. The civil guard was a paramilitary organization similar to the
                    Gendarmerie in France, which I thing probably was its predecessor, since the
                    French had control in Indochina, or the Carabinieri in Italy. We in the United
                    States don't have anything exactly like it. We have either military
                    organizations or police organizations. We don't have something that stands sort
                    of half way in between.</p>
                <p>Well, the Vietnamese wanted because of the increasing insecurity in the
                    country—the communists had already launched terrorists activities and
                    assassinations in 1957-58—to improve the arms of the civil guard. Unfortunately,
                    President of South Vietnam Diem's proposal was to give the civil guard tanks and
                    artillery, which was ridiculous as they would then be no different from the
                    regular military. But there was an intermediate way of stepping up the quality
                    of their arms and finally we got the Vietnamese government to agree to request
                    the right kind of arms. The request came back to Washington through ICA, the
                    predecessor of AID, which had a very strong police program.</p>
                <p>It got here and the head of ICA said that this was not a regular police police.
                    Which I think was quite right. He said, “This is not something which I think ICA
                    should get involved.” The Department of Defense was not about to take it on
                    either because the civil guard was not included in the approved military
                    personnel ceilings for military aid which had been approved by the Joint Chiefs
                    of Staff for military aid programs in South Vietnam. So here we were falling in
                    between the two stools. I kept pushing ICA on this and finally the head of the
                    organization said he would do it if he got a direct order from John Foster
                    Dulles, the Secretary of State. So I drafted a direct order and Dulles signed
                    it. ICA then agreed to undertake this program. As it turned out, the head of ICA
                    was fundamentally right. ICA could not do a proper job of training and arming
                    the civil guard. It was too big an organization. It was far bigger than any
                    police program they had ever taken on. The civil guard consisted of about 50,000
                    people. This problem was never really resolved until about three years later
                    after John Kennedy became President and had authorized a big increase in our
                    military personnel and funds in Vietnam and finally induced the Department of
                    Defense to take over the program. That was the really efficient way that it
                    could be handled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any question of it possibly be handled by CIA at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: No, because I think it was also too big to be handled by CIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>One other thing that I did during that period was to handle Cambodia as an
                    additional duty for a few weeks during the summer of 1958 while we were between
                    Cambodia desk officers. I remember the office director said to me, “I am rather
                    reluctant to intrust Cambodia to you because Vietnam and Cambodia are
                    traditionally and historically at loggerheads. You are the Vietnam desk officer
                    and are apt to be rather prejudice in favor of Vietnam. But I don't have any
                    alternative so you will have to take it on.”</p>
                <p>Well I handled it for a few weeks and was very pleased when my temporary service
                    came to an end and he said to me, “You have treated this with very fair
                    objectivity.”</p>
                <p>During that period Prince Sihanouk, who even then was the head of the Cambodian
                    government, paid his first visit to Washington. It was not an official visit in
                    the strict sense of that term where he is invited by the President and therefore
                    President Eisenhower would have nothing to do with Sihanouk while he was here.
                    He would not work him into his busy schedule. I understand the President has a
                    busy schedule, but when people like Sihanouk, leaders of small countries, could
                    go to Peking, or to Russia and get all the honors and attention from the heads
                    of those governments, when they came here and didn't get the same thing, on a
                    number of occasions, I think, it worked very substantially against our
                    interests. We could not get President Eisenhower to agree to see Sihanouk, the
                    best we could do was to get him received by the Secretary of State, John Foster
                    Dulles. Sihanouk had shortly before diplomatically recognized Communist China.
                    That was at the time that the U.S. was holding a line very strongly against
                    further diplomatic recognitions of that country. Sihanouk did it because there
                    had been one of the periodic flaps in Vietnamese-Cambodian relations over a
                    little border marker in the wilderness, which had been blown up to such
                    proportions that he decided to resort for diplomatic support to Peking and
                    recognize them diplomatically.</p>
                <p>He arrived here with this very recently on his record. I accompanied him on his
                    call on Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, whose
                    meeting was almost completely a lecture to Sihanouk on the evils of
                    communism—predictably the way Walter Robertson would handle it. Then I
                    accompanied Sihanouk to his meeting with John Foster Dulles. Dulles had this
                    reputation of being an anti-communist fire eater. This was the only time in my
                    career that I was ever in Dulles' office and I have never forgotten the way he
                    handled Sihanouk. He didn't take the Robertson approach at all. He took a very
                    philosophical approach in talking with him. He explained to him that we felt
                    that the containment policy vis-a-vis the communist countries—both China and
                    Russia at that time—was the one to follow because if we held that line over time
                    those communist regimes might begin to change, to modify themselves. To be sure
                    that is what eventually happened in both China and the Soviet Union. It is not
                    the kind of attitude normally associated with Dulles, but he expressed that
                    point of view and I think in view of what subsequently happened in 35 to 40
                    years of history it proved rather prescient. I think that is something that some
                    of these anti-Dulles academics and writers might take into consideration some
                    time. Of course, I don't know if this is even in the public record. It should
                    be.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure about this particular incident, but the idea
                        has been discussed in the last few years by scholars, partly stimulated by
                        Eleanor Dulles, perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I witnessed this and I can testify to it. I am sure I have a
                    memorandum of this conversation between Sihanouk and Dulles in the official
                    files.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is an extremely interesting point of view. Was there
                        anybody else that you worked with in the Far Eastern Bureau besides
                        Robertson that was particular impressive at the time, or that you remember
                        as an influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, I have already mentioned Howard Jones with whom I have worked
                    considerably when he was economic deputy assistant secretary. Graham Parsons
                    came in as the political deputy assistant secretary in the summer of 1958.
                    Interestingly enough, Graham Parsons has probably told this himself in his oral
                    history, but this is another incident of my diplomatic career which I have
                    always remembered.</p>
                <p>Walter Robertson, as you know was the key man in holding the line against
                    Communist China in the 1950s. When Sihanouk recognized Communist China Robertson
                    happened to be away and Graham Parsons was holding the fort there. Our
                    ambassador in Cambodia, Carl Strom, had done everything possible, knowing the
                    policy of the U.S. government, to try to prevent Sihanouk from proceeding with
                    diplomatic recognition. His cables sounded increasingly desperate as they came
                    in. Then a copy of an outgoing cable came across my desk which Graham Parsons as
                    the Acting Assistant Secretary had sent to Carl Strom in Phnom Penh. It was a
                    cable which was very understanding of the anguish that an ambassador in a remote
                    country knowing that U.S. policy vis-a-vis his country was in a sense going down
                    the drain was going through. I happened to be in Parsons' office right after
                    that. He turned to me and said, “I went through a similar kind of experience as
                    ambassador to Laos. I knew how lonely and distant from Washington he feels under
                    circumstances like that. He needs something that bolsters him in the way he is
                    handling himself.” Again a human approach based on previous experience in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that is as good a justification for a career
                        Foreign Service as you could make. You went from there to Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, I had been told when I became the desk officer that, if I
                    handled that job properly and the ambassador in Vietnam, it was Elbridge
                    Durbrow, agreed, that in the summer of 1959 when the assignment of the then
                    political counselor in Saigon expired, I could succeed him. And that was the way
                    it turned out.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I arrived with my family in Saigon in August of 1959 and served there for three
                    years in what proved to be one of the two most challenging and interesting
                    assignments of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Director of the AID Mission in Laos. Not as Ambassador to Madagascar
                    which was less interesting.</p>
                <p>In Vietnam I arrived when the security situation was already deteriorating in the
                    countryside. In a few months, by January, 1960, the war, as I define it,
                    actually started. In January, 1960 there was an attack on a regimental post of
                    the South Vietnamese army by the Vietnamese communists and at the same time a
                    reign of terror in an entire province south of Saigon. This was a quantum leap
                    in terms of the kind of violence that the communist had been engaged in, so I
                    have always stated that the beginning of the war was January, 1960.</p>
                <p>At the same time internal non-communist dissent with the way in which President
                    Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, his right hand man, handled the government
                    was increasing in Vietnam. These were our two great problems at that time and to
                    remain so for a number of years. In September 1960, the Embassy, partly as a
                    result of my pushing as political counselor, decided to try to put pressure on
                    President Diem to appease his non-communist opponents by bringing some other men
                    into the government and making some other changes and principally by getting rid
                    of his brother Nhu, who was the focal point of disagreement. Nhu and his wife,
                    Madame Nhu, were the two principal foci of the growing non-communist opposition
                    in the country.</p>
                <p>On Labor Day weekend, 1960, we drafted a message to Washington and got approval
                    of a demarche to Diem on this point. The demarche was actually made when Graham
                    Parsons, who was then the Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, was
                    visiting in Saigon. He and Ambassador Durbrow called on President Diem and the
                    demarche was made. Our principal recommendation was that Diem get rid of Nhu,
                    perhaps by sending him abroad as an ambassador—one of the classic devices for
                    getting rid of a man who is unpopular. The whole demarche fell completely flat.
                    Diem did nothing of what we recommended to him at that stage. Within two or
                    three weeks, the first military coup attempt to overthrow him took place. This
                    is what we were concerned about because we knew there was increasing
                    disillusionment and dissent within the armed forces. The Vietnamese military
                    were increasingly feeling that with the way in which Diem and Nhu ran the
                    government war could not be won against the communists. These were
                    non-communists, not communists at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I had been very much a pro-Diem man, even when we drafted these proposals to make
                    a demarche to him. I wanted to see him get rid of Nhu, but was in favor of
                    keeping Diem. But after that first coup attempt when Diem showed that he had
                    learned nothing—had made no changes whatsoever as a result of this first coup
                    which had come within an ace of succeeding—it became increasingly obvious to me
                    that Diem, himself, would have to go if we had any hope of winning the war.</p>
                <p>Now that, of course, was the beginning of the time of great disagreement within
                    the U.S. Mission about the U.S. policy towards Diem. Disagreement which came to
                    a head two years later, which I shall reach in a moment. The mission was split
                    right down the middle as was the U.S. government here in Washington over the
                    policy towards Diem. My own judgment was that the conflict could not be won
                    because of the utter disorganization of the way Diem and Nhu ran the
                    government.</p>
                <p>At the same time that this was going on the communist war in the field was
                    expanding and it was decided within our mission that we ought to draw up a
                    unified counter-insurgency plan and propose it to the South Vietnamese
                    government. A country team subcommittee was created with membership from the
                    Embassy; MAAG, which was a large military assistance mission; AID organization;
                    CIA and USIA—five agencies represented on it. I, as political counselor, was
                    chosen as the head of the team to draft the counter-insurgency plan. Much of the
                    work on it was done by my military colleagues on the committee, with whom I had
                    close and good personal working relations. After a couple of months we had the
                    plan completed and submitted it to Washington for approval. The first, as far as
                    I am aware, official act which John Kennedy as the new president in January
                    1961, took was to approve this plan personally, because we got a brief telegram
                    from Washington—”Plan approved at highest level.” That term was reserved for the
                    President.</p>
                <p>Then came the job of selling it to the South Vietnamese government. The
                    ambassador turned to me and said, “I want you to conduct a briefing and
                    negotiations with the number three man in the Vietnamese government.” The number
                    one being Diem and the number two being his brother Nhu, the number three being
                    a man by the name of Thuan, who had two hats—he was the Chief of Staff of the
                    Presidency and also the Secretary of Defense. So I spent a week doing that. I
                    had sessions every day with Thuan, accompanied by some of my military and other
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>Thuan was one of the ablest Vietnamese I ever encountered. A man whose subsequent
                    history was in a sense tragic. In 1963, he, like so many officials, finally
                    broke with Diem and Nhu, himself. I believe he had to flee across the Cambodian
                    border for his life. He escaped to Paris and never became involved again in
                    affairs in Vietnam. I thought he was a great loss to that country because he had
                    one of the best minds of anybody... And could organize and knew how to operate.
                    I had very high regard for him.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>After we concluded these sessions with Thuan, he had to present it to Diem. By
                    that stage relations between Diem and our ambassador Durbrow were at a low level
                    because Durbrow had on Washington's instructions, been pushing Diem on so many
                    things. Diem was not about to concede anything to Durbrow. It was also known
                    that Durbrow would soon be leaving on transfer and be replaced with another
                    ambassador. Diem held out until Durbrow actually left.</p>
                <p>Our DCM was on home leave and I, as political counselor, was Charg� for about
                    five days. I think within 24 hours after Durbrow's departure, Thuan telephone me
                    and said—by that time we had reduced the plan to two essential demands: 1) unity
                    of command in the armed forces (which seems to me absolutely essential in
                    conducting a war) and 2) a unified central intelligence organization. The
                    Vietnam government under Diem had neither. There was no central focus of command
                    in the military and there were all kinds of intelligence organizations. Thuan
                    said that President Diem had agreed to those two points. Well, I cabled it off
                    to Washington, but the sad upshot was that this proved, not to my surprise, to
                    be an agreement only on paper. Diem never did implement these recommendations.
                    He was so afraid of a military coup against him that he wanted to keep his own
                    military and intelligence divided. My answer to that was that by doing that and
                    thus failing to conduct the war against the communists effectively, you increase
                    rather than decrease the chances for a coup. But Diem didn't see it that
                    way.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I had been Charg� about 24 hours, I received a NIACT or FLASH
                    from Washington—”Lyndon Johnson, then Vice President, will be arriving within a
                    few days on an official visit. Please get the concurrence of the Vietnamese
                    government.” The message was brought to me while I was at the main hotel in
                    Saigon at a dinner the Vietnamese were giving for Senator Dodd from Connecticut.
                    He had arrived that day and they were giving him a dinner. I got the message, I
                    remember going out to the reception desk, and immediately telephoning Thuan. He
                    said, “I will ask President Diem in the morning.” I said, “Can you ask him
                    tonight?” “No,” he said, “I can't ask him tonight.” Knowing how Washington, and
                    particularly people like LBJ, could be impatient for immediate responses, and if
                    you don't get them the guy who is in charge on the American side suffers. I had
                    a rather sleepless night, but Thuan came through in the morning. I cabled it off
                    to Washington. Then there was much back and forth. Johnson wanted to stay in a
                    hotel and Diem wanted him to stay in the President Guest House. Diem finally won
                    on that one—Johnson did concede.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Our new ambassador arrived about 24 hours prior to Johnson—Frederick “Fritz”
                    Nolting. Nolting having had no experience in Southeast Asia before, let alone
                    Vietnam, obviously knew nothing about the situation, so he let me handle the
                    visit of the Vice President. I worked out all the scheduling with the Vietnamese
                    government, all the activities. I remember being in the Vietnamese Guest
                    House....this is something that I have always found remarkable, Tully. The first
                    night that Johnson was there—he was on a six nation tour, Vietnam was the second
                    stop. This was a man who six years earlier had had a severe heart attack when
                    majority leader in the Senate. He slept one hour of that first night. I was in
                    his room with Lady Bird Johnson sleeping in bed, Johnson on the telephone to
                    Washington at 2 and 3 am in the morning. He slept one hour and had four more
                    countries to go. Where that man got his energy I do not know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No politician could survive without it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I have always prided myself on having a considerable energy, but at
                    the end of that Vice Presidential visit I was more tired than I have ever been
                    in my life and I didn't have four more countries to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joe, you were just expressing your total exhaustion after
                        a Johnson visit, and I know what you are talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I may add one more thing in respect to that visit. Johnson was there
                    two nights and one full day and I remember on the afternoon of the full day the
                    Vietnamese general who was in charge of Johnson's security turned to me and
                    said, “Your Vice President has changed the itinerary so often during his time
                    here that I can't possibly keep up with him. I haven't the slightest idea where
                    he is going to be or what to do to protect him. I can only hope the communists
                    are just as confused as I am with all these changes he has made. That is his
                    only hope under the circumstances.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never traveled with Johnson, but I did once travel with
                        Nixon. Different personalities but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Johnson was not the easiest man. Lady Bird is a real lady. Johnson
                    was not an easy man at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw a good deal of him during the days I was on the
                        Hill.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: As I indicated, our new ambassador, Fritz Nolting, arrived just
                    before the Johnson visit. He came with instructions from President Kennedy to
                    get along with President Diem. Nolting very quickly became convinced 1000
                    percent of the rightness of these instructions and was a total pro-Diem man. By
                    that time I had reached the stage in my mind that Diem could not win the war
                    against the communists and therefore it no longer served our interests for him
                    to be in power. So there was this big disagreement between the ambassador and
                    me, as political counselor, and it was well known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Francis Cunningham who was later succeeded by Bill Trueheart.</p>
                <p>As a result of this disagreement, my influence and range of activities
                    considerably declined. I indicated that I had been very close to the number
                    three in the Vietnamese government, Mr. Thuan. He noticeably had cooled on me
                    because he knew I no longer had the influence with Nolting as ambassador as I
                    had when Durbrow was ambassador. A very interesting example of how power can wax
                    and wane. So during my last year in Saigon I was considerably less involved,
                    less prominent than I had been during the first two years.</p>
                <p>I think for the sake of new Foreign Service officers, or even present Foreign
                    Service officers in training, it is also interesting to recall some of my
                    experiences under Nolting. We as political officers had very little contact with
                    Vietnamese military officers even though we regarded them quite important in a
                    political sense, because we felt that it might well endanger them personally if
                    they were seen in contact with political officers. One night at a dinner party
                    given by the director of the AID mission at which General Big Minh, who was
                    prominent in Vietnamese history for 15 or 20 years, was present. I managed to
                    get myself seated at a table for four with him and talked to him in the indirect
                    fashion in which one always talked with Vietnamese about possible dissent with
                    the government. There was never a direct conversation. One had to conduct it
                    very carefully in terms of circumlocution, but if one had experience in dealing
                    with the Vietnamese one knew exactly what they were saying. Well, I had this
                    talk with Minh and it became clear as we had heard that Minh was becoming
                    increasingly disillusioned as far as the government was concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I went back to the Embassy the next morning and prepared a message on this. The
                    ambassador saw it, but he, like his predecessor, had always insisted that
                    everything going out be cleared by all agencies. He sent it over to the chief of
                    MAAG, a Lt. General, for clearance. The latter came back and said, “Minh had
                    never said anything to me like this, I don't believe it.” Well obviously he
                    wasn't going to say this to the chief of MAAG because he knew the chief of MAAG
                    was pro-Diem and any Vietnamese who valued his hide wouldn't talk like that to
                    anyone pro-Diem. Everyone's views at the American mission were known by the
                    Vietnamese—they knew whom to talk with and whom not to talk to. Subsequently the
                    chief of MAAG became as anti-Diem as I did, but at this time he was still very
                    much pro-Diem. As a result the ambassador canned my message. This was not the
                    time when dissent messages could get out.</p>
                <p>I also around the same time drafted an assessment on the so-called strategic
                    hamlet program. This was a program that was pushed by the British general who
                    had been prominent in the successful British anti-communist guerrilla campaign
                    in Malaya and who by then was in Vietnam advising the Vietnamese. It was
                    basically a good idea that was picked up by Ngo Dinh Nhu, the president's
                    brother, who ran with it and executed it in utterly the wrong way so that it was
                    not being effective. It was complete chaos. I drafted a frank assessment of how
                    this program was going based on the views I was getting from my Vietnamese
                    contacts. Since this disagreed with the assessment of the ambassador and the
                    chief of MAAG, that message got canned too. It didn't get out either.</p>
                <p>The other message of some significance which I did draft during that last year
                    was, I think probably the first one that dealt with bombing North Vietnam. I was
                    in favor of initiation of bombing for retaliatory reasons. I never see why your
                    enemy should get away with raining destruction on you unless you rain some on
                    him. I was not of the view that it would be decisive in any way, but I suggested
                    targets and so on. I think this was the first time, as least as far as the U.S.
                    Embassy was concerned, that any such message had gone out. Both the military and
                    the ambassador approved of it and it did get out.</p>
                <p>So after about a year of this my three year tour in Vietnam came to a close. In
                    the summer of 1962 I came back to Washington. I had a three year assignment
                    here. The first year I was a student at the National War College, which was just
                    what I wanted at this stage of my career. I enjoyed it very much, learned a
                    certain amount while I was there and always look back on that year with
                    considerable pleasure. I regard it as having been useful. My military
                    colleagues, who of course were getting increasingly interested in Vietnam, were
                    all fascinated with my experience there so I developed a very good rapport with
                    them at that stage and found it a very satisfying experience. The Department
                    deputy commandant at that point was Ambassador Winthrop Brown who had been our
                    ambassador in Laos and I had a good relationship with him as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I looked around, as one does at the War College, before the year was up for
                    assignments. I thought the next step in my career might be a small post DCM
                    position, but I did not find open any which I thought were sufficiently of
                    interest careerwise to make me want to pursue the possibility. I did get a
                    request to come over to the Bureau of International Organizations for an
                    interview as deputy director of the office of economic and social affairs—the
                    office in which I had rejected at a lower level job earlier. I went through the
                    interview and declined that job as it was not one that would interest me either
                    professionally or careerwise.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Roger Hilsman, who was then the Assistant Secretary for East Asian
                    Affairs, indicated that he wanted me to come back into that Bureau. First as the
                    so-called United Nations Advisor, which was a senior advisory slot, FSO-2 level,
                    which had been held for many years by a lady by the name of Ruth Baker who
                    executed Walter Robertson's anti-Communist China policy vis-a-vis the Bureau of
                    International Organizations. He said that this would be an interim assignment
                    because what the Department was planning to set up in many of the geographic
                    bureaus was an office of regional affairs which would absorb several adviser
                    posts that each bureau had maintained previously. He wanted me to be deputy
                    director of that office.</p>
                <p>So, I agreed to this assignment. I immediately found that virtually all I was
                    doing, though it was regional, was Vietnam affairs, as Hilsman, himself, was at
                    that stage. It was at that point that the only real footnote in history which I
                    will ever have occurred. President Kennedy fairly often sent out special
                    missions to Vietnam to assess the situation and report back to him. The
                    Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara, had gone out fairly often as well as other
                    members of the government. In early September, this was at the height of the
                    Buddhist crisis in Vietnam in September 1963, Kennedy had a meeting of the
                    National Security Council, or whatever he called the equivalent of it, dealing
                    with the crisis in Vietnam and decided that he would send General Krulak, a two
                    star Marine Corps general and known as the Brute because he was so small...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I knew him.</hi>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: ...out on a special assessment mission. Krulak was known to be a 100
                    percent pro-Diem and was very close to McNamara, Secretary of Defense; and
                    General Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At this NSC meeting
                    Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, probably at the prodding of Roger Hilsman,
                    suggested to President Kennedy that the State Department should also send a
                    representative. Hilsman, himself, was anti-Diem so he would have liked to get
                    somebody in to balance Krulak's view. After he got back he asked me if I would
                    be willing to go. I said, “Sure.” He called Dean Rusk who said, “Mendenhall's
                    anti-Diem views are so well known maybe we should try to get somebody else.”
                    Hilsman said, “I don't have anybody else. I still think we should send him.” And
                    Dean Rusk agreed. This was about 11 o'clock in the morning. Hilsman said to me,
                    “The helicopter is leaving the Pentagon for Andrews Field at 1 o'clock.” I said,
                    “Well, I need both money and to pack some clothes.” He said, “Well, I will call
                    your wife and tell her to go cash a check and get some money while you go home
                    to get some clothes.” This was probably the only time in history that an
                    Assistant Secretary called and told a wife of a Foreign Service officer to go
                    cash a check.</p>
                <p>I managed to reach the helipad at the Pentagon in time to get on the helicopter
                    with Brute Krulak. We went to Andrews Field, got in a plane and took off for
                    Okinawa. We arrived Saturday evening in Okinawa to be informed that there was a
                    curfew at the airport in Saigon. That we couldn't get in before 6 am. So we had
                    a few hours to kill in Okinawa. We went to the Saturday night dance at the
                    Officers Club and I tried to get a little sleep before we got on the airplane
                    again. We arrived in Saigon about 6 am.</p>
                <p>The first thing I did in Saigon was to get together with Henry Cabot Lodge, who
                    was the ambassador, who also knew my views—his and mine were pretty similar.
                    Krulak and I separated completely. Krulak, I knew, would have everything laid on
                    by all the resources of the military. He could get around the country anywhere
                    he wanted. The only thing the poor Embassy had was the Air Attach�'s aircraft
                    which was a slow moving propeller job. So Lodge arranged for me to have that
                    aircraft, which took four hours to fly up to Hue and Da Nang. I knew that Krulak
                    would come back here and say “Well, I have been in x many number of provinces. I
                    know the situation on the ground and the war is going excellently.” So I knew I
                    had to get out into the countryside in order to counter balance his view and I
                    got up to Hue and Da Nang. I stayed overnight and talked to people up there.
                    Came back to Saigon where I saw a few old Vietnamese friends whose judgment I
                    knew I could trust. At that time there was a virtual reign of terror in Saigon.
                    Bill Trueheart, the DCM, invited my old friend, the number two in the Foreign
                    Office, for lunch and told me it was even dangerous for him to come to a lunch
                    at an American Embassy official's house. The fact he is coming and is an old
                    friend and knows you indicates that he is willing to brave the situation even
                    though it is personally dangerous to him. The situation had deteriorated to that
                    extent in Saigon. Americans, including Trueheart, himself, were on an
                    assassination list—not of the communists, but of the Vietnamese government
                    because of the pressure we were putting on Diem and Nhu.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>I saw what the situation was both out in the field and in Saigon. Thirty-six
                    hours after we landed, Krulak and I were back on the airplane headed back to
                    Washington. We left Washington, Friday afternoon and were back here by Tuesday
                    morning at 6 am and by 10 am we were both in the Cabinet room at the White House
                    reporting to the President and the National Security Council. We gave very
                    diametrically opposite views on the situation in Vietnam politically and as far
                    as the war was going. When we finished, President Kennedy turned to each of us
                    and made that remark which has been so often reported, “You were both in the
                    same country weren't you?” This is what got into so many books—my small footnote
                    to history.Fortunately on the airplane we had brought back with us two officials
                    from the U.S. mission whose tours were up. One was the director of USIS, John
                    Mecklin, and the other was an AID official by the name of Rufus Phillips, who
                    had been running the AID program in the provinces. Both of them supported my
                    point of view at the meeting with the President. Phillips, in particular, lent
                    considerable credibility to my point of view because of the kind of assignment
                    he was on—he knew the area and the situation in the countryside very well. I
                    might say that at that meeting with Kennedy and his NSC, Fritz Nolting, who had
                    just been replaced as ambassador by Henry Cabot Lodge, was present. He
                    immediately tried to impugn my credibility before the President. The man who
                    sprang to my defense was no less than McGeorge Bundy, the National Security
                    Advisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you stood up under all this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: At that meeting, though, I learned subsequently, that I totally
                    alienated the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                    to the point that the next time I went to the White House for an NSC meeting on
                    Vietnam, I went with Alex Johnson, who said, “Don't open your mouth at this
                    meeting.” Alex was then responsible for liaison with the Department of Defense.
                    I now know he was getting this kind of line from McNamara and Maxwell
                    Taylor.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact this had repercussions on me and my assignment and career
                    later which I will get into in just a few minutes. One doesn't alienate some of
                    the great powers in Washington without consequences as you well know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to wait quite a while for a change in personnel.
                        By this time were you Chairman of the Vietnam Working Group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: No, not yet. I was still Deputy Director of Regional Affairs for the
                    Far East. The next event of significance in my job and career came at the end of
                    October, 1963. It was known in Washington on the basis of cable reporting that
                    there could be a military coup in Saigon. At that stage we were mounting a
                    24-hour watch in the Operations Center. I happened to be on all night duty the
                    night the coup took place. I saw the first messages that came in to the
                    Operations Center. As soon as I saw them I got on the telephone. I awakened the
                    Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, the Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara, and the
                    National Security Advisor, McGeorge Bundy. I asked if he wanted me to call the
                    President. He said, “I will take care of that.” They got their first word
                    through me of the fact that the coup was then in progress.</p>
                <p>Everybody, I think, knows the outcome of that coup. It was successful, but within
                    about 24 hours after the coup had ended, Diem and his brother Nhu were slain,
                    assassinated, by military officers. It was General Big Minh who took over the
                    government with two of his colleagues. Whether these assassinations were done
                    with his knowledge I really don't know. I for a long time thought it probably
                    was done by some military officer on the spur of the moment. But I have seen
                    books and articles which indicate that Minh was responsible for it. I just don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>That, of course, was a traumatic experience for the Administration because they
                    had no anticipation that Diem and Nhu would be assassinated. It was thought that
                    they would be exiled. If one wants to look at this in a realpolitik manner, it
                    probably from that standpoint was better in the end that they were eliminated.
                    This wouldn't be a very popular point of view to express in the United States at
                    all, but Diem and Nhu would have constantly plotted their return and added
                    enormous complications to the situation.</p>
                <p>Well, what happened in Vietnam after that unfortunately was a series of coups. We
                    had two years of political chaos which did nothing for Mendenhall's political
                    reputation because I had been in favor of replacement of Diem. But eventually
                    General Thieu took over the government in 1965. I believe, although one can make
                    a very good case that the coup against Diem was a disaster because of the
                    subsequent chaos, over the longer run it was the wiser thing because I think
                    Thieu governed Vietnam more effectively and with better organization than Diem
                    and Nhu did and certainly permitted closer collaboration with us Americans than
                    Diem and Nhu would have. It was through that kind of close, integrated,
                    cooperative Vietnamese-American effort that we finally succeeded in the
                    counter-insurgency pacification program. As I said I was responsible for the
                    first counter-insurgency plan which I know fell far short of the kind of effort
                    which after many years of experimentation we finally devised in Vietnam by 1967,
                    which succeeded in eventually winning the guerilla war in that country.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Now this is something I would like to stress. Many Americans, even many who were
                    for the war, do not understand what actually happened in Vietnam. We were losing
                    the guerilla war for a long time, but from 1967 on we and the South Vietnamese
                    organized ourselves properly to win that war which was won by 1970 or 71. South
                    Vietnam was eventually defeated not in the guerilla war but in a straight
                    conventional conflict after we had withdrawn our forces and the Congress had cut
                    back very greatly on the amount of aid going to Vietnam. As the general who led
                    the Vietnamese communist forces in the final great push which took central
                    Vietnam and eventually succeeded in taking Saigon said, “The South Vietnamese
                    wound up fighting a poor man's war. We were better equipped than they
                    were.”—because the Congress had cut back so much on military assistance to
                    Vietnam. For the sake of the United States in the future, we should understand
                    that we did win the guerilla conflict but we and the South Vietnamese lost the
                    one where we should have won, the conventional war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think a good deal of that is now coming out from others
                        too, as well as yourself. It will be a long time before we have this history
                        totally organized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Tully, I might go in to one other thing with respect to Vietnam
                    before I leave that subject—you can see it is one that interests me very
                    greatly. That is the upheaval within the Department over responsibility for
                    Vietnam. I think this is something that would interest Foreign Service
                    officers.</p>
                <p>I have indicated that Roger Hilsman who was the Assistant Secretary for Far
                    Eastern Affairs was also a man who thought that in the early stages of the war
                    the Department of Defense was not conducting our part of the war properly. That
                    we should be putting much more emphasis on anti-guerilla activities rather than
                    the conventional war at that stage. Hilsman was influenced by the fact that
                    during World War II he had worked in anti-guerilla units in Burma so his
                    personal experience had influenced him greatly. Hilsman made no bones either
                    within the government or talking with the press about how he thought the war
                    should be conducted. He and McNamara were totally at loggerheads. McNamara, of
                    course, being the more senior official, met along with the Secretary of State
                    and the National Security Advisor every Tuesday with the President at lunch to
                    talk about Vietnam. McNamara's attitude towards Hilsman was such that the
                    Secretary of State had to agree in February, 1964 to remove the responsibility
                    from Vietnam from Hilsman as Assistant Secretary, put it in a special unit
                    attached directly to the Secretary's office. I was not chosen to head that even
                    thought I was director of the Vietnam Working Group because it was also known
                    that my relations with McNamara were not good.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Bill Sullivan, who was then special assistant to Averell Harriman, the Under
                    Secretary, was chosen to head the unit. I was moved in under my good friend
                    Bill, and a lot of other officers from various Departments were added until we
                    had an integrated government-wide working group under Bill dealing with Vietnam.
                    It worked all right but there wasn't really enough for both Bill and me to do so
                    I decided that after a few months I ought to be looking for some other
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Hilsman had resigned because in addition to the blow of responsibility
                    for Vietnam being removed from him, there was a decision to send a special
                    emissary to Cambodia to deal with Sihanouk over the situation in Cambodia and
                    instead of Hilsman being chosen somebody else was and it was the last blow as
                    far as Hilsman was concerned. I don't think you find this in Hilsman's book as
                    the reason for his resignation, but these two things together I think are what
                    led to Hilsman's resignation.</p>
                <p>Hilsman was replaced by Bill Bundy, who had been the Assistant Secretary for
                    International Security Affairs in the Department of Defense. He was very close
                    to McNamara and obviously a man who could get along with McNamara when he came
                    to the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was, however, Mac Bundy who had defended you
                        before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Right, they were brothers.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Bill Bundy asked me whether I would come back into the Bureau of East Asian
                    Affairs to be the director of regional affairs. I had been deputy director. I
                    agreed to do it and served about a year in that capacity. I can't say that year
                    was one in which I did anything of very great significance. One thing I do
                    remember doing there was to send a memorandum to Bill Bundy in the summer of
                    '64, July, I think, when we got the first intelligence that North Vietnamese
                    military individuals and subsequently units were being infiltrated from North
                    Vietnam into South Vietnam. Prior to that time the North had always infiltrated
                    southerners who had been taken to the North in 1954 at the time of the division
                    of the country into the two zones—North and South. They had exhausted that
                    supply and were beginning to infiltrate northerners. That to me represented a
                    change in the nature of the war. The North Vietnamese had always tried to
                    portray that this was a civil war within South Vietnam of the southerners
                    against their government and they had had some success up to that point because
                    they had been using southern communists including those who had been taken north
                    in '54 and retrained and armed up there. Having exhausted that supply they began
                    to send in first individuals from the North Vietnamese armed forces and then
                    units. It is pretty easy for a Vietnamese to determine who is from the south and
                    who is from the north by accent. They know immediately where a Vietnamese comes
                    from. So on the basis of that I sent Bundy a memorandum recommending that what
                    we should do to win the conflict in my judgment was to send American military
                    forces to Vietnam. At that point Johnson had not made the decision to send
                    military units. We had a lot of American advisors, but no military units as
                    such. I suggested just off the top of my head about three divisions to establish
                    a barrier along the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam and all
                    the way across Laos to Savannakh�t on the Mekong River to cut off to the maximum
                    extent possible the infiltration of men and supplies from North Vietnam to South
                    Vietnam—the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Preventing the North from sending down
                    northerners I thought was increasingly important. I have remained of that
                    judgment ever since: that is, in terms of strategy we, the US, followed the
                    wrong one in trying to apply the attrition strategy which had been successful in
                    World War II in the Vietnam situation. What we were dealing with in the case of
                    Vietnam was what was in effect a sanctuary in North Vietnam. Certainly we bombed
                    them, but we had no intentions of sending ground forces in because of our
                    experience in Korea. So in effect the North Vietnamese had a sanctuary in North
                    Vietnam and in Laos. We bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail a lot, but you cannot
                    interdict by bombing alone. This may be relevant to Iraq today, I do not know.
                    You have to do it on the ground.</p>
                <p>So my strategy was to try to reduce to the maximum extent possible the constant
                    flow of replacements. With an attrition strategy you cannot hope to win it if
                    what you attrite is always being replaced by new men and new equipment and that
                    was what the North Vietnamese did since they were operating from what in effect
                    was essentially a sanctuary.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>So as early as '64 I recommended this as the strategy to be followed in the war.
                    Obviously we know that that strategy was never adopted by the United States.
                    There are books published since the war, including one by a four-star general,
                    Bruce Palmer, which indicates that he thinks this kind of strategy should have
                    been followed as well. We also have another Foreign Service officer who recently
                    published a book to this effect—Norman Hannah. His book is A Key To Failure, I
                    think. The South Vietnamese Chief of Staff, General Cao Van Vien, also
                    recommended this approach. But I don't think it was ever very seriously
                    considered within the United States government. It certainly was never adopted.
                    Maybe I should not say never taken seriously. I think at one point the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff even suggested this, but it was never adopted by McNamara or
                    President Johnson—the two men who in my mind are primarily responsible for the
                    outcome of the war in Vietnam for failing to adopt the proper strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: However, general American psychology in the long run is
                        what cost us the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, but if we had adopted this strategy, Tully, we wouldn't have
                    lost American public opinion. As General Palmer said, we would not have had to
                    put in nearly so many in the way of forces and our casualties would have been
                    substantially less. These were the two things that turned around the views of
                    the American public.</p>
                <p>Right at the moment we see this factor operating in the case of the war against
                    Iraq. The Administration is following the path of the air war as long as
                    possible because it keeps the casualties down and therefore they don't risk a
                    reversal of public opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, does this get you pretty much through...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Let me just say a couple of things. One of the interesting
                    experiences I had during that period was to attend a meeting at the Foreign
                    Minister level of the SEATO Council—the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization,
                    which never began to amount to the same thing that NATO did in Europe and was
                    eventually dissolved. But at that time there were annual meetings at the Foreign
                    Minister level and I attended one at which Mr. Bhutto, then the Foreign Minister
                    of Pakistan, subsequently the Prime Minister and President, was present. Bhutto,
                    though Pakistan was a member of SEATO, was as anti-American in the views that he
                    expressed at that council meeting as anybody I have ever seen. My view of him
                    was formed very much on the basis of how he conducted himself at that meeting.
                    Pakistan's foreign policy, of course, has always been guided in large measure by
                    its view towards India. In more recent years, Afghanistan has played a very
                    important role in determining Pakistan's foreign policy. But then at that time
                    Pakistan was being very cozy with Communist China and therefore Bhutto was very
                    anti-American. Subsequently, when he became Prime Minister some years later, I
                    think he modified those views and moved to a considerable degree towards a
                    pro-American position. I think his daughter now is quite pro-American I
                    understand.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The other thing of some interest which I did as director of regional affairs was
                    related to an Afro-Asian conference. We don't have these any longer today, but
                    in the 60s following the first Afro-Asian conference in Bandung, Indonesia, I
                    think in 1955, there was considerable interest in this. The second Afro-Asian
                    meeting was to be held in Algiers in April or May, 1965. Of course the U.S.
                    would not be attending such a meeting in any official capacity, but I was going
                    as a lobbyist to try to prevent whatever damage I could with respect to our
                    cause in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I had made a swing through the Far East prior to that time talking to friendly
                    governments, officials at foreign offices, about the meeting and urging
                    attendance and doing what we could to hold our position. We knew we would be
                    outvoted as there would be more radicals at that meeting than there would be
                    friendly countries. We were trying to follow a policy of damage limitation as
                    well as we could. I was on my way to the meeting and had arrived in Paris where
                    I had to pick up a plane to Algiers when word came through that there had been a
                    coup d'etat in Algeria and Ben Bella had been overthrown by Boumedienne.</p>
                <p>I thought since it looked like the Afro-Asian meeting was going to proceed that
                    the best thing was to go on down and adhere to our damage limitation policy. I
                    got on the telephone to the embassies in Paris of various Far Eastern countries
                    that I had visited to talk to them to urge them to proceed to attend. I was on
                    the telephone with the Thai embassy talking to an official when all of a sudden
                    the Thai Foreign Minister got on the other end, I had met him at the SEATO
                    council meeting earlier, and he talked to me directly about it. He said he was
                    uncertain whether to go and I urged him to go. He agreed to go. We all got down
                    there and I tried to stay in the background as much as possible because it would
                    have been counter productive to put myself forward as the American
                    representative, but we had these friendly countries who would be on the floor of
                    the conference and we would do what we could.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The afternoon for the opening of the meeting arrived. Bill Porter was our
                    ambassador in Algiers at that point. All the ambassadors were invited to the
                    opening ceremony and he said he would take me along to the opening. We arrived
                    at the door. The Algerian officials greeted him, he had credentials to get in,
                    and I started in but was told I was not permitted in. Porter turned to him and
                    said, “But he is my interpreter, I have to have him.” Well, Porter was one of
                    the best linguists in the Foreign Service. The Algerians said, “Oh, but Mr.
                    Ambassador you don't....” “Oh, yes I actually do...so you come with me.” So he
                    pulled me through and I went right through. The Algerians were looking sort of
                    agape at the way that he got me through. Out of sight of the officials he turned
                    to me and said, “Now you are on your own, I can't take you into the seat.” I
                    started down a corridor and another security official challenged me. I had no
                    credentials at all. He said I would have to get out of there. At that moment his
                    attention was diverted so I dived into a loge box and stayed there monitoring. I
                    was right in there where I could see everything. The meeting opened and within
                    five minutes was adjourned by the Algerians and never resumed. I have never
                    known exactly why the Algerians did that, but from our standpoint it was the
                    best outcome of the meeting, because we couldn't have won if the meeting had
                    proceeded. My friends from other embassies whom I had urged to attend were a
                    little annoyed. They felt their dignity had been compromised by this denouement.
                    No, they were not annoyed with me, they were annoyed with the Algerians. So it
                    turned out all right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Ambassador Joseph Mendenhall
                        continued after a three-day break at DACOR Bacon House on February 14, 1991.

                </p>
                <p>Ambassador Mendenhall, Joe, when we finished the other day you were just
                    describing your experiences at the Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers which lasted
                    five minutes, I think you said, but the work up to it was quite heavy. That was
                    part of your duties as Director of Regional Affairs in the FE Bureau. Was there
                    anything else that happened on that job you wish to relate?</p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I think we have covered the items.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then on to Laos. How did that assignment come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: This brings us to the summer of 1965 when my family decided after
                    three years in the States it wanted to taste something foreign so we decided to
                    take a brief summer vacation in the province of Quebec which is a bit different
                    from the Anglo-Saxon atmosphere. I had fully expected to serve another year in
                    Washington completing a four-year tour, but the day I arrived back from that
                    vacation, Bill Bundy, the Assistant Secretary for East Asian Affairs called me
                    in and said that Bill Sullivan, our ambassador to Laos, wanted me to come out to
                    Laos to operate the AID Mission for him. I asked Bill for 24 hours to speak to
                    my wife and think it over. Came back the next day and said, “Yes,” and within a
                    few weeks we were on our way out to Laos.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>That, indeed, proved to be the most interesting and challenging assignment of my
                    entire career. The mission in Laos was the second biggest in the world, after
                    Vietnam. We had about 500 Americans working for me in the AID Mission, 600
                    third-country nationals and 2,000 Lao employees. We were the largest employer of
                    labor in Laos after the Lao government. In financial terms our program was also
                    extremely large. We had a $50 million a year economic aid program and because of
                    provisions of the Geneva Accords of 1962, the economic aid mission also operated
                    the military aid program, which amounted to $150 million dollars a year. Those
                    two programs combined at $200 million a year would be about a billion dollars a
                    year in terms of dollars today.</p>
                <p>We had an extremely sizeable program. I had no idea when I went out there whether
                    I was a manager or not, one doesn't get too many opportunities in the Foreign
                    Service at a lower level to determine whether one has managerial capacity or
                    not. But I found that I did possess it. I ran that Mission and enjoyed it very
                    much for the three years I was there.</p>
                <p>The program which we operated was three-pronged. First we supported the war
                    effort. As you know, Tully, Laos was in many ways an integral part of the
                    conflict in Vietnam and in the AID Mission we functioned very closely with CIA
                    in support of the so-called secret war up in northeastern Laos against the North
                    Vietnamese communists and the Pathet Lao, the Lao communists, operating in that
                    area. We had a very large refugee program always numbering at least 100,000. As
                    soon as we would get some off the rolls by resettling them, additional ones
                    would be generated, so we constantly had about that number of refugees that we
                    were supporting around the provinces.</p>
                <p>The second prong of our program was the support of the economic stability of the
                    country of Lao. We did that by subsidizing certain essential imports for the
                    country and by operating a foreign exchange fund at a level which enabled the
                    Lao currency to be completely convertible. That is a pretty remarkable thing in
                    the case of a small underdeveloped country like Laos, but it did mean a very
                    substantial input of foreign assistance in order to keep the Lao currency, the
                    kip, convertible. There were five countries which participated in the foreign
                    exchange fund which supported the kip, but the United States, just as it is
                    today in the war in Iraq, was overwhelmingly the principal architect and
                    contributor to this program.</p>
                <p>The third prong of our AID program was economic development. It was one which had
                    not been emphasized very greatly before my arrival. I tried to put as much
                    emphasis on it as I could because I thought we ought to do whatever we could in
                    Laos in order to begin to move this country towards a self-sustaining basis.
                    Laos had imports of about $50 million and exports of about $1 million a year so
                    you can see that we had a long way to go if we were ever to achieve that
                    objective. The best one could hope for was to begin to whittle down this immense
                    deficit in the Lao balance of payments.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>As I wrote in one of the Congressional presentations in support of AID
                    appropriations in 1967, we really were trying to move Laos from the 12th century
                    to the 19th century, not into the 20th century. Laos was essentially still very
                    much a feudal country; very much underdeveloped. When the French were in control
                    of Indochina they did a certain amount in Vietnam and a lesser amount in
                    Cambodia and did virtually nothing to develop Laos, except for the construction
                    of a few roads, which by the time I was there had almost totally disintegrated.
                    In fact some of them had completely reverted to jungle—utterly impassible.</p>
                <p>As far as roads were concerned in our program and to indicate that we were not
                    trying to move into the 20th century, we never paved roads when we upgraded
                    them. We stabilized them in a way that we hoped would hold up during the
                    torrential monsoon rains, but they were not something on which we spent a lot of
                    money because the amount of traffic in Laos would not have required it at
                    all.</p>
                <p>We also in our economic development activities did our best to try to put Laos
                    back on a self-supporting basis as far as rice production was concerned. Rice is
                    the staple food in Laos. The country at one time had been completely
                    self-supporting, at a rather low level, but nonetheless self-supporting. I felt
                    what we should try to do was to increase the production of rice and get them
                    back up as nearly as we could to sustaining themselves. One of the problems was
                    that so many of the Lao males had been taken off for military operations that
                    there were not very many people left on the farms to operate them except for
                    women. Actually in rice culture women can do everything except to plow with
                    water buffaloes. You usually need a male to do that, but all the rest of the
                    work they could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this a cultural thing or a physical thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: A physical thing. Even though the water buffalo is a docile animal it
                    is too difficult for a woman to handle along with a plow which they are holding
                    on to.</p>
                <p>This was the time when the so-called new miracle rice was being developed in the
                    Philippines at an experimental station. This is something that spread throughout
                    much of Asia subsequently. We introduced it into Laos at that time. We also
                    began to encourage the farmers to use fertilizer and insecticides. We developed
                    small irrigation projects, and I do mean small. These often were little
                    self-help dams built on streams. We would furnish the materials and the peasants
                    would supply the labor to build these little dams. We also encouraged the Lao to
                    go in to some extent for double cropping. During the dry season, traditionally
                    it was impossible to put into the ground a second crop of rice, but with
                    irrigation it was possible to begin to develop a certain amount of second
                    cropping.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>This program which I spent a great deal of time on was beginning to show some
                    signs of progress by the time I left—not great, but we were moving towards our
                    objective. I don't know what happened later. I am sure after the communists took
                    over in 1975 everything went to pot, but we did what we could during the time we
                    were there.</p>
                <p>It was interesting that in operating the AID program in Laos, the AID Mission
                    director there probably had as much if not more power than an AID Mission
                    director anywhere else in the world and in some respects even than in Vietnam at
                    that stage. I worked with all of the Ministers of the Lao government except the
                    Minister of Religious Affairs, which was a bit outside my domain. I found it
                    necessary since the Lao were not particularly energetic even at the ministerial
                    level, to have our mission prepare a proposed program each year in each of the
                    functional fields—education, health, public works, etc. Then we would take this
                    program and I would sit down with the minister who was the head of that
                    department, discuss it with him and get his concurrence. Sometimes he had a few
                    suggestions, but by and large they left it up to the AID Mission to work out the
                    program. It meant a constant series of negotiations all conducted in French—so
                    as a result of that my French came out of Laos far better than it had ever been
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a Laotian accent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Actually the Lao spoke very good French because a lot of the older
                    ones had been educated in the French educational system. They used to criticize
                    my accent. There was no university in Lao and one had to use French because
                    there was only one Lao who had been to an American university. A young man who
                    was very capable and worked in one of the ministries with us. One absolutely had
                    to speak French, there was no English in Laos.</p>
                <p>When I served in Vietnam a few years earlier, the Vietnamese had been
                    predominantly French speakers, but I think by the time I served in Laos, the
                    Americans were so ubiquitous in Vietnam that by that time a lot of Vietnamese
                    were speaking English. But that was not true of Laos at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>To indicate the extent of the AID Mission's activity in that country, in 1966,
                    when one of the great floods of the Mekong occurred and the capital city of
                    Vientiane was under about a meter of water for almost three weeks, it and the
                    surrounding area, the operations of the Lao government totally fell apart. We in
                    the AID Mission did everything to operate the services of that government. We
                    fed the city. We had rice for our refugee program and were able to use it to
                    feed the people of Vientiane. I decided that on that score since these people
                    were not destitute, we did not need to give away the rice as we did to the
                    refugees, that we would sell it to them. So we set up distribution points around
                    the city and sold rice every day to the people. At the end of the day, because
                    in Lao currency there was no bank note larger than the equivalent of $2 my staff
                    would come back with many, many burlap bags full of Lao kip, because they had
                    sold many tons of rice during the day at these distribution points. We also
                    brought in water purification systems from the American military because the
                    water was contaminated in the city. We vaccinated about 80,000 people which was
                    about two thirds of the total population of Vientiane. We even set up a boat
                    transportation system because there were some high points in the city that were
                    not under water but to get from one to another one had to have little boats. We
                    even operated the boat system to get people around. So in effect we operated
                    that city completely for about three weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of this organization to do all this was existing
                        when you went there or was there nothing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: No, no, the organization was in place when I arrived. I did not have
                    to set up the organization.</p>
                <p>It was fortunate that I did take the decision on my own to sell the rice to the
                    population of the city, because after the flood was over the Lao government
                    turned to me and said, “Look, to the extent that our streets were paved here in
                    the city they have totally disintegrated as a result of the flood. Will you
                    repave my streets?” Well, I took the $20,000 which we had gotten for the sale of
                    rice and used that to pave the streets.</p>
                <p>Now there is an interesting parallel to that. Oliver North took the money from
                    the sale of arms to Iran to support the Contras in Nicaragua and has been
                    subjected to all kinds of criticism for it. I suppose in a sense I did the same
                    thing because I didn't turn that $20,000 back into the treasury but used it for
                    a good purpose in Laos. We would have had to come through with the money anyway,
                    we just avoided a lot of bureaucracy by doing this.</p>
                <p>This is an example of the kind of power and authority which the AID Mission
                    director in Laos either possessed or took.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Another example of this was that within our mission we possessed a complete
                    construction capability. I don't think even the AID Mission in Vietnam had that
                    item. When they decided on a project they always had to contract with an outside
                    contractor. We had this right within our mission operated by an old American
                    construction man. As a matter of fact the first decision I ever took with
                    respect to the AID Mission Laos was here in Washington before I even got there.
                    This particular man was without an engineering degree and I found right after I
                    had been nominated as AID Mission director that the public works people in AID
                    Washington wanted to replace him with a man with an engineering degree. I had
                    been told that he had been doing a good job. He was here in Washington worrying
                    about his future and came up to me and laid out his case. I said, “Well, I
                    understand you are doing a good job. If you continue to I am going to support
                    and keep you.” I overruled the public works people here in AID and indeed he
                    proved a superbly efficient individual, degree or no degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Self taught contractor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: He was self taught. In Laos in the AID Mission we possessed the
                    authority to initiate and approve construction projects ourselves. In the
                    Marshall Plan days I know that didn't exist in any aid mission. I am not sure it
                    existed in Vietnam. All I had to do was to pick up a telephone and tell Tom
                    Cole, who headed the public works division, that I wanted him to build a road
                    here or an airport there, and he would do it.</p>
                <p>Again an example, in the great flood of 1966, which I mentioned a moment ago, the
                    chief airport up in northwestern Laos at Ban Houei Sai used for both civilian
                    and military purposes, was swept away by the flood. It was very essential, for
                    military as well as other reasons, to get another airport up there. So as soon
                    as the flood subsided, I got hold of Cole and said, “You go up there and have
                    your people build an airport.” In six weeks we had a new airport ready up there
                    capable of taking jets. It wasn't paved, but the reason it could take jets was
                    because right in the middle of the runway there was a slope down and because of
                    that slope you could get enough runway for a jet to take off. He did this in six
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>Another example, we have no road at all to northeastern Laos where so many of our
                    activities together with those of the CIA took place. Everything that went to
                    northeastern Laos had to go in by air which was extremely expensive. So I
                    decided that we ought to try to build a road up there. I had to go to get
                    approval from the Prime Minister because a road into the northeast for us to get
                    things in could enable the communists if they conducted an offensive to come
                    down that road. He agreed. What Tom Cole did was to simply take an airplane, fly
                    over the jungle and try to select his road route from the air. It was all jungle
                    and mountainous terrain all the way—about 40 or 50 miles. By the time I left he
                    had the project underway and I think it did get completed subsequently.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>But here again was a project which we undertook totally on our own in Laos
                    without any reference to Washington for approval or consent. I think this
                    authority that didn't exist anywhere else was one of the things that made the
                    job so fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this keep on as far as you know as long as we were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I would assume so, I think so.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that we had to fly everything up into northeastern Laos. I found when
                    I arrived in Laos in 1965 that one fifth of our total economic aid budget of $50
                    million a year was going to pay for air costs simply to move people and things
                    around the country by air. About $9 million of $50 million was going for that
                    purpose. I was appalled by that, to think that we were spending so much of our
                    aid money simply for air transportation. I decided that one of the first things
                    I was going to do was to try to get that down. Well in my three years there we
                    did succeed in cutting those air costs in half. We got them down from nine to
                    about four and a half million by instituting rigid controls over the use of
                    aircraft for the movement of people and things. Prior to that time anybody who
                    had a thought ran out to get a plane or helicopter. We had 20 helicopters and 40
                    fixed-wing aircraft under contract to the AID Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Air America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: This was Air America and Continental Airlines. That's an interesting
                    story. I found when I got there that the AID Mission had contracted with
                    Continental for 2 C-130 transport planes. These are very big planes and I found
                    there were only two airports in Laos capable of accommodating those planes. We
                    were paying $1000 an hour for operating them and were responsible to Continental
                    for a fixed number of hours per month whether we used them or not. This
                    immediately rang bells in my mind as to whether this was justified. I found
                    after a month that it was not at all justified so we told Continental, we had
                    the option after a month of saying take them back, to take them back.
                    Continental had purchased those planes specifically for the operation of Laos
                    not expecting this outcome. This didn't make me very popular with Continental
                    Airlines. Indeed, I found in subsequent negotiations over reducing air costs
                    that the man Continental sent out to supervise these negotiations wouldn't even
                    talk to me—that happened to be Pierre Salinger who had been the press spokesman
                    for President Kennedy, subsequently he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in
                    California and was then a Vice President of Continental. On his first visit he
                    was very cordial, but on his second visit when he saw how we were squeezing down
                    what we were paying to Continental he was so annoyed with me he wouldn't even
                    come around and talk with me at all. I fortunately had an excellent man in my
                    controller who conducted the negotiations with Continental and got our costs
                    very substantially reduced with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>This, Tully, was actually one of several fights that I had while AID Director in
                    Laos in order to reduce costs that I didn't feel were justified. I had one
                    battle with our CIA station chief over war operations. I was all in favor of
                    what CIA was doing so long as it seemed to me to serve a specific purpose. But
                    to conduct an operation for the sake of an operation didn't seem to me to be
                    justified, particularly when it always generated additional refugees for the AID
                    Mission to support.</p>
                <p>One operation I remember that I objected to after it took place because I hadn't
                    known about it before hand, was one up in northwestern Laos, up near the Chinese
                    frontier which generated a certain number of refugees for us to support. This
                    annoyed me and I also felt that it was not particularly wise politically to
                    conduct operations so close to the Chinese border because it risked a reaction
                    from the Communist Chinese regime.</p>
                <p>But that was a minor thing compared with another battle I had with him with
                    respect to northeastern Laos. In that area every year during the wet season the
                    Meo guerilla forces, the ones supported by CIA and the Aid Mission, would
                    conduct operations against the communists and make substantial advances. Then
                    would come the dry season when the communists would mount their offensive
                    against them and recover a good deal of that territory. The third year I was
                    there, General Vang Pao, the very capable Meo general who was in charge up there
                    told my man up in northeastern Laos that because of the heavy casualties which
                    the Meo had been taking in these campaigns and the fact that it had been simply
                    back and forth that he was not particularly in favor of an offensive the third
                    year. Well, in a country team meeting, the CIA station chief said he was not
                    getting that kind of report from his man up in northeastern Laos. He said that
                    Vang Pao was all gung-ho to carry on as they had done in preceding years. So we
                    had a big go round over that. The Ambassador decided to send us all up with the
                    DCM to talk directly with Vang Pao. Well, this unfortunately put Vang Pao on the
                    spot because he was drawing support from both CIA and AID and he didn't want to
                    alienate either. So all he did was temporize, but the result was that the
                    offensive that was carried on was substantially reduced in size.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Bob Hurwitch at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I would like to mention something about the AID representative up in northeastern
                    Laos. He was a very unique individual. He was an old Indiana dirt farmer who had
                    lost his wife and in his early 50s decided that he would leave his farm and join
                    the International Voluntary Service which was a private equivalent of the Peace
                    Corps. He was sent off to Laos to work up in northeastern Laos and learned Meo.
                    He was so successful in his liaison with the Meo that after a year or so with
                    IVS he was taken on by AID as our representative up there. He was a completely
                    uneducated man who had no idea of what English grammar was at all. As a matter
                    of fact one summer my oldest daughter went up to serve as his secretary for a
                    week. I told her to clean up the grammar before she sent his reports down to the
                    Mission. He was one of the most remarkably effective individuals in working with
                    backward peoples that I ever encountered in my life. Truly fantastic. He stayed
                    in Laos quite a number of years. He died shortly after Laos fell to the
                    communists. A very interesting fellow known as Pop Buell. There were a lot of
                    newspaper articles on him at the time he was serving there because he was such a
                    colorful individual.</p>
                <p>I also had a big battle with Embassy Bangkok over the cost of transportation
                    through Thailand. Everything that came into Laos had to be transported by land
                    up through Thailand. There was a Thai government organization with participation
                    by several Thai generals which operated the outfit that controlled the
                    transportation and they were gouging us as far as costs were concerned. So I
                    started putting up a big battle about that and generated a terrific reaction
                    against me, not the Thai, on the part of the Embassy in Bangkok. Graham Martin
                    was then the ambassador, but it was his economic minister who came down very
                    virulently against me on this and even started accusing me of shenanigans upon
                    which Bill Sullivan, our ambassador, rose in my defense and cables were flying
                    hot and heavy between Bangkok and Vientiane. The upshot of that was that we did
                    get some reduction in costs, not as much as we should have, but there was at
                    least partial success in that battle.</p>
                <p>Then I had another battle, this time with the Philippines. The AID Mission in
                    Laos spent about a $1 million a year financing a contract with a Filipino
                    organization known as Operation Brotherhood which manned several provincial
                    hospitals we had built in Laos. About $200,000 of that $1 million went towards
                    overhead in Manila and that raised a red flag in my mind. The main justification
                    that was being used was training personnel to come to man these hospitals in
                    Laos. Well, the Filipinos who were delighted to have a job in Laos seldom turned
                    over so there wasn't much continued training involved, so I couldn't see why we
                    needed to continue to send $200,000 out of our program to Manila. I think it was
                    being used mainly to support the sanctimonious head of Operation Brotherhood who
                    as soon as I started raising questions came over first to talk to me and then to
                    threaten me that he was going to take this matter to the President of the
                    Philippines with whom he was very close politically if I didn't back down. Well
                    I didn't back down. He went back to Manila and the next person who came over was
                    a personal emissary from the President of the Philippines. I talked to him,
                    explained the situation to him and he evidently accepted it and convinced the
                    President to accept it because my position totally prevailed in that fight.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I did learn, however, that the White House staff who were dealing with the war in
                    Vietnam were getting very concerned over the cables flying back and forth
                    between Vientiane and Manila because they were afraid my effort to cut down on
                    this money going to the Philippines might adversely affect Filipino
                    participation in the war in Vietnam. You never know what repercussions you stir
                    up in a battle of this sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is good to know somebody at the working level in the
                        White House was screening the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Another battle I had was an interesting one. In early 1968, the
                    American Mission, that is the embassy, CIA, USIA, AID and Defense, were
                    considering an increase in the salaries of the local Lao employees. I was very
                    strongly opposed to it for this reason. We were by far the biggest employer of
                    Lao labor among the agencies of the US Mission. I felt that if we agreed to an
                    increase in salaries of local employees, it would induce the Lao government to
                    raise salaries of their employees. Since anything they spent in their budget had
                    an immediate impact on the money we had to contribute to the foreign exchange
                    fund, I was opposed. The word got out to the Lao community that Mendenhall was
                    the only American head of an agency who was opposed to the increase. While I was
                    on a mission to southern Laos, an inspection mission, I learned my Lao employees
                    had gone on strike. This was the first labor strike in the history of Laos. I
                    came back and talked with the strike leaders, but they were persistent.
                    Everybody else, including the ambassador, wanted to go ahead with this increase
                    in the salaries, but I held out. There was a procedure in the regulations that
                    if the ambassador and a head of one of the other US missions disagreed, the
                    dispute could be submitted to Washington for decision. So Bill Sullivan and I
                    both sent off our positions by cable to Washington. Bill Gaud who was then the
                    head of AID went over and took it up with the number two man in the State
                    Department, the Deputy Secretary, Katzenbach. Katzenbach listened to him and
                    said, “You tell Mendenhall I admire his guts but we have enough problems in
                    Southeast Asia at this moment and I think we had better give in on this one.”
                    This was the moment of the heavy communist TET offensive in Vietnam. So at least
                    I got my case considered at top level here in Washington, but did not prevail in
                    that. And I might say that the fact that I disagreed with Sullivan over this
                    never affected our relations whatsoever. I give credit to Bill for that because
                    some ambassadors would have held this against another head of US mission for
                    insisting that this thing be taken to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This time you were not really on the Embassy staff. You
                        were an independent mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Well, I also concurrently held the role of economic counselor, but
                    that amounted to nothing. The AID Mission job in Laos was a big job, the
                    economic counselor was zero.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>My final big battle in Laos was with the Lao government itself. In the early
                    spring of 1968 one of the principal taxes collected by the Lao government—the
                    bottom fell out of it. Laos was an entrepot for the gold trade. It allowed gold
                    to be imported and exported freely, but taxed the exports. At that time the U.S.
                    rigidly controlled gold here and held the price at $35 an ounce. The U.S.
                    decided in the spring of 1968 to free the price of gold for commercial purposes.
                    Well this cut the ground out from under this Lao entrepot trade and took away
                    one of the principal sources of revenue for the government.</p>
                <p>I felt that the Lao government would then come down on us for increased
                    contributions for the foreign exchange fund because the budgetary deficit would
                    be much bigger and would therefore generate more demand for foreign exchange. I
                    insisted that they not only control their budget but reduce their budget
                    eventually in order to prevent this. Well, this resulted in a big conflict
                    between the Lao government and myself.</p>
                <p>At one stage a mission from the International Monetary Fund came out to Laos to
                    look over the situation. And though you know that IMF is supposed to be the bad
                    boy in financial situations like this, since there were no IMF funds at stake in
                    Laos, they weren't about to be the bad boy. I was the one. So at a big session
                    in the Prime Minister's office with the IMF team, the ambassadors of all the
                    other countries contributing to the foreign exchange fund and our Charg� Bob
                    Hurwitch, Bill Sullivan was on home leave at that point, and myself were
                    present. I was the only one who spoke up for stern controls. This alienated the
                    Prime Minister, Souvanna Phouma.</p>
                <p>I went off on home leave shortly after almost three years in Laos and to my
                    consternation while I was here a cable came through from Hurwitch that the Prime
                    Minister had asked that I not return to Laos. So in effect I was PNGed from Laos
                    after three years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably time to go anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Had Bill Sullivan been there this would never have gotten into the
                    Washington channels. It would have been resolved in Laos, it wouldn't have been
                    any problem. But our DCM, serving as Charg�, was rather jealous of my position
                    in the US community there and with the Lao and therefore put up no fight at all
                    with Souvanna Phouma when he asked that I not return.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The epilogue to this was that when Sullivan got back he did insist that I return
                    to Laos for a proper farewell reception. He gave the reception for me to which
                    all the Ministers of the Lao government except the Prime Minister came, which
                    gave me a good send off despite the fact that I had been PNGed. Thus endeth my
                    three year assignment to Laos which, in spite of what happened in the end, I
                    still regard as the most fascinating and challenging assignment of my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it certainly should have equipped you to run any
                        large corporation in the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Then I came back to Washington and though I had not been very well
                    supported by the Bureau for Far Eastern Affairs, AID fought for me as much as it
                    could. AID asked me to stay on in their organization as the number two man in
                    the Vietnam bureau. In 1967 Lyndon Johnson had insisted that the Vietnam
                    operation in AID be set up as a completely separate bureau equivalent to a
                    continent, equivalent to Asia, Africa, etc. That bureau had rapidly expanded
                    under a very able man, Jim Grant, and had between 400 and 500 employees here in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in the summer of 1968, Lyndon Johnson who had been the instigator
                    of that bureau was on the way out of his presidency, so Bill Gaud, the head of
                    AID, said, “What I want you to concentrate on is cutting the staff of that
                    bureau down substantially. In the course of the year and a half I was with the
                    bureau I succeeded in cutting it in half. That doesn't render one very popular
                    as you well know, Tully, and it wasn't a very easy thing to do because personnel
                    who were about to lose jobs were inclined to get hold of their Congressman and
                    one is involved in a lot of correspondence and discussion with members of
                    Congress over personnel matters. But we did get it cut in half and I was rather
                    gratified by it.</p>
                <p>After I had been in the bureau for half a year, Jim Grant, the Assistant
                    Administrator, the head of it, decided to leave the government and go to an
                    important private job and I became his successor as head of the bureau for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting year. You are an old Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Congressional relations and one of the few Foreign Service officers I imagine
                    who ever had extensive contact with Congress. My understanding is that besides
                    the Bureau of Congressional Relations and those in the Management Bureau who
                    deal with the budget of the Congress, the normal Foreign Service officer in the
                    Department, even Assistant Secretaries, don't have all that much contact with
                    members of Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some, particularly in the Economic Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: In AID, on the other hand, one is in touch with Congress almost all
                    the time because the key principal function of the AID Bureau is to get money
                    out of Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I remember you had a delightful Congressman to deal
                        with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: We did indeed. As a matter of fact the worst afternoon I think I ever
                    passed in my life was with Congressman Passman of Louisiana who was the chairman
                    of the House Appropriations Subcommittee dealing with AID appropriation. Passman
                    had been in that chairmanship for about 15 years and knew his way around very
                    extensively. But he had the habit of subjecting the AID people who came up to
                    defend the appropriations request to a third degree harassment with a whole
                    series of minor questions which they couldn't fairly be expected to know the
                    answers to and then trying to ridicule them. He had a staff member who sat
                    beside him and whispered the questions in his ear during the whole process of
                    the hearing. I was up there for the AID appropriations for that year and was on
                    the stand for four hours continuously. At the end of that time I don't think I
                    have ever been so tired in my life. I think I didn't let slip one unguarded
                    answer toward the end on which he pounced to try to show that our AID
                    appropriation at the level we were requesting was not justified. I don't know
                    how much you dealt with Passman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw him but I never faced him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: It was the AID people...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a Congressman from Maryland who was a problem
                        too about that time as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: No, I didn't...Oh, yes, I remember there was one—Long. He became
                    chairman later. Passman finally got his comeuppance. He was put on trial for
                    something in respect to Korea, I can't remember it now, but that ended his
                    political career. I don't even remember what the outcome of the trial was, but
                    it ended a long congressional career.</p>
                <p>The other man who gave me a certain amount of grief was also from Louisiana and
                    that was Senator Ellender, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I
                    remember he harassed me at one point during an open, public hearing to the point
                    where my middle daughter, then about 14 or 15 and sitting in the audience, got
                    up and shook her fists at Senator Ellender saying, “You can't treat my daddy
                    this way.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 3 continuing an interview on February 14,
                        1991 with Ambassador Joseph Mendenhall. When that other tape ended you were
                        relating some of your encounters with Senator Ellender and Congressman
                        Passman in defending the AID program. Would you like to proceed from
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes I would like to talk a bit about an interesting encounter with
                    Senator Packwood from Oregon who was then a freshman Senator and is now the
                    ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. In 1968, Jim Grant, the
                    Assistant Administrator of the Vietnam Bureau, before he left had driven through
                    the U.S. government a policy decision in favor of the initiation of a drastic
                    land reform program in South Vietnam. He even insisted in getting the signature
                    on the cable of Henry Kissinger who was then the National Security Advisor.
                    Everybody approved and that became the official policy of the U.S.
                    government.</p>
                <p>I was all in favor of it. I did think it was important that farmers buy the land
                    and not be given it on a grant basis because my experience in Laos was that when
                    we in the Aid Mission did anything completely on a grant basis for rural
                    villagers they regarded it as “the American project” and not theirs and if the
                    communists came along wouldn't raise a hand in defense of it. On the other hand,
                    if one involved the villagers, say in the construction of the school they
                    provided all the labor on a self-help basis and we provided the materials, they
                    had a real interest in that school because they had put something into it and
                    would defend it against the communists.</p>
                <p>So I felt that in South Vietnam it was important for the farmers to have a
                    personal stake in the land reform program by having paid at least something for
                    the land they got.</p>
                <p>This position that I held became known fairly widely in the government when I
                    became the head of the Vietnam Bureau in 1969 and one good day Senator Packwood
                    summoned the AID Administrator and myself to his office on the Hill and read the
                    riot act to us as though I was completely opposed to the land reform program. I
                    endeavored to explain my position but it is sometimes a little difficult to get
                    some things across when a preconceived idea gets into the head of a man up on
                    the Hill. Packwood had by his side a professor from the State of Washington who
                    was known as a man who thought that the total key to victory in South Vietnam
                    and the war was land reform. Nothing else mattered. Land reform would give us
                    the victory. He was the man who was feeding ideas into Packwood's head.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Later the chief Agricultural Credit official from South Vietnam came to
                    Washington on a visit and I arranged for a luncheon on the eighth floor of the
                    State Department for him and invited Senator Packwood to attend the luncheon. I
                    thought I would try to demonstrate to him that my heart was in the right place;
                    that I was supporting agricultural development in every way possible in South
                    Vietnam. Unfortunately during this luncheon it became clear that the Vietnamese
                    director of agricultural credit was not particularly in favor of the land reform
                    program. So this whole effort of mine boomeranged with Packwood. I came out
                    worse than I was before I went in as far as he was concerned.</p>
                <p>Later the professor from the State of Washington who had been with Packwood when
                    the AID Administrator and I had been in his office and subjected to his third
                    degree, published an article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer which was front
                    page banner headline attacking me personally for opposition to the land reform
                    program in Vietnam. When this was brought to my attention I sent out a letter in
                    response to the article. The newspaper did indeed publish the letter which
                    explained my position but then published a retort of the professor's side by
                    side, which further confirmed that in a battle with the press you can never
                    really win because they always have the last word, simply because of the nature
                    of the media.</p>
                <p>Another congressional experience which I think may be worth recording was one
                    with Senator Ted Kennedy who was the Chairman of the Refugee Subcommittee of the
                    Judiciary Committee. Kennedy had manifested very great interest in the refugee
                    program in Vietnam, much of it I think for his own political reasons. He decided
                    in March, 1969 that he would conduct public hearings on that program. The AID
                    Administrator and I were summoned up to testify. To open the hearings, somewhat
                    to my surprise and annoyance, Senator Kennedy read out the conclusions of the
                    hearings before they actually opened. Why? Because the press was there for the
                    opening of the hearings and would not be there later during the continued
                    sessions. So his conclusions had already been given to the public before he even
                    listened to us. That has, I think, rather influenced my views of Senator Kennedy
                    over the years.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The other man with whom I had a certain amount of experience over the years is
                    one whom I know you have a different regard for from mine, Tully. That is
                    Senator Claiborne Pell. I met Senator Pell in the summer of 1968 over dinner at
                    a club here in Washington and at that dinner he and I got involved in a rather
                    heated exchange over the war in Vietnam. He was a dove and I was a hawk. I
                    didn't think much more about that until I learned toward the end of 1969 that
                    Pell had made it clear to Bill Macomber, the Under Secretary for Management in
                    the Department, that he would oppose me for nomination to any significant
                    position in East Asia or indeed elsewhere if it involved anything of any
                    importance. And that explained to me why the year I was head of the Vietnam
                    Bureau in AID I was always Acting and never named officially and my name
                    submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I had never thought very
                    much about it. I had as full authority Acting as I would have had with Senate
                    confirmation and I had developed excellent rapport with AID people—indeed when I
                    left at the end of that year I was given a very find sendoff from the AID
                    Administrator and my colleagues as Assistant Administrators. But that did
                    explain why I had never been formally nominated and confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He must have learned all that from Fulbright who used
                        those tactics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: To me, Pell is a reverse McCarthyite, the way he pursued me, the way
                    Javert pursued Jean Valjean in “Les Miserables.”</p>
                <p>At the end of 1969 the Administration decided to nominate a Republican as the
                    Assistant Administrator for Vietnam. I decided it was time anyway for me to come
                    back to the Department. I had been four and a half years on loan to AID which
                    was, from a career standpoint, long enough. I enjoyed it, learned a great deal
                    and look back upon it as one of the highlights of my career. The Inspector
                    General, Fraser Wilkins, asked me whether I would take on an inspection job and
                    I agreed to do so. Interestingly, I indicated some interest in going to
                    Italy—there was to be an inspection in Italy in early 1970. When Fraser got the
                    assignments worked out whom do you think he called to say that he was giving us
                    Italy—not me, but my wife. He knew that my wife was especially interested in
                    going to Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sound just like Fraser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: You know what the consequences of that were, Tully. I never had an
                    assignment to Italy during my career except for this inspection one. Indeed
                    before going on this inspection I had spent only one night in Italy in my life,
                    catching a ship in Genoa when I left Switzerland in 1955. But as a result of
                    those two months of inspection, first in Trieste, Milano, Firenze and finally in
                    Roma, my good wife fell head over heels in love with Tuscany; would not rest
                    until we bought a piece of land and she stayed there later a year by herself to
                    supervise the construction of a house. I was living in your house in the
                    meantime.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe we charged you rent because...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Oh, I insisted upon that.</p>
                <p>She learned her Italian by being on the spot every day with the workmen and by
                    the summer of 1972 we had a house there. As you well know, we ultimately retired
                    there and have been there 15 years since that time. All this as a result of the
                    inspection experience of early 1970 in Italy.</p>
                <p>My inspection period lasted for about two and three quarters years. I inspected
                    mainly in Western Europe. Almost all of the major countries of Western Europe
                    with the exception of France. The only country in Eastern Europe was Yugoslavia.
                    I inspected Iran and North Yemen in the Middle East and quite a number of
                    countries in Africa, both in the North and in Black Africa. Outside those areas
                    the only place I inspected was Jamaica.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed my inspection experience very much. At that time inspectors made
                    assessments of U.S. policy with respect to countries inspected which I found
                    perhaps the most challenging aspect of all of inspecting. We also at that time
                    wrote efficiency reports on every American in the mission. I stress these two
                    things because I have the feeling that the functions of the Inspection Corps
                    have altered considerably since the days you and I were in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not sure they write that many efficiency reports
                        which is too bad because they were the most objective efficiency reports
                        that you have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: I was very pleased at one stage when my friend Bob Barbour, who was
                    then working in Personnel, said to me that the people in Personnel valued my
                    inspection reports to the extent that when a name came up for consideration they
                    would ask if there was a Mendenhall inspection report in the file. He said, “You
                    were fair to both the employee and the Department in your assessment.” This was
                    not an easy thing because all these reports had to be shown to the individual
                    and all individuals are well aware that efficiency reports are the means by
                    which promotions are determined. If one had anything adverse to say, one usually
                    brought about a protest on the part of employees. One had to be prepared to
                    justify any remarks that could be interpreted to be in an adverse nature. What I
                    did was to simply try to present an objective picture of what the employee was
                    doing, both in terms of quantity and quality. Let the record speak for
                    itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must be a terribly high pressure, harrowing job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Well it was. I think my stomach reacted to it at times. It was a
                    difficult job writing efficiency reports on everyone. I always found that just
                    as a regular supervisor, efficiency reports were one of the more difficult
                    things I had to do. But as an inspector, one was constantly engaged in that.</p>
                <p>I was also very pleased at the end of my inspection service when the then
                    Inspector General, Tom McElhiney, wrote in my final efficiency report that I was
                    the best inspector he had. So I concluded my inspection career with a feeling of
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>My inspection tour came to an end when I was nominated in August, 1972 as
                    Ambassador to Madagascar. I had gotten a cable, while I was in Madrid
                    inspecting, from the Department asking whether there was any reason why I
                    shouldn't be nominated as Ambassador to Madagascar. I guess this was a routine
                    inquiry sent to all ambassadorial nominees. I cabled back that I was not aware
                    of any reasons why I shouldn't be. When I came back that summer before my
                    nomination had been formally approved—it had been approved by the White House
                    and sent to the Senate—I spoke to Bill Hall, the Director General for the
                    Foreign Service, and told him verbally about the problems I had had with Senator
                    Pell, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. He said, “Don't worry about that at
                    all. Pell was about to be selected out of the Foreign Service when he resigned
                    in 1952, so you don't need to worry at all about that.” I was very pleased to
                    hear his verdict, but I thought he should know that there could be some problems
                    with Pell on the committee.</p>
                <p>I went up for my hearing in early September. I had gone to the University of
                    Delaware, though I had been born in Maryland and was a resident of Maryland. A
                    Senator from Delaware, because of a mutual friend of ours, took an interest in
                    my nomination. Indeed I had put him up overnight when I was AID Mission Director
                    to Laos and he was out there on a mission. This was Senator Boggs, who was very
                    much a gentleman. He took a personal interest in my nomination. He invited me up
                    to the Senate for lunch in the Senate dining room, introduced me to others—I
                    remember Lloyd Bentsen was there—and said he would speak to Senator Aiken who
                    was the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee about me. He did
                    and when I went up for my hearing the principal line of questioning to which I
                    was “subjected” was by Senator Aiken talking about my relationship with his
                    state of Vermont because one of my sons-in-law comes from Vermont. Senator
                    Fulbright absented himself from the hearing—I don't know why. Senator Sparkman,
                    who was very much a gentleman, presided. So I had no problems at the hearing at
                    all. Pell was not present.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I got back to the Department and almost immediately received a telephone call
                    from Senator Pell to say that he had wrestled with his conscience whether to be
                    present and oppose me at the hearing but had finally concluded that he would
                    absent himself from the hearing, but that he still felt it was very unwise of
                    the government to be choosing me to go out to Madagascar as ambassador. Well, I
                    had come back from the Senate hearing feeling rather euphoric but Pell succeeded
                    very much in deflating that feeling. I still have no love for the present
                    Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                <p>I went to Madagascar that fall and found indeed that that ambassadorial
                    assignment was anticlimactic after my experiences in Vietnam and Laos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like mine to Bulgaria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: U.S. interests are so limited. Indeed, before I went out Dave Newsom,
                    who was then Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, said to me that the
                    biggest problem I was going to have to learn in Madagascar was how not to work.
                    He said, “You have held important jobs in your career which have kept you
                    extremely busy and active, but out there you will find that there is not much to
                    do and your greatest problem is going to be how to accommodate yourself to
                    that.” And indeed he was right.</p>
                <p>There were only two U.S. interests in Madagascar. One was port visits by our
                    naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and the second was a NASA space tracking
                    station. I wanted to do what I could to preserve those two interests but found
                    that I was confronted with a very radical Foreign Minister by the name of
                    Ratsiraka. I tried cultivating him over the first several months. He was
                    interested in getting aid from the United States and I said, “On the basis of my
                    experience there is no use trying to get aid from certain agencies in the U.S.
                    government where there is no possibility of getting it for Madagascar, let's try
                    where there is a possibility. Let's ask those agencies where we might get
                    something—among others the Export-Import Bank.” That was the tack that I took. I
                    did everything I could to get a modest amount of aid, but this Foreign Minister
                    was resolved to move Madagascar into the radical camp. At that time he was
                    severing the old relations with France. France had a base in northern Madagascar
                    at Diego Suarez. The French Ambassador was always dean of the diplomatic corps.
                    The French Ambassador occupied the old governor general's residence. Well this
                    radical Foreign Minister cut the French out of all of these privileges which
                    they enjoyed and then turned to the U.S. and the first thing he did was to take
                    our air attach�'s aircraft away from them. We had used that to move around
                    Madagascar. That was his first step. The second step was not to approve any more
                    port calls.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The final thing, the NASA tracking station remained in existence as long as I was
                    in Madagascar, but this Foreign Minister had come to the U.S. on a visit in the
                    summer of 1973 and said that he wanted $10 or $20 million a year in rent on the
                    basis of the agreement which we had with the Malagasy government. Well, NASA had
                    never paid rent for any of its space tracking stations. I don't know why the
                    word “rent” appeared in the agreement, it shouldn't have, but it gave this
                    Foreign Minister the handle with which to pound us. And he did insistently pound
                    us over the next few years, but NASA was not about to set a precedent by paying
                    rent in Madagascar.Also I think this Foreign Minister was annoyed because during
                    his visit here he was not received by Henry Kissinger, who was then Secretary of
                    State. I mentioned in one of our earlier meetings that this was the kind of
                    thing that sometimes redounds against us when the heads of state, or foreign
                    ministers of these small countries come to Washington and don't get the kind of
                    treatment which they got consistently when they went to Peking or Moscow. I
                    think this further turned Ratsiraka against us.</p>
                <p>Well, I decided in early 1975 that the time had come for my retirement. I felt
                    that the U. S. Congress was taking over too much foreign policy, leaving very
                    little role for the executive branch of the government at that particular stage
                    in our history. There wasn't much more I could do in Madagascar, so when one of
                    these periodic programs where one can apply for retirement within a certain
                    window of time with an advantageous pension came along, I opted for retirement
                    at the end of January 1975. The last day of January I got a cable from the
                    Director General of the Foreign Service saying, “Would you like to be considered
                    for one of the UN ambassadorial posts—the one dealing with economic and social
                    affairs.” Well that was that area of activity for which I had declined two jobs
                    years earlier in my career and had no interest in that job and utterly no
                    interest in living in New York. So I cabled back, “Thanks, but no thanks.”</p>
                <p>So my retirement became effective on the end of January, 1975, but I elected to
                    stay on in effect as a political appointee ambassador for another four months,
                    which had an interesting aftermath. In mid February a coup was mounted in
                    Madagascar against the Malagasy Prime Minister. He was assassinated in the coup.
                    This was a coup of the black people against the brown people. The Malagasy
                    population consists of the two. The brown people are of Polynesian origin.
                    Nobody knows when or how they came to Madagascar. The brown people, when
                    Madagascar was an independent country had traditionally held the blacks, who had
                    come from the mainland of Africa, in subjection and indeed slavery. So there was
                    no love lost between these two people. The browns had traditionally prevailed.
                    But by the mid-20th century, the blacks were in the majority and this coup was
                    blacks against browns. The blacks did assassinate the colonel who was a brown
                    Prime Minister. It was really military against military—two opposing military
                    camps. Our residence happened to be in the valley between the two opposing
                    military camps.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>As soon as I got the first word about the coup attempt, on the basis of my
                    earlier experiences of two coups in Vietnam and one in Laos, I rushed to the
                    office in order to stay in contact with Washington reporting what was
                    developing. I felt that my good wife, who was alone in the house with the
                    servants had had enough experience with coups in Vietnam and Laos that she knew
                    what to do—keep your head low. Indeed, she went down into the basement with the
                    five servants and stayed there during the first day of the coup.</p>
                <p>We had three emergency radios in the residence to enable her to stay in touch
                    with me at the office. Every one of those radios failed when the emergency came
                    so pretty soon I was out of communication with my wife. I wasn't unduly worried
                    because I thought she would simply stay put which was the safest place to be
                    with all this gunfire passing overhead. The next morning my defense attach� came
                    to me and said, “I am going to go out and get Mrs. Mendenhall and bring her to
                    the embassy.” I said, “Look, you are going to subject yourself to an undue risk.
                    She knows what she is doing. She will stay there.” He insisted that he was
                    going. He left and it turned out that it was just as well that he did. He
                    arrived at the residence and my good wife, Nonie, was just about to get into our
                    little Volkswagen bug and head for the office because the servants had all gone
                    home at that stage and she didn't want to be alone any longer. She would have
                    headed right into the worst part of it because she didn't know where the
                    fighting was taking place, whereas my defense attach� did. He arrived at exactly
                    the right moment to rescue her and take her to his house so that she did not get
                    involved in the fighting directly. But it was a sort of an ugly experience for
                    her for about 24 hours.</p>
                <p>Pretty soon thereafter the fighting subsided, the coup was over, the blacks in
                    effect took over the government. The man who became the head of it after I left
                    was the fellow who had been the radical Foreign Minister, he was a black. He
                    ousted our NASA space-tracking station. He is still there. That was in 1975 and
                    this is 1991. For many years, perhaps still, he was guarded by North Koreans at
                    his residence. He proved extremely radical during the early years of his regime.
                    I think he has softened somewhat since. I have no direct evidence of his
                    connection with the coup, but I wonder.</p>
                <p>Well, Tully, came May, 1975 we packed our bags. We left Madagascar, moved to
                    Italy where we have been ever since.</p>

                <p>MENDENHALL: Pruning olive trees. Thus endeth the saga of Joseph Mendenhall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't totally quit thinking in the fifteen years
                        since then. I know you have written a bit. Do you want to say a little bit
                        about what kind of interests you have maintained?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Well, I certainly maintain a very active interest in foreign affairs.
                    I have written a very occasional article or book review for publication. I have
                    also written my memoirs for private family purposes. You have gotten a lot of it
                    in our series of oral interviews. In Italy I have been primarily a farmer
                    keeping myself in good shape physically and keeping my place looking well. We
                    also do a fair amount of traveling. We take a trip every year from our place,
                    often by car, sometimes farther afield by plane or on a tour. We also are
                    devotees of opera, particularly Italian opera. At the moment that may be a bit
                    difficult. I think the Italian government is cutting back very greatly on its
                    subsidies to the opera theaters. Last fall, for instance, Florence which has
                    always had a fall opera season had none I think because of the cut in the
                    subsidies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You used to in the summer get first class opera in all the
                        little towns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: Yes, that's right. Another opera festival which had become very
                    famous internationally is the Rossini Festival in Pesaro which was started about
                    ten years ago and had become not only one of the most fashionable, but one of
                    the best opera festivals in the world. I saw an article last summer that there
                    may be no further festivals there for financial reasons. So that reason for our
                    presence in Italy is dwindling.</p>
                <p>We also like good Italian food, although Italy has become enormously expensive
                    like almost all countries in Western Europe with the possible exception of
                    Portugal. We went there 3 or 4 years ago and it hadn't been in the European
                    Community long enough to become expensive yet.</p>
                <p>Turkey, you know is trying to get into the Community. Turkey is still relatively
                    cheap. Not only during my first post but I found on two trips back there during
                    the 1980s that it is a splendid place to visit. From the standpoint of history
                    there is as much to see in Turkey as in any country in the world because of all
                    the civilizations that have existed there over the centuries, such as Hittite,
                    Hellenistic, Byzantine, Selchuk and Ottoman Turk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Large parts of it people don't get to—the ordinary tourist
                        don't get to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: The last trip we made in 1989, we rented a car for a couple of weeks
                    in Ankara and spent several days in Cappadocia which we hadn't seen before. Then
                    went to the crusader castle area down in the south and then to the Hittite area
                    east of Ankara. Also visited the Selchuk towns. The Selchuks were the first
                    Turks in Turkey back in... oh, the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries was when their
                    civilization was at its height. They left some superb remains both south and
                    east of Ankara. In fact one town to which we almost canceled our visit because
                    it was out of our way, Sivas, proved to have absolutely splendid Selchuk
                    remains. And I didn't see a single other tourist there. So, aside from the
                    conflict with Iraq, which will eventually be settled, I certainly commend Turkey
                    to anyone who is interested in that kind of tourism.</p>

                <p>MENDENHALL: That is right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MENDENHALL: There is one thing directly relevant to the Foreign Service which I
                    find disturbing. The talks I have these days indicate that morale in the Service
                    is not at a very good level at the present time. When I inspected those two and
                    three quarter years, going to many posts, there was only about one case of bad
                    morale I found the entire time. I am talking about overseas. I would expect to
                    find morale here low, but abroad morale was generally extremely high, which I
                    understand is not the case today. I have no suggestions as to how to remedy
                    this. I don't know enough about the present situation, but I deplore the fact
                    that morale has changed so much in a Service that both you and I loved. I have
                    said to many of my friends that I would not have traded my career for any other
                    in the world, except one possibly—to be an opera singer and I can't sing a
                    single note and would not have been very successful.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I might say in conclusion is that I personally feel that the
                    present Administration is conducting a very effective foreign policy on behalf
                    of the United States. I can't fault it in any respect. I know there have been
                    complaints that it has appointed too many political ambassadors and not enough
                    career men, and that may well be the case. But other than that in terms of
                    substance I think the Administration has handled every situation it has
                    encountered extremely well. Just as I approved of what the Reagan Administration
                    did in the foreign policy field. I wouldn't say as much for either in the
                    domestic field where I have some differences, particularly with respect to
                    budgetary policy. In the foreign policy field I think those two Administrations
                    have furthered U.S. interests in a remarkable manner.</p>
                <p>I think I will stop at that, Tully. I enjoyed this session just as I did my
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much indeed. This will be a great addition
                        to the archives.</hi>
