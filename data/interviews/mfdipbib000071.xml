                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you retire from AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I retired from AID in 1989 at the end of November after almost 23
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's begin with some of your earlier background,
                        Aaron. Where you came from ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Well, I'll start with my age if you like. I was born on March 21, 1932
                    in New York city; I'm the oldest of four children. I went to school in New York
                    city, high school and college- Brooklyn College; which is part of the City
                    college system. I studied city planning. Actually, I was always interested in
                    architecture, but I ran into a very persuasive professor who convinced me that
                    city planning would be much more interesting and much more comprehensive than
                    architecture would be. So I started the program, found that it was what I wanted
                    and graduated in 1954 from Brooklyn college as an urban planner.</p>
                <p>After that, I took a job with the City of New York's Board of Standards and
                    Appeals, which is actually the Board of Zoning Adjustment. My job was to review
                    applications for zoning variances. It was certainly a very good entry point to
                    get into the field of city planning and learn from the ground up. Durinthat two
                    year period right after I started work, I enrolled in a graduate program at
                    Columbia University's Department of Urban Design in the School of Architecture.
                    I attended for almost a year, and then went on to Pratt Institute's School of
                    Architecture to take a few more courses in urban design and planning.
                    Eventually, I entered a graduate program at New York University's Graduate
                    School of Public Administration and earned a Master's Degree in urban planning,
                    in 1959. After two years of working for New York City, I took an examination by
                    mail for the County of Contra Costa in California near San Francisco for a job
                    as an urban planner, I passed the exam and was offered a position which I
                    accepted. I started working for Contra Costa County during the summer of
                    1956.</p>

                <p>Work as an urban planner</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was out in California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, near San Francisco. As an assistant planner for Contra Costa
                    County, I had the opportunity to work on master planning and subdivision
                    programs as well as zoning. After two years, I was offered an apprentice level
                    job in urban planning with the London County Council in England. I took a leave
                    of absence from my job in California and went off to Europe to spend a year.
                    However, before reporting to work, I visited Switzerland, and as luck would have
                    it, I was offered a job with the city of Zurich in the urban planning division
                    of the city's building department. With permission of the London County Council,
                    I took the job in Switzerland. While there, I did some interesting work in
                    traffic and land use studies. After about eight months, I decided that it was
                    time to go back to the United States. I had taken a year's leave of absence, and
                    time was running out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't exactly the third world, but it gave you a lot
                        of international experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I was doing detailed planning work, and it gave me my first
                    international working experience. After some touring in Europe, I sailed back to
                    the United States. I arrived in New York City and was about to start back to
                    California when a colleague of mine told me about an exciting and innovative
                    urban renewal program in the City of New York that was being managed by the
                    architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, as a consultant to the
                    City. He suggested that I try to get something with the firm. Well, I went for
                    an interview and was offered a job that I couldn't resist. So that's how I got
                    involved in the city's urban renewal program and worked on several very
                    interesting projects like Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. There must
                    have been about 50 urban renewal projects going on, including institutional,
                    commercial and residential development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the mid 1950s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was 1958. I spent two years with that firm doing very interesting
                    projects, and in 1960, moved over to the city administration, which had set up a
                    new agency to do urban renewal projects called the Housing and Redevelopment
                    Board. Prior to that, the program was handled by the Mayor's Ad Hoc Committee on
                    Slum Clearance, headed by Robert Moses, who was very well known in those years
                    as the City's Construction Coordinator and Park Commissioner.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Anyway, I joined the new city agency and stayed there for about five years. I was
                    then asked to become the Urban Planning and Development Director for the City of
                    Elizabeth, New Jersey, which was just across the river from New York City. It
                    was a center of oil refining for Esso and also had a large sea-land port
                    container operation. Elizabeth was a relatively small town with a population of
                    110,000 but it was interesting from the point of view of its industrial
                    development.</p>
                <p>I was on that job for about a year when I got a call from somebody in Washington
                    who asked me if I was interested in going to Bolivia for a month to do some work
                    on Bolivia's fledgling savings and loan system. I said wait a minute, this must
                    be a joke. Bolivia's savings and loan system? I said, who are you? He said he
                    was Harold Robinson Deputy Director of Housing and Urban Development for AID in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>First AID assignment in Bolivia - 1966</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they get your name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Well, they got my name through a non profit organization called the
                    Cooperative Housing Foundation. It was then known as the Foundation for
                    Cooperative Housing (FCH). The organization served as consultants to AID in the
                    field of housing and urban planning. Two years before, they had invited me to
                    take a short assignment in Argentina. Unfortunately, I couldn't do it because I
                    was tied up with my job in New York and I couldn't get away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and Robert Moses were handling New York's problems . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Although not quite on the same level. Apparently FCH had kept my resume
                    and had eventually given it to Harold Robinson. As I mentioned, Harold called me
                    and asked if I would be interested in going to Bolivia I had never met him or
                    talked with him before and was a little apprehensive, but I was certainly
                    anxious to explore the possibility, so I went down to Washington, where he told
                    me about the assignment. After our discussion, I was absolutely raring to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about 1961-62?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: No, it was November of 1966. I had already put in about five years in
                    the city of New York and Elizabeth. I got permission from the Mayor of Elizabeth
                    to take off a month and go down to Bolivia on a TDY. My wife and I went down
                    together. The specific assignment was to prepare a Capital Assistance Paper and
                    Loan Agreement for the first loan to be made to the Caja Central, the Central
                    Bank for Savings and Loan activities in Bolivia. There had already been created,
                    with the help of the Bolivian AID Mission, a single savings and loan
                    association, and the AID Mission was interested in establishing more. The
                    Mission also wanted to create an organization like the Home Loan Bank Board that
                    monitors the savings and loan system in the United States. I completed the loan
                    paper and loan agreement, which were received by both the Mission and the
                    Washington office. As a result, I was invited to join AID to serve a two year
                    tour in Bolivia. My wife and I talked about it and decided that it would be a
                    wonderful opportunity for us. We had no children yet, and were therefore very
                    adaptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is fortunate that she had taken the trip with you on
                        the short term assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, so there would be no surprises.In any event, we went down to
                    Bolivia and settled in, but we really did not know what to expect. Bolivia was a
                    fascinating, exciting place. Imagine landing at an altitude of 13,000 feet. The
                    airport terminal was a tiny building with a roaring fire going in the fireplace.
                    We were struck by the exotically dressed indigenous people from the Altiplano
                    who were walking around the airport grounds with their llamas in tow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it take you a little while to adjust to the altitude
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Interestingly enough, we didn't feel anything initially. We went
                    everywhere and there seemed to be no strain whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were young then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Maybe that was it. But after a while, we did experience unusual
                    phenomena. For example, in the middle of the night I would wake up short of
                    breath and feeling flushed. I was told that this was “siroche”, or altitude
                    sickness, and that it only takes about three months to get used to it. What
                    happens is that the body needs to build up an additional supply of red
                    corpuscles so that it can absorb more oxygen from the air. The whole process
                    takes about three months.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>As for my assignment, I immediately got down to work. My major duties were to
                    monitor the Caja Central loan; provide technical assistance to the Savings and
                    Loan System, monitor the Housing Guaranty Program (three projects) and a Cooley
                    Loan financed housing project promote a feasibility study for the construction
                    industry; and monitor the Credit Union System, which had 150 branches, 50,000
                    members and 4 million dollars in savings. It sounds remarkable, but it was one
                    of the most impressive community level credit systems that I ever encountered.
                    In any event, I settled in to my major task and started working with the savings
                    and loan system, helping to develop several branches around the country, and to
                    strengthen the Caja Central de Ahorro y Prestamo.</p>
                <p>In addition to regulating the Savings and Loan Associations, one of the major
                    functions of the Caja Central was to secure financing from overseas and channel
                    it down to the local S and Ls so they could start the process of lending for
                    home purchase, home improvement and home construction. It was quite interesting,
                    because in countries like Bolivia there had been no such thing as a long-term
                    mortgage. At best, somebody who had some resources could go to a commercial bank
                    and possibly obtain a loan for two or three years, although usually at an
                    exorbitant rate of interest, to build or buy a house. But this program was
                    designed to enable people, particularly middle and lower middle class, to obtain
                    a long term loan at a reasonable rate of interest. Frankly, this program had a
                    political objective in addition to the traditional development objectives. It
                    was felt that it would be important, at least from a political point of view,
                    for people to acquire land, build a house and develop, a real stake in the
                    community, thereby, becoming true middle class citizens with all of the
                    responsibilities, obligations and rights that accrue in a stable democratic
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a separate Ministry for this activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, there was a separate Ministry of Housing, but it was it was only
                    indirectly involved, as guarantor of international loans secured by the Caja
                    Central.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you worked directly with this bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I worked directly with the Caja Central but I also spent time with
                    the Associations. My counterpart was the head of the �aja �entral- Ernesto
                    Wende.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find those people to be very cooperative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely, as well as capable, intelligent and enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were educated folks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Oh yes, in fact, Ernesto Wende was educated in the United States. He
                    also worked for AID when he was younger. He was from the eastern part of
                    Bolivia, and at some point migrated to La Paz. He subsequently went to the
                    united States, came back to Bolivia, and eventually wound up getting a job with
                    AID. After leaving AID, he established Bolivia's first Savings and Loan
                    Association.</p>
                <p>In addition to the savings and loan program, as I previously mentioned, I was
                    involved in other activities like the housing guarantee program, which provided
                    US Government guarantees to American investors, i.e. banks, labor unions, and
                    insurance companies, that loaned money for housing programs in developing
                    countries. The interesting thing about this program is that it didn't cost the
                    US government any money, but actually earned money by charging an administrative
                    fee that paid for the Washington operation of the program as well as the field
                    costs. It earned about 1% which was enough to pay the expenses. The only
                    appropriation that Congress had to authorize for this program was a very small
                    reserve fund just in case there were defaults,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't experience any defaults?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: No, none during my tour of duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's terrific. How many years did you spend there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I spent two years in Bolivia. But I also worked on the housing
                    guarantee program in virtually all of the countries in which I served and did
                    not experience any defaults.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I also worked with the Peace Corps in helping to set up a vocational
                    school for the construction industry. AID provided a grant to a local non profit
                    organization to set up a vocational school that taught construction trades -i.e.
                    carpentry, masonry, plumbing and electrical wiring. The teaching staff consisted
                    of 8 Peace Corps Volunteers and 4 Bolivian technicians. 30 students attended the
                    school. This project was an excellent example of cooperation between AID and the
                    Peace Corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Another related program funded by AID was a feasibility study for the
                    construction industry. All of these activities were linked with the fledgling
                    housing program that was financially supported by the savings and loan system
                    and the housing guaranty program. Housing was a very significant component of
                    the Development Program in Bolivia. Even the IDB was also actively involved in
                    promoting low income housing in Bolivia in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did AID have a big presence there in Bolivia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: AID had a mission of about 25 direct hire Americans plus at least that
                    many Bolivian employees. That was an interesting time to be in Bolivia. I was
                    witness to a change in the essential nature of the AID Program. Congress had
                    determined that AID's focus should change from major infrastructure—roads,
                    electricity and major agricultural reform to a “Basic Human Needs” approach,
                    emphasizing health, education, population and public administration programs,
                    among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you said that Peace Corps had a presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: A large one . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: throughout the country I guess, not only in La Paz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. There were many programs located throughout the country, but I was
                    most familiar with the Vocational School Project in La Paz, since it was related
                    to the construction industry.</p>
                <p>Your mentioning the rest of the country brings to mind the many adventures that I
                    had in Bolivia. If you like, I'll take a moment to tell you about some of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: On one vacation trip, we were out on the Brazilian border, traveling on
                    a major tributary of the Amazon on a little 10 passenger paddle-wheeler. We saw
                    many wonders of the Amazon, including giant anacondas, river dolphin and giant
                    catfish, by taking some canoe trips here and there on little tributaries off the
                    main river. On one of these trips, in the afternoon, we got lost and couldn't
                    find our way back to our mother ship. Night fell and we were hopelessly lost. We
                    kept firing rifle shots to signal our location, and after about 6 hours of
                    drifting around, they finally found us.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>There was a lot of excitement on that trip. The last night of the river trip at a
                    party on board, the boat, my wife dislocated her knee cap, while dancing.
                    Fortunately, the captain of the ship had some medical training and was able to
                    pop it back into place. We all flew out the next day on a small plane to the
                    town of Trinidad, where the knee was set in a cast by a local doctor. We stayed
                    the night in Trinidad, and then boarded the plane the next day, bound for
                    Cochabamba and La Paz. Unfortunately, our DC-3 went down shortly after take off
                    from the town of Trinidad. One engine failed without any warning and a moment
                    later, the other one died. Amazingly, we just glided down and made a soft
                    landing in swamp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your DC-3 must have just have bellied in . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, we just glided in like a kite. It was a very soft landing. All of
                    the passengers, (except for my wife who had to be carried off because of her
                    cast) walked away from the crash without injury. On leaving the plane, we saw
                    that the wings and the engines had been sheared off. We were rescued and taken
                    back to Trinidad on horseback and jeeps. When we returned to the airport, we
                    asked about the next plane to Cochabamba and La Paz, and were told we'd have to
                    wait until the next day. We asked the airline manager if the company was going
                    to pay for the night's lodging. He said No, adding “You're lucky to be alive.
                    What more do you want?.” This response was characteristic of the fatalistic
                    attitude of the people who lived in that part of the country. Apparently, such
                    accidents were not extraordinary.</p>
                <p>In our travels through this part of the country, we saw everything from sugar
                    growing to cattle raising, logging and tanning. It was interesting to witness
                    the ingenuity that people used to sustain themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lot of beef cattle there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, there were large cattle ranches near Santa Cruz, located toward
                    the center of the country.</p>
                <p>Another time, when we went to attend the inauguration of a savings and loan
                    association on the Argentine border, in a town called Tarija. We drove down; and
                    the trip took about three days, over terrible roads. The US Ambassador, Douglas
                    Henderson, was scheduled to travel with President Barrientos, in the President's
                    plane, to be present at the ceremony.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>As the advance party, we had arrived a couple of days before and had made all
                    sorts of preparations for the big event. For example, working with the leader of
                    the local army band and a guitar, I had taught the band how to play the Star
                    Spangled Banner, in honor of the US Ambassador. The conductor scored it for his
                    30 piece army band, and they were all out at the airport at 6 A.M., in uniform,
                    with their instruments, ready to play. The plane landed, but unfortunately, the
                    Ambassador did not show up. Apparently, he and the President were not getting
                    along well that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, goodness . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Anyway, the door opened, the President came out alone, and the band
                    started playing the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he appreciate that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Well, he was a good sport and had a good sense of humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had picked up a new piece of music .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Anyway he was nice enough to offer us a ride back to La Paz in his
                    plane, which he flew himself. It was not pressurized, and we had to go above
                    20,000 feet to get over the peaks, so you can imagine what that was like. I
                    don't remember if the plane was a DC-3 or DC-7.</p>
                <p>It seemed that in Bolivia, we had a new adventure everyday. We spent about two
                    years, there and had a wonderful tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: and had an interesting personal life as well as
                        professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: In addition to the satisfaction that came with professional
                    accomplishments, we had a wonderful personal life seeing exotic places and
                    meeting fascinating people. Bolivia was the kind of place that produces and
                    attracts rugged individualists, renaissance men and adventurers. Bolivia will
                    remain etched in our memories since it was our first long term tour in a truly
                    “different” place, and perhaps most significantly, because our first child was
                    born in La Paz in a small missionary clinic. I was en route home, after
                    attending a conference in the Dominican Republic, when I received news that my
                    wife had given birth to a baby girl. The proud father arrived 24 hours after the
                    blessed event. It's still hard to imagine, a savings and loan system with seven
                    associations and a central bank in Bolivia, especially when you go up to the
                    Altiplano, where the rural culture and indigenous civilization seem to be
                    centuries behind us,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Centuries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, Centuries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a land-locked country too, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It is. Bolivia has always been fighting with Chile, to secure access to
                    the sea. Bolivians even have a special holiday every year when they proclaim
                    their right to access to the sea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Indian population there, is that predominant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: The Indian population there is absolutely predominant, The Indian's
                    life on the altiplano (the high plain) is particularly severe. The climate is
                    cold, he lives in a mud hut, weaves his own clothing from llama wool, and grows
                    his own food, mainly potatoes. His life is a constant struggle for survival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they're small scale farmers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, but production is at subsistence level. The land is virtually
                    barren, since it is way above the timberline.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Bolivia is a country of contrasts. Just outside of La Paz you can drop 4,000
                    feet, in the space of two hours, to the so-called “jungas” filled with hot
                    steamy tropical rainforests. Bolivia also has a gold mining area called Tipuani,
                    in the same region. To reach this area, you wind your way down the mountain,
                    driving on some very steep grades. But then in contrast, if you go five or six
                    hours by car traveling east down the eastern slope of the Andes, you'll reach
                    Cochabamba, which is in a temperate, zone at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
                    Cochabamba has more abundant agricultural production and is a more prosperous
                    community than you will find in most of Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the population of Bolivia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I think in those days it was something like 3 million. There are two
                    capitals. One is La Paz, the commercial center, where virtually all major
                    business and international activities take place, the other is Sucre, the
                    political capital, about 250 miles away, across the mountains. Then you have
                    several other important cities, Cochabamba, which I mentioned before is about
                    seven hours by car, over tough terrain from La Paz. In the central part of the
                    country, you have Santa Cruz, the cattle raising center, which also produces
                    natural gas and rice. It was in Santa Cruz, that I came across one of the most
                    imaginative applications of appropriate technology: construction panels made of
                    cement mixed with the hulls of rice, to give the panels strength and
                    flexibility. Further to the east, are several small communities including
                    Trinidad and Riberalta which produce timber, leather and beef. In the South on
                    the Argentine border, you have Tarija, which is probably more Argentine than
                    Bolivian since virtually all of its contacts, commercial and otherwise, are with
                    Argentina rather that the rest of Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything seems quite spread out with the mountains
                        dividing major sections of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. Everything is pretty well spread out. One of the thoughts that
                    comes to mind when I talk about Bolivia being spread out is that it has common
                    borders with several other countries and is centrally located in South America.
                    You may recall that the famous Che Guevara decided to choose Bolivia as the
                    staging point for his South American operations, probably because it has so many
                    common borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of the body of the octopus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. However, there was something he didn't count on. In 1952, Bolivia
                    had a revolution, and land tenure for the peasants was established,.each peasant
                    receiving his land title. So Che Guevara had nothing to sell to them. He could
                    not promote his political views and simply antagonized them, to the point where
                    they turned him in to the army- and that was the end of Che Guevara's
                    career.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Bolivia had quite a role in stinting communism,
                        perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Well, at least in South America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the program side, how was your support financially from
                        AID Washington and were there other types of support forthcoming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: AID Washington support, financial technical and administrative was
                    generally adequate, though problems often came when a program was initiated and
                    support was not sustained. However, we managed to solve our problems through
                    creative financing. I can give you a little anecdote that will show you how we
                    were able to tap other funds when we ran short. In the case of housing, the AID
                    mission was quite anxious to set up the savings and loan system, and committed,
                    at least in principle something like 5 million dollars in grant funding for the
                    program over a three year period. As it turns out, funds ran short and they
                    could only come up with a million and one half dollars to meet the commitment.
                    What occurred to me, was the use of the housing guarantee program to support the
                    savings and loan system. Heretofore, the guaranty program was exclusively used
                    to finance discreet, individual projects, each with a specific number of new
                    houses, designated in advance of project construction. We were able to convince
                    AID-Washington and some potential investors to let us use some of the guarantee
                    funding to provide seed capital for the savings and loan associations, enabling
                    them to fund individual homes or projects as they saw fit. So we were able to
                    use the housing guarantee funding in lieu of grant or loan funding from AID.
                    This approach solved the shortfall problem that we were facing and ultimately
                    became the model for future use of HG funding.</p>

                        AID's Regional Housing and Urban Development office or was it separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Any program decisions or commitments regarding the Housing Guaranty
                    Program required the concurrence of the Regional Housing and Urban Development
                    Office (RHUDO) and or the Washington Housing and Development Office. With
                    respect to all other programs, I reported exclusively to the AID Mission in each
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean that you were directly responsible to the Mission
                        and not to the Regional Housing and Urban Development Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: That's correct. The Regional Housing and Urban Development Offices had
                    just been established in the early '70s. I started my work in 1967, working
                    directly for the Latin American Bureau, through the AID Mission in Bolivia. I
                    was already stationed in Peru when the first RHUDO South American Regional
                    Office was established in Argentina. Our relationship was collaborative, but I
                    was still reported ultimately to the individual country Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is typical of RHUDO and AID relationships in many
                        places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I believe that it varies with the country. In my own case, although my
                    job title and backstop classification had always been Housing and Urban
                    Development Officer, the same designation used by the AID Housing Office, I had
                    always been recruited by and worked for individual Missions. It was only toward
                    the end of my career, when I came back to Washington, in 1986, that I was
                    assigned to the Housing Office because of my title and backstop
                    classification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I strongly believe that the most effective strategy for helping to
                    alleviate the housing shortage in Bolivia was to strengthen credit institutions
                    i.e. Savings and Loans, enabling them to promote local savings, finance housing,
                    and stimulate the construction industry. These activities proved especially
                    successful when coupled with manpower training and employment generation
                    activities.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Well there is an interesting anecdote at the end, too. I left Bolivia
                    on home leave in July of 1969 after two years, and I was scheduled to return for
                    a second tour. We left on home leave along with our new born daughter all set
                    come back. As it turns out, that summer, the government decided to expropriate
                    the Gulf Oil Company facilities in Santa Cruz. The State Department announced
                    that all State Department or AID employees who were back in the United States
                    would not be permitted to go back to Bolivia at that time. I wound up staying in
                    Washington until November or so. I was told at that point that I was going to
                    get another assignment. I remained in Washington until my assignment to Ecuador
                    in January of 1970 as the Housing and Urban Development Officer with essentially
                    the same kinds of program responsibilities that I had in Bolivia, including the
                    Savings and Loan System and the Housing Guaranty Program. Ecuador already had a
                    Savings and Loan System with several branches and instead of a central bank for
                    savings and loan, it was the government's Housing Agency that managed the
                    savings and loan system. I was able to secure some direct funding, technical
                    assistance, and another six million dollar guaranteed loan for the savings and
                    loan system from a consortium of 19 Savings and Loan Associations in Pittsburgh.
                    This was about the time when the US Congress authorized US Savings and Loans to
                    invest up to 1% of their reserves in the HG Program. I spent two years, helping
                    the Ecuadorians to operate the program. They had excellent people, and had a
                    branch in virtually every major city, including Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Quito.
                    The Ecuadorian S and L System was very impressive, consisting of 10
                    Associations, with 33,000 members. It had financed a total of 3,600 homes in a 4
                    year period, roughly between 1968 and 1972.</p>
                <p>I was also able to secure a 5 million dollar loan for low-income housing and used
                    this program to promote the “Piso-Techo” concept, that is the construction of a
                    simple core house that could be expanded as family resources increased.</p>
                <p>I also got involved in the upgrading of slum neighborhoods called “Barrios
                    Sub-Urbanos” in Guayaquil, a major port city on the Pacific coast. These were
                    squatter settlements that had no streets and were occupied by wooden shacks that
                    had no water, sewers, or electricity. Our programs brought in utilities and a
                    home improvement loan program to help residents upgrade their housing. We also
                    promoted a micro-business program to help them get a start economically by
                    channeling a $250,000 loan through the Ecuadorian Development Foundation. The
                    Barrio upgrading program was generally successful.</p>
                <p>I managed two Housing Guaranty Projects in Guayaquil, one of which was
                    particularly interesting. It consisted of 200 units for lower-middle-class
                    families right in the middle of a large marginal neighborhood. This HG project
                    was managed by a savings and loan branch that was located in the project. It had
                    the effect of promoting the upgrading of homes in the neighborhood outside of
                    the boundaries of the project. We tried everything that we knew to facilitate
                    the upgrading process and those efforts really worked out very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: They were good and very productive. For example, we had Embassy
                    economists and other support staff working very closely with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never served in Latin America, but I always understood
                        that the Embassies worked more closely with the AID Missions in that region

                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Speaking from my own experience, we have always had a positive and
                    cooperative working relationship with Embassy personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had good Ambassadors while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I had good Ambassadors in all the posts in which I have served. They
                    proved to be supportive of our programs, and were always ready to help us to
                    achieve our development objectives.</p>
                <p>I would like to describe another particularly interesting program in which I was
                    involved. This was a program of architectural preservation in which we worked
                    very closely with the Mayor of Quito, Sixto Duran Ballen. He was himself an
                    architect who eventually went on to become the President of Ecuador.</p>
                <p>Quito, with its hundreds of old colonial Spanish structures is virtually a
                    museum. Although AID itself did not finance the restoration of any of these
                    buildings, (this was done by the OAS), we did help by providing some technical
                    assistance for the program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Quito is located at an altitude of 9,200 feet, not quite as high as the
                    city of La Paz, Bolivia which is at 12,000 feet.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take that train trip across the top of the world
                        in Ecuador.</hi>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: You mean down through Guayaquil. No we didn't, unfortunately, although
                    we drove that route several times. However, we did visit the Galapagos and
                    thoroughly enjoyed that trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering about that. It would be a sin if that
                        wasn't a part of your foreign service experience once you were so close. The
                        programs went pretty well there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: The programs went very well. We produced a lot of good housing, for
                    both middle and low income families. We helped to create one of the best Savings
                    and Loan Systems in Latin America.We also initiated a unique program of
                    upgrading marginal neighborhoods through the combination of core housing, home
                    improvement, provision of basic services, credit for micro business, vocational
                    training, and the use of the Savings and Loan Association to administer loans in
                    these low income neighborhoods. In fact, this comprehensive approach became
                    AID's major tool in subsequent years for dealing with problems of shelter for
                    the urban poor. Rather than following the traditional expensive housing project
                    model, we emphasized the more economical core house and the upgrading of
                    marginal neighborhoods, which proved to be a speedier and a much more economical
                    solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID was throughout the country or in a few major cities

                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: We had major housing and Savings and Loan Programs in Quito and in
                    Guayaquil, and we did some work in Cuenca, which was a city to the south.
                    Guayaquil was an important commercial city of about 600,000. Quito, high in the
                    mountains, was the institutional capital, also with a population of about
                    600,000 - 700,000. Cuenca the third largest city, a center of handicrafts, had a
                    population of about 300,000. The AID program encompassed a variety of projects
                    including education, health, agriculture and small business in communities of
                    all sizes throughout the country.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: From Quito, I was assigned to Peru in the summer of 1972 to work on the
                    reconstruction program for a major earthquake that hit at the end of 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a home leave, I guess after Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. I took home leave in July of 1972 and then proceeded on to Peru.
                    The earthquake took place in the north, in a valley called the Callejon de
                    Huylas, located about 150 miles up the coast from Lima and about 50 miles to the
                    east of Trujillo. To illustrate the force of this earthquake, it literally
                    sheared off the peak of Mount Huascaran, causing an avalanche which slid down
                    the side of the mountain into the nearby town of Yungay completely covering the
                    town. In pictures, you can see the tops of palm trees which were about 30 feet
                    high. All that remained visible was the top 5 feet of these palm trees. The town
                    was completely buried in ashes and rock.</p>
                <p>Steve Tripp, who headed the AID Disaster Assistance Office, recently completed a
                    memoir, which describes the disaster in detail. I provided some pictures for the
                    document.</p>
                <p>Other towns that were affected were Trujillo, with a population of 100,000 on the
                    coast, and Chimbote, a town of about 60,000, also on the coast.</p>
                <p>Most of my work in the time that I spent in Peru had to do with housing
                    reconstruction in the two cities on the coast and the rural areas up in the
                    mountains. We secured a $15 million loan and a 28 million HG to meet the housing
                    needs of the 1970 earthquake.</p>
                <p>In the rural areas, both on the coast and in the mountains, we had the
                    opportunity to do something distinct from the traditional guarantee and loan
                    funded housing programs. We worked with the Engineering University in Lima to
                    come up with what we called the Stabilized Adobe program. Adobe was the
                    traditional building material .Together, we devised a system wherein the
                    traditional adobe was mixed with asphalt or road oil, which made the adobe mix
                    waterproof. Then we helped the campesinos (rural farmers) develop a Formica
                    lined wooden form for casting the adobe blocks. The adobe block came out with a
                    surface that was as smooth as glass. This was helpful because when adobe blocks
                    have nicks and chips, they tend to erode very quickly, particularly when they
                    get wet. Also, to help the self help builders avoid the traumatic effects of
                    earthquakes, we taught them to reinforce the adobe block walls. Using an empty
                    tin can, they cut a round hole in each block before stacking them, and then put
                    a cane pole, two inches in diameter, through the hole in the stacked blocks. In
                    this way the cane pole served as a reinforcing rod. The Bureau of Standards
                    tested this system on a. vibrating table and the results showed that this
                    reinforcement which costs virtually nothing, was about 19 times more earthquake
                    resistant than unreinforced adobe. That was an interesting innovation.</p>

                    <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Another thing was that, traditionally, rural people would use home made
                    Spanish tiles for roofing. They were very heavy and caused a lot of damage
                    during an earthquake. We were interested in designing a lightweight roofing
                    system as a substitute for the heavy tiles. So, we devised a method whereby we
                    took bamboo poles, about 2 inches in diameter, laid them out and wired them up
                    in 3 feet square panels, built a basic flat roof structure, laid out the bamboo
                    mats, then covered the mats with 1/4 inch of this stabilized adobe mix. In this
                    way, the roof became waterproof and so light that if it was shaken and ripped
                    off it would cause virtually no damage. I received a great deal of satisfaction
                    in meeting these challenges with alternative construction techniques and
                    materials. The major lesson learned through these activities was that the answer
                    to economical, effective building solutions in developing countries is to use
                    traditional methods and materials, but improve upon them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I had one assistant, a Peruvian civil engineer and a secretary, but I
                    worked closely with the staff of the Housing Bank, the local Savings and Loan
                    Associations and the Department of Engineering of the University of Lima.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Highly qualified?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely. My assistant had a Master's Degree in Civil Engineering and
                    many years of experience. Actually, most of the technicians from the local
                    institutions had Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in architecture and
                    engineering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you were in Lima, the capital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, my office and home were in Lima. but my projects for the most part
                    were in the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This raises the question, did you receive or did you
                        already have Spanish capability? Did you receive Spanish training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I had studied Spanish in high school and college, However, when I went
                    to Bolivia, I was not at all proficient, though, after a couple of years in
                    Bolivia, taking advantage of the Mission's language program and through daily
                    contact with native Spanish speakers, I learned to speak, read and write Spanish
                    fairly well.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you receive training at the mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I took Spanish language training at all of my Latin American posts
                    until I reached a level of 3+.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that working closely with your counterparts
                        that you would almost need Spanish capabilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was absolutely necessary to work effectively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel AID could have done better in that regard, in
                        preparing you before your first mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: No, not really. I believe that to learn a language effectively, you
                    must be immersed in it, preferably in a Spanish speaking country, as in my own
                    case. You really have to be in contact on a daily basis with people who don't
                    know English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were studying Spanish as you went along on your
                        first assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>Returning to the program, in Peru, AID developed a very strong housing guarantee
                    program in Lima and I was involved in that, but it was the reconstruction
                    programs in the northern cities that took up most of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was your backstop in Washington on the housing
                        guarantee program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: We had a Washington based housing office in those days which was headed
                    by Stanley Baruch. Harold Robinson was deputy director for loan and grant funded
                    projects and Peter Kimm was deputy for Housing Guaranty Projects. Juan Cabrero,
                    an engineer in that office, was specifically backstopping the Peruvian Housing
                    Guaranty projects and I was backstopped by Harold Robinson on everything
                    else</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...the man that first recruited you.</hi>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember those names.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Peter Kimm eventually became Director of the Housing Office, which was
                    expanded in the early 1970s to become the world wide RHUDO system, eventually
                    absorbing urban planning and many of the functions of Bill Miner's office over
                    in Central AID. It has since been further enlarged to include environmental and
                    municipal development programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You generally worked through the Bureau, I guess at least
                        the mission did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, except with regard to the housing guarantee programs</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these first three missions that you have mentioned, did
                        you consider all of the project activity successful or were there areas of
                        weakness that could have been improved if they had additional agreement
                        support or any ingredients added? You may want to think about that and feed
                        that in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: My general feeling was that I couldn't have gotten better support from
                    the mission as well as from Washington, although a lot had to do with one's own
                    initiative. In Bolivia for example, I managed a small housing project that was
                    financed by the Cooley Loan Program. Do you remember that? That program came out
                    of grain sales, and was probably a forerunner of PL 480.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: This program was promoted initially by a grain producer in the
                    mid-west. I believe that his name was Garvey. The proceeds from the grain sales
                    were used to finance development programs, and under the Cooley Loan Program in
                    Bolivia, we were able to do a housing project. Housing wasn't the most popular
                    program in the AID portfolio, so we always had to develop creative sources of
                    funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That worked well for your local currency support.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It worked very well thanks to good contacts in the private sector and
                    some imagination. What helped especially was a piece of legislation in the early
                    70s that permitted US Savings and Loan Associations to invest up to l% of their
                    reserves in the Housing Guaranty Program overseas. The Housing Guaranty Program
                    generally opened doors to banks and a large variety of financing organizations
                    in the United States. I used to spend a lot of time when I was on home leave,
                    promoting investment by these organizations in housing programs.</p>
                <p>A particularly good contact was Harold Tweedy, who was the head of the First
                    Federal Savings and Loan Association of Pittsburgh. He had enough faith in the
                    program to invest 3.5 million dollars in the Bolivian Housing Guaranty Program
                    and later agreed to invest six million dollars in Ecuador program through a
                    consortium consisting of 19 Savings and Loan Associations in the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I hear from you is that the private sector in the US
                        and in these developing countries were very effective and played a
                        significant role in your programs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. Both in Bolivia and Ecuador the Savings and Loan System, for all
                    intents and purposes, was private and though the Government did not provide it
                    with any direct financing, the Enabling Legislation that authorized its creation
                    provided a government guaranty for its investments. This made it possible for
                    both systems to develop an international contractual relationship with AID
                    through their respective governments.</p>
                <p>Reconstruction program in Nicaragua - 1974</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished a two year tour in Peru.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was a little less actually, but it was a very productive tour, not
                    only from the programmatic aspect, but also because our son was born in Lima, at
                    the end of September, shortly after we arrived there.</p>
                <p>I think it was at the beginning of 1974, that I got a call from Nicaragua, which
                    had suffered a major earthquake in December of 1972. Apparently, several major
                    fault lines converged right in the center of the old downtown of Managua, the
                    capital city, and with the earthquake, it was literally wiped away. I was
                    invited to come up there to get involved in their reconstruction program and was
                    pleased to accept considering the enormous challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a real challenge for our disaster assistance
                        program as I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes it was. OFDA (Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance) did a
                    tremendous job during the first year after the earthquake, providing emergency
                    assistance, tents, medicine, etc. I went up to Nicaragua in February of 1974,
                    and immediately got involved in several programs. One was called Las Americas, a
                    project to convert 11,000 temporary shelters into permanent homes. These were
                    wooden shacks that were built in three months. We developed a program to make
                    these houses permanent over a three year period. The first stage was to put in
                    utilities, water, sewer, electricity, and so on; the second stage was to put in
                    a cement floor over the dirt floor of each dwelling. Next, we put in
                    pre-fabricated sanitary units, with built in shower and sink just outside of the
                    shelters, replacing the latrines outback.</p>
                <p>The next step, was to build three rows of cinder blocks at ground level, around
                    the perimeter of each house cementing the blocks to the cement floor. At the
                    same time, at intervals of one meter, we installed foundations. These consisted
                    of a steel angle attached to a cinder block. We planted these foundations in the
                    ground and attached them to the block walls.</p>
                <p>Except when the cement floors were being poured, the family was able to continue
                    living in the house while the construction was going on. Eventually, the rows of
                    cinder blocks were built up to window level, the roof was replaced, and rooms
                    were added.</p>
                <p>During this three-year period, schools, day care and health centers were built in
                    each neighborhood, as well as. factories and vocational training centers within
                    walking distance or a short bus ride from the project to provide vital sources
                    of employment for project residents. We had, in the space of three years,
                    converted a community of 11,000 temporary shacks built to respond to the
                    emergency needs of the earthquake into a community of about 8,000 permanent
                    homes served by a complete array of services and community facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a program that was expedited I would assume.
                        There was a lot of pressure to move quickly on this one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Oh yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was well funded I would assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, a $3 million grant was provided at the emergency phase to build
                    the temporary houses, and was followed up by a $15 million loan for their
                    conversion into permanent housing and services. Incidentally, another $15
                    million was provided in Housing Guaranty Authorization for middle-income
                    housing. Apart from housing programs, another $30 million loan was provided for
                    general reconstruction, which included the construction of schools, hospitals
                    and public offices. Also, low cost financing was provided for water and sewer
                    connections in pre existing low income neighborhoods.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Most of the new facilities were built in three distinct satellite centers, seven
                    kilometers from the old center, away from the fault lines, in the vicinity of
                    the new housing projects that I described previously. Each of these centers was
                    to have major shopping and office facilities and were to be connected by ring
                    roads similar to our Washington D.C. Beltway System. Three ring roads were
                    planned which would be intersected at critical intervals by radial roads, coming
                    out of the center of the city. To serve the technical needs of the
                    reconstruction project, I was responsible for the recruitment and management of
                    about 50 expert consultants, including architects, engineers, urban planners,
                    economists, sociologists et. al.</p>
                <p>So, that was the nature of our reconstruction program. I must say that although
                    the plan that I just described was supported by the AID Mission, the Nicaraguan
                    Government and most of the private sector, it was subject to a lot of criticism.
                    There were many interests that wanted to return to the status quo and rebuild
                    back in the old downtown, right on the concentration of fault lines that had
                    caused such horrific damage in the first place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These satellite centers were out in the suburbs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. They were about seven kilometers away from the old center. We had
                    hoped that eventually the old center would be cleaned up and redeveloped with
                    recreational facilities and parks, but under no circumstances rebuilt to the
                    same degree of high density as before. Remember, 10,000 people died in that
                    earthquake; and virtually all of the deaths took place in the old downtown
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a tremendous number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Especially in a town with a population of only 250,000</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they end up with parks in the center of town after
                        that, or did they build back up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: No, unfortunately, at least to the best of my knowledge, the center has
                    not yet been rebuilt at all. Efforts have been stymied because of the political
                    turmoil that has taken place over the years in Nicaragua. I left Nicaragua after
                    about four and one half years in July of 1978, when the Sandinista invasion of
                    the capital city took place. The Sandinistas ran the government for several
                    years, which period was characterized by counter revolutionary activities and
                    economic deprivation. There were great hopes for an economic resurgence with the
                    advent of free elections a few years ago, but regrettably thus far, no major
                    changes for the better have taken place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume under the type of government they had down there
                        before the Sandinistas, the full support of the country was available for
                        the relief programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. The government pledged all available resources to relieve the
                    suffering caused by the earthquake and to restore the damaged and destroyed
                    facilities—schools, hospitals, roads, housing, as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that there was not only a concerted effort to reconstruct and
                    replace damaged public and private facilities, but also to respond to the
                    long-term development needs of not only the capital but also secondary cities
                    like Leon, Masaya, Corinto and Granada. These cities had populations ranging
                    from 20,000 to 60,000. To determine their urban development needs, AID financed
                    a National Urban Assessment which was carried out with the cooperation of INCAE,
                    the Central American Center for Business Administration, which was located near
                    Managua. Urban Planning Programs were developed for the individual
                    municipalities and technical assistance was provided to the Vice Ministry of
                    Urban Planning, which in turn provided technical assistance to the smaller
                    communities. AID was interested in expediting the development of the secondary
                    cities and promoting the devolution of power from the central government and the
                    capital city, to these smaller communities, ultimately transferring to them,
                    economic as well as political power. That in itself was quite an interesting
                    program, and I think we made a very positive impact.</p>
                <p>Also, we had an excellent agrarian assistance program called INVIERNO, the
                    acronym for the Institute for the Welfare of the Farmer. It examined virtually
                    every facet of rural life and provided assistance for various sectors such as
                    agricultural production, marketing, transportation and health, generating market
                    town and rural municipal development technical assistance and loan programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a substantial development program going on at
                        the same time as relief activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: That's right. It wasn't just a reconstruction program. As I've
                    indicated, it was quite varied. Development initiatives in the urban, rural and
                    industrial sectors were being carried out concurrently. The program was
                    ambitious and very challenging. I was professionally satisfied with my
                    contributions to both the reconstruction and long-term development aspects of
                    the AID Program, and I was particularly gratified when the AID Mission nominated
                    me for the Rockefeller Award for my accomplishments. Also, I was one of three
                    winners named for a joint award by AID for the design and management of the
                    grant funded technical assistance program, which helped to create the
                    institutional capability to guide the planning and reconstruction of a new
                    Managua.</p>

                </p>
                <p>A year in AID/Washington Latin America Bureau - 1978</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: We came back to Washington for about a year, and I was assigned to the
                    Latin American Bureau. I was the Urban Planning Officer for the Latin American
                    Bureau. My job was to function as the backstop to meet the technical and
                    administrative urban planning needs of the AID Missions in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever work with Eric Chetwynd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. Eric was in Central AID in the Urban Planning Office headed by
                    Bill Miner. They ran some very interesting programs, including market town
                    development, municipal financing, micro business promotion and regional
                    planning. While I was in Nicaragua, Eric and I worked very closely on a program
                    that was sponsored by his office entitled the International Demonstration
                    Project for Land Use Programming. The City of Leon in Nicaragua was designated
                    as the site of one of three pilot programs, the other two being in Africa and
                    the Pacific region. That project was carried out by a private consulting firm.
                    Other projects such as Municipal Finance and Regional Planning, which I believe
                    provided the basis for AID's current initiatives in Municipal Development and
                    Environmental Protection Programs, were carried out under contract with
                    Universities including Syracuse, UCLA and the University of Wisconsin. I
                    collaborated with that office on several micro business and regional planning
                    projects on my next field assignment in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you spent a year here in Washington on a rotation
                        assignment. Did you consider that beneficial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely. It gave me a bird's eye view of what was going on all over
                    Latin America and it also gave me a chance to get to know the Washington
                    operation better, especially since I had never really served there before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . and the personalities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: And the personalities, of course. I had met many of them, and I had
                    spoken to them on the phone, and so on. But working in Washington on a daily
                    basis is quite another cup of tea. It is certainly tougher to accomplish
                    anything there than in the field, mainly because of the plethora of bureaucratic
                    hurdles that must be overcome.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>In addition to serving as a backstop, much of my time was spent in trying to
                    persuade the Washington Bureaucracy and the Field Missions of the significance
                    of urban issues in the AID Development Program - housing, services, jobs,
                    vocational training, etc. This was a very frustrating exercise due to the
                    resistance of the Agency, mainly due, to the entrenched rural and agricultural
                    interests that, in my opinion, monopolized the AID Program. The standard
                    rebuttal to my arguments was that investing in cities would only serve to
                    encourage migration of the poor from the rural areas, thereby creating a vicious
                    cycle, with AID investment going into a bottomless pit. One of the standing
                    jokes among my urban colleagues was that AID was an extension of the Department
                    of Agriculture. Given my frustration in Washington, I longed for another
                    overseas assignment and felt rescued when I was invited to come to the Dominican
                    Republic in April of 1979 to participate in the Hurricane Reconstruction
                    Program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Reconstruction and housing development in the Dominican Republic - 1979</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I was then assigned to the Dominican Republic, which had suffered
                    two powerful hurricanes in succession, Federico and David, which affected the
                    western half of the island as well as the capital city. My assignment was to
                    manage reconstruction and housing programs related to the disaster.</p>
                <p>I started out by working closely with the Dominican National Institute of
                    Housing. AID was ready to provide grant funding for emergency housing to that
                    agency, but the government bureaucracy couldn't seem to absorb these resources
                    and respond expeditiously to the emergency, so I started looking around for
                    other possibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>As it turned out, several NGOs, already actively engaged in disaster relief
                    programs, were located throughout the Dominican Republic. Among the better known
                    organizations were CARE, Catholic Relief, and Save the Children. I approached
                    them and asked if they would be interested in getting involved in emergency
                    housing programs. They responded enthusiastically and within a week or two, I
                    had several of them signed up. We took small grants of $10,000, $20,000 and
                    channeled them through these organizations. They would hire foremen, typically a
                    carpenter, a plumber, an electrician, each to work with a group of twenty people
                    in the community to help them build simple houses using concrete block with
                    galvanized iron roofing material instead of the palm fronds and shingles that
                    they'd used before, which were hardly hurricane resistant materials. Locally
                    produced block making machines were purchased and people in the community were
                    taught how to make concrete blocks. This program lasted for one year and was
                    sustained by an AID grant of $530,000. It resulted in the reconstruction of
                    1,879 existing houses and the construction of 84 new houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Concrete block houses are very substantial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes. These were very substantial houses. We worked out arrangements
                    where a cooperative would be formed, would be given a grant, and would then
                    contract with individual families. Each beneficiary would have to make payments
                    within his or her economic capacity to repay. This wasn't going to be a gift,
                    but rather a loan that the beneficiary would repay over time. The repayments
                    would go into a revolving fund, and the fund would be used to finance more
                    houses. We had about 20 of these projects going on during the first year. They
                    were innovative and fun to do because with a little bit of incentive and
                    guidance, these people could do virtually anything. They got to the point where
                    they made their own windows-wooden, louvered windows without glass, which is all
                    they needed in that climate. Eventually, some of the cooperative did so well
                    that they sold the surplus windows to the Housing Institute for its projects.
                    These were people who had no previous technical or business experience, but with
                    a little bit of guidance and technical assistance they became successful
                    entrepreneurs.</p>
                <p>This enthusiastic participation by local communities inspired us to finance a
                    Center for Appropriate Technology, which became a research center for
                    traditional building materials and construction techniques. Its function was to
                    explore the use of local materials and building methods to reduce costs, making
                    housing affordable to those who needed it most ..It wasn't until the second year
                    that the Housing Institute got its act together and we grant funded a house
                    repair program, including materials worth $220,000, which were used to repair
                    1,300 units. This grant was followed by a $l.4 million grant that financed an
                    additional 1,000 core houses. In total, between the programs of the NGOs and the
                    Housing Institute 4200 houses were repaired or newly constructed through the AID
                    funded Housing Reconstruction Program.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Incidentally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the Dominican Savings
                    and Loan System, one of the earliest in the AID supported family of Latin
                    American S and L Systems, had under its jurisdiction the administration of
                    several Housing Guaranty Projects. That program started in the middle '60s.
                    Working closely with the Dominican Housing Bank, the agency that oversees the
                    Savings and Loan System, I was able to negotiate a new $15 million HG for
                    Worker's Housing. That program was unique in that the employer provided the down
                    payment, the government the land, and the worker paid the balance of the long
                    term mortgage.</p>
                <p>Initiating micro-enterprise programs in Dominican Republic</p>
                <p>After the early reconstruction phase of the AID Program, I got involved in the
                    micro-business program. It was administered by the Dominican Development
                    Foundation, which worked with smaller groups to fund micro-businesses such as
                    clothing, candy, building materials, all on a very small scale. AID had already
                    given small grants to the Dominican Development Foundation in support of this
                    effort. The program was expanding and the Foundation requested a new grant of
                    $500,000 to help expand its program. Given the good payback record of its
                    clients, AID approved the request, which was coupled with a strong technical
                    assistance component. We were convinced that instruction in management,
                    marketing and accounting was essential to the viability of the program.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example of how successful the program was. Take a family that
                    started with a small home based clothing manufacturing business, with a total of
                    four sewing machines. The family secured a $3,000 loan from the Dominican
                    Development Foundation and was able to buy six more sewing machines and more
                    materials and rent additional work space. In one year, the business had grown to
                    include 25 sewing machines. A key to the success of this program was direct
                    technical assistance in business management - accounting and marketing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's terrific!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was a success beyond our imagination. But all of our micro-business
                    programs grew that way, and where we didn't lend to individuals, we helped to
                    set up “solidarios”, or small cooperatives. The typical cooperative of street
                    vendors (push cart peddlers), for example, included five or six people each
                    financially responsible for the other. If one of the group ran into financial
                    problems the co-op would make up the difference and keep the person going for
                    awhile. So it worked out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your programs ever audited? Did they come out all
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Absolutely, and the results couldn't have been better. The Micro
                    Business Program has become one of the most successful initiatives of AID,
                    representing a maximum return with a minimal amount of investment. Programs of
                    this type can now be found all over the world.</p>
                <p>The AID-sponsored Micro Business Program in the Dominican Republic moved from the
                    micro business up to the small business level. Once the micro business
                    entrepreneur reached a certain production level, let us say 25 sewing machines,
                    he then looked for more substantial credit. AID took this opportunity to develop
                    a larger scale small business and industrial credit program with the Central
                    Bank. Loans were made available at a level of $3,500 -$25,000. In this manner,
                    the size of the credit package was ratcheted up, based upon the initiative of
                    the Dominican small businessman, with the cooperation of the Dominican
                    Development Foundation and the Central Bank.</p>
                <p>After about five years of supporting this program, we recognized a need at the
                    sub-micro business level for very short-term loans for production materials.
                    Some manufacturer would need a loan of $100 to buy cloth, for example, to be
                    repaid in two weeks. The person receiving the loan could then obtain a loan for
                    double the amount-$200 ,and pay it back in four weeks. This progression would
                    continue until the loan reached a level of $1,000, at which point the recipient
                    would be qualified to obtain a larger, long-term loan from the Dominican
                    Development Foundation. A new organization called ADEMI, was created to operate
                    this program, and was initially supported by an AID grant.</p>
                <p>With all of this institutional infrastructure now in place, we decided that it
                    was time to explore the field of export promotion. It seemed that many of the
                    products being manufactured by Dominican micro and small- businessmen could find
                    an international market, so in order to support export promotion, we contacted
                    the Chicago Board of Trade and the Atlanta Trade Fair, both of whom had shown a
                    strong interest in Dominican artisan products - woman's leather and crocheted
                    purses, straw baskets, and the like. These organizations sent representatives to
                    the Dominican Republic, who talked to tradesman, discussing products and market
                    opportunities in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you moved into the export market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, At that point, the Mission changed my title from Housing Officer
                    to Housing and Trade Development Officer. This change occurred at the time that
                    the CBI, the Caribbean Basin Initiative was initiated.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Before we leave the Dominican Republic, I'd like to take a moment to
                    talk briefly about the excellent Regional Planning Project in the Dominican
                    Republic that was sponsored by Bill Miner's Office which had a contract with the
                    University of Wisconsin to provide technical assistance in this area. They
                    studied the southwestern portion of the DR to determine how to prevent
                    environmental degradation and protect natural resources, in that region i.e.
                    topsoil water sources, timber. One of the major threats in the Dominican
                    Republic was the loss of topsoil. For example, when trees were indiscriminately
                    cut down for firewood, the topsoil, previously held down by the trees, would be
                    carried down to the rivers, and dams which would eventually silt up. I recall
                    one disastrous example of these consequences. AID had financed a large dam which
                    was designed to last about 40 years but because of siltation, the dam had lost
                    20 years of its projected life. AID's regional planning efforts were designed to
                    anticipate and prevent this type of problem.</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I had an interesting variety of projects and felt that I had spent a
                    very productive five year tour in the Dominican Republic. One has only to look
                    at Haiti, on the other end of the island, to see the effects of indiscriminate
                    cutting of trees. Actually, the Dominican Republic has enacted legislation
                    prohibiting such cutting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you had been posted in South America, Central
                        American, and now, the Caribbean. That gives you quite a comparison, I'm
                        sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assignment in Egypt - 1984</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, but the greatest contrast was yet to come. My next assignment was
                    Egypt! I said, wait a minute, they must have made a mistake. They don't speak
                    Spanish in Egypt. Apparently, at that time, policy was changing and they wanted
                    to rotate people. Those who had been in Latin America for a long time were
                    destined to go the other side of the world, and vice versa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the 1980s, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: This was already 1984. I was assigned to Egypt, put in charge of a very
                    large utilities program, including water, sewer, for Cairo. I also managed a
                    large sites and services program outside of Cairo in a town called Helwan. This
                    program involved taking a large piece of desert land, owned by the government
                    cutting it up into 7,000 lots; facilitating the installation of water, sewer,
                    and electricity, and finally, encouraging banks or other credit institutions to
                    finance houses for low income families on these lots. This type of program is
                    what we call the sites and services approach. We also financed upgrading
                    programs for seven existing small communities, upgrading their water, sewer and
                    electrical systems and promoting home improvement where it was possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The Egypt AID Mission was very large compared to what I had been used to in Latin
                    America. It had about 140 direct hires and an equal number of contractors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the entire mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served a two year tour there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy the contrast with Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was different but equally rewarding. It involved working under
                    difficult desert conditions, with dust and extreme heat, but the work was just
                    as challenging and professionally satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family there with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes they were there. We lived in a pleasant community called Maadi,
                    about a half hour from Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an American school there? How many children did
                        you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, the American School was located there. We had two children, one of
                    high-school and the other of junior-high-school age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The school is supposed to be excellent there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It is excellent. We all enjoyed living in Egypt. Aside from the
                    challenges of the programs and the work we were doing, the country, from an
                    historical point of view, is absolutely fascinating, One can't even begin to
                    describe the excitement of being there and visiting the ruins. Every weekend
                    presented another opportunity to visit one magnificent archeological site or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is one of the fringe benefits of the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: My projects in Egypt were quite large and were initiated prior to my
                    arrival and unfortunately, my involvement in them was for too brief a period of
                    time. Although I had intended to return to Egypt for a second tour, I could not
                    return because of medical reasons. We returned to Washington in the summer of
                    1986, where I was assigned to the Housing Office.</p>
                <p>Three years in AID/Washington's housing office - 1986</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I spent three years until I retired. While in that office, I
                    backstopped programs in Latin America and in West Africa</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a regional housing office in Abidjan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel to West Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I made one visit to the RHUDO in Abidjan. Back-stopping consisted
                    of typical AID desk officer operations— responding to requests for technical
                    assistance from the field, reviewing field office budgets, shepherding these
                    budgets through the Washington bureaucracy, helping to shape policies and
                    programs, and helping to put out fires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Someone else had responsibility for RHUDO over in Nairobi,
                        backstopping them? You didn't cover all of Africa did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Oh no; it was just West Africa. We had two regional offices, one
                    covered East Africa and the other, in the Ivory Coast, covered West Africa.
                    Subsequently, I backstopped the RHUDO in Central America, located in
                    Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make a trip down to Tegucigalpa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Several times. That was familiar territory, since I had spent five
                    years in Nicaragua. In June of 1989, I was advised that I would be reaching the
                    end of my time in class, and that since I had not been promoted into the Senior
                    Foreign Service, I would have to retire by the end of November of that year. The
                    news came as a very unpleasant surprise, and I wasn't ready for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That in a way seems to be a mistake-to waste all the
                        experience that a person had in a technical field. Perhaps it's different if
                        it is administrative and that skill could be replaced.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I couldn't agree more. Such forced retirement is a clear example of
                    “cutting off your nose to spite your face”, This is a defect in the system that
                    probably has done more to weaken the AID program, by lopping off seasoned, field
                    tested personnel who have moved to the top of the structure and replacing them
                    with inexperienced, unseasoned officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your tour throughout Latin America and Central
                        America were there periods where you or your family were subject to real
                        danger in coups or something like that in addition to the DC-3, landing
                        which was rather unanticipated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I remember one time, when I was away from Egypt on a TDY to Zimbabwe,
                    there was a prison escape in Cairo. The escapees took cover near the American
                    School in Maadi, and there was a lot of shooting going on. I was concerned
                    because my children were there. Fortunately, no one was hurt.</p>
                <p>Feelings of unease started to develop with the hijacking of a TWA Flight in 1985,
                    one that we were originally scheduled to take to Athens, and then on to the
                    United States for vacation. Fortunately, at the last minute, we changed our
                    flight to AIR EGYPT, and heard about the incident when we arrived in the US
                    There were 4 people killed by the hijackers. Another incident which made us very
                    uneasy was the hijacking of the Achille Lauro, an Italian Cruise Liner off the
                    coast of Egypt. Also, it did not help our morale when there was an assassination
                    attempt on the Israeli Consul a few blocks from our house.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these problems, travel around the country was relatively easy.
                    Apart from our weekend trips to archeological sites, we took a major trip by car
                    to Israel, across the Sinai Peninsula. We were never stopped in Egypt, but were
                    stopped and searched several times in Israel. (Of course our car had Egyptian
                    License Plates).</p>
                <p>There was a time in Nicaragua, at the end of the school day at the American
                    school outside of Managua, when there was a shooting incident. The school was
                    located near the University and there was crossfire between the students
                    supporting the Sandinistas and the National Guard. Our children were driven home
                    by a friend and had to get down on the floor of the car and away from the
                    windows as the shooters drove by. Luckily, they were unharmed, but that was
                    really scary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No one was injured?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BENJAMIN: No, fortunately. Another sort of curious incident was when we took a
                    trip to Honduras in early 1978. We drove up to the Bay Islands on the north
                    coast of Honduras, during our vacation from Managua. We were driving back to
                    Managua from Honduras, when at a place about 25 miles south of the Honduran
                    border, we were stopped by Sandinistas. They ran out of the bushes, approached
                    the car and asked who we were. We told them, and they didn't detain us. But then
                    about one half mile further down the road, an army helicopter came down and
                    landed right in front of us. Soldiers got out and asked who we were and what we
                    were doing there. We explained, and they let us go on our way. Northern
                    Nicaragua was clearly a sensitive area at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a few different incidents than you are accustomed to
                        in the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Then of course I told you about Che Guevara in Bolivia, but that was
                    more smoke than fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, your visit to Zimbabwe, How did you find things down
                        there? Was it a new country at that point? They gotten their freedom from
                        Rhodesia around 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: It was hard for me to believe that I was in an underdeveloped country.
                    At least on the surface, it displayed all the trappings of a modern western
                    county_ good infrastructure, comfortable housing, and what appeared to be a
                    healthy economy, although the poor didn't seem to share in these amenities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rhodesia was quite a developed country before it became
                        Zimbabwe. It was a beautiful place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I would have enjoyed being assigned there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find it much different in West Africa other than
                        the city of Abidjan and maybe Dakar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: I think so. Poverty was much more evident in West Africa than in
                    Zimbabwe, judging by the predominance of slum conditions and marginal
                    communities.</p>
                <p>Liaison with the Office of Disaster Assistance</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Another interesting activity in which I was involved when I was in the Housing
                    Office in Washington was my role as liaison with OFDA. I was able to get
                    involved in some of their disaster related emergency relief activities. I
                    remember Hurricanes Fifi and Gilbert among the big ones in 1987. I made a couple
                    of trips to Antigua and Montserrat with the Disaster Group and worked very
                    closely with it to develop Preventive measures and emergency shelter standards
                    for disaster relief. This included recommendations to develop a network of local
                    PVOs or NGOs in each country that could serve as agents for immediate response
                    to disaster.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations</p>
                <p>BENJAMIN: Before concluding this session of my oral history, I would like to make
                    a few observations on the place and evolution of urban development as a
                    component in the AID Program. With the passage of the years, we are beginning to
                    realize the importance of recognizing and responding to problems in urban areas,
                    particularly in developing countries. Initially, the only way that AID ever got
                    into urban development in a serious way, was in response to natural disasters or
                    because of political expediency, and not, particularly, to reach sound urban
                    development objectives It is interesting to note that three of my six overseas
                    assignments—Peru, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic were related to disaster
                    reconstruction, rather than programs to achieve urban development goals. Egypt
                    was a special case, where the large metropolitan concentration of Cairo, with a
                    population of 10 million in 1984, served as a sponge, ready and able to absorb
                    major inputs of capital in water and sewer systems that were committed for
                    political reasons (the Peace Treaty with Israel).</p>
                <p>Regrettably, Housing and Urban Programs have never received high priority from
                    AID. It was always difficult for me to understand why AID always had a general
                    prejudice against Urban Development Programs, particularly housing. I believe
                    that the housing sector deserves special attention especially since housing
                    production brings so many positive virtues. It has always been a great generator
                    of employment; the construction industry is often the first step up the economic
                    ladder for migrants from rural areas; generally, the housing industry will use
                    local materials in construction and finally, housing ownership creates deep
                    roots in the community, strengthening the democratic base in that locality.</p>
                <p>The low priority AID gives to urban development is particularly unfortunate as we
                    recognize the accelerated and uncontrolled growth of urban areas which has
                    resulted in a plethora of mega cities around the world. This phenomenon was
                    anticipated by the World Bank when, in 1975, the World Bank Paper, “The Task
                    Ahead”, predicted that by the year 2,000, the majority of cities, at least in
                    Latin America would have doubled in size. In effect, the rural poor will have
                    become the urban poor. The World Bank anticipated that urban dwellers would
                    exceed three quarters of the national populations, with about half of the
                    increase coming from a rising birth rate and the rest from a rural to urban
                    migration.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, most of the new city dwellers are poor, offering few, if any
                    marketable skills. Normally, increased urbanization in itself is a natural step
                    in the process of economic development, but it is the capacity of cities to
                    absorb these newcomers and manage growth that is the major issue. There is
                    little reason to believe that resources will be sufficient to accommodate
                    anticipated urban growth, nor are efforts in population planning and rural
                    development likely to reduce its pace and scale significantly. During my tenure
                    with AID, I had always stressed that the objective of any responsible urban
                    strategy must be to improve the capacity of towns and cities to more equitably
                    distribute resources to the poor by providing them with productive employment
                    and essential services. These must include the full gamut from small-business
                    promotion to manpower training, job placement and job creation, Housing, sewage,
                    water supply, electricity, transportation, education and health services must
                    also be included.</p>
                <p>I felt, during the '70's that, unlike the rest of the developing world, most
                    Latin American countries were already heavily urbanized, and probably would
                    match the industrialized West, within 20 years. Therefore, I maintained that any
                    AID program in Latin America, should focus on the urban poor, serving as a model
                    for other nations that are tracing the steps of Latin America into the twenty
                    first century.</p>
                <p>Although AID has been making some efforts in recent years to serve the urban
                    poor, given the magnitude of the problem, its response has been far too weak. As
                    the AID Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean, Abelardo
                    Valdez indicated in his testimony to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US
                    Congress, on February 14, 1979, “The growth of urban poverty in the Region is
                    accelerating, and in the 1980s it will replace rural poverty as the most
                    significant problem in the Hemisphere.” To further quote Mr. Valdez, “While
                    continuing our emphasis on the rural poor, we must give increased priority to
                    urban sector programs that expand employment and bring basic services to the
                    rapidly growing numbers of urban poor. We need to develop programs that provide
                    credit and technical services to small businesses and the self employed,
                    encourage labor intensive industry, support management planning and training,
                    and provide assistance to upgrade slums and squatter settlements and to
                    strengthen institutions responsible for low cost housing and improving community
                    facilities.” In my view, this admonition is as true today as it was 20 years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>AID began to reshape its policies and programs to respond to these needs although
                    all too slowly and with too little resources but at least it was a beginning.
                    AID saw the wisdom of investing in a strategy of market town development, the
                    purpose of which was to provide urban services in rural areas, strengthening
                    local government, promoting the devolution of power from the capital, and
                    thereby reducing migration thereto.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The extensive involvement of AID in the Latin American Savings and Loan System
                    also warrants a few observations. Oddly enough, while the Savings and Loan
                    operation in the US during the '70s and '80s were becoming less regulated,
                    permitting investments in non housing related activities, AID was insisting that
                    the Latin American Savings and Loan Systems focus on their primary task, that of
                    providing long term mortgage financing at reasonable rates for middle and lower
                    middle income housing. Close supervision of local associations by the Caja
                    Central in Bolivia, for example, kept these goals in sharp focus.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the results of deregulation in the US System and its loss of
                    focus and purpose, led to its financial collapse, ultimately costing US
                    taxpayers billions of dollars, while the carefully regulated Latin American
                    Systems have never been healthier, continuing to serve and place emphasis on
                    middle and lower middle income housing, and in many cases, i.e. Bolivia, Ecuador
                    and Peru, serving the poor through core housing, sites and services and home
                    improvement programs.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I'd like to reflect on some of the aspects of my AID Career that
                    have provided specific rewards during my retirement. I have had a very positive
                    experience as a volunteer producer with a local Community TV Station in
                    Arlington, where I participated in the production of two shows on micro-business
                    in the Dominican Republic, reflecting my experience in that country. This was a
                    broadcast in the Spanish language, which I believe would have received a high
                    level of interest from local residents who have emigrated from Latin America,
                    but who have the hope of returning some day to their native countries and
                    investing in a small business, with savings accumulated in the US.</p>
                <p>Another positive experience as a volunteer related to my overseas work has been
                    with the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History on several archeological
                    projects. This interest in archeology was developed after having served in
                    Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Egypt.</p>
                <p>I think that this completes my input for the present.</p>
