                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 21st of July 2000. It's an interview with
                        David E. Long. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by David?
                        David, let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you
                        were born and something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I was born in Washington, Georgia, on November 21st, 1937. My father was a
                    Presbyterian minister. He and my mother met in Florida when my respective
                    grandfathers went down to make a lot of money after World War I. They grew up
                    together and ultimately got married. She trailed along with him with the then
                    Southern Presbyterian Church. They moved a lot, I lived in Georgia, Oklahoma
                    City; Marietta, Georgia; and in about sixth grade I moved to Palmetto, Florida,
                    which is just south of Tampa in the southern end of Tampa Bay. That's where I
                    went through junior high and high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your father and then of your
                        mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LONG: My father's family were Scotch Irish, a typical story of Pennsylvania
                    south. The original Long, whoever he was, came from Scotland. I think he was on
                    the wrong side of the 45, 18th century, and went down the valley of Virginia,
                    I-81, and ended up Morristowfamily, going through several generationended up in
                    Morristown, Tennessee. I understand the farm was under the water of a TVA lake.
                    From there they branched into Alabama and into Georgithis is a very typical
                    story. His father grew up in northern Alabama, where my grandfather Hanson on my
                    mother's side had moved from Denmark to Perth Amboy, New Jersey. He came down
                    with a bunch of Danes to start a scientific farming community. The Danes
                    couldn't stand the sticks and the wilds of Alabama and all moved home. He farmed
                    this place with draft horses and no mules, which he said was one of the tourist
                    attractions to come to see Mr. Dane back in those days. His grandfathers went
                    together and placed 60,000 or 70,000 acres of woodland in Volusia County. He
                    went down there, and when the sawmill business boom busted in Florida before
                    '29; he was about 26. My father went to the University of Alabama for three
                    years, Davidson College for two years, Southern Presbyterian Seminary in
                    Atlanta, and began preaching at the inauspicious time of 1932, '33...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just when the Depression hit. How about your mother? She
                        was of Danish...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: My grandfather was an enhanced Christian Hansoprobably a story not unlike a
                    lot of immigrants who immigrated from �rhus, Denmark in about 1901, somewhere
                    along in there. He did very well in a grocery story in Perth Amboy. Then he
                    moved with this Danish farming community to Jasper, Alabama, and then he was a
                    farmer. Then he moved to Florida and made a lot of money, lost it, and did it
                    all over again, in the land. He made fair success in the furniture business, and
                    there was a run on the bank and he went broke again and went to Daytona Beach
                    late in the '20s and started all over again in real estate. By the time he died
                    he had provided a little rooming house for my grandmother for income. An ironic
                    thing is that his youngest son, my uncle, grew up in Daytona Beach with a fellow
                    named Brice Baggett. I met my wife at Chapel Hill many years later, and her
                    uncle was Brice Baggett. I didn't put that together for quite a while, but it
                    was sort of a coincidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your mother meet your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: They grew up together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they grew up together. Did she go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: She went to Stetson, which was in Deland, which is not far away, and got a
                    teaching certificate, which required only two years of college back then, and
                    became a school teacher until she became an unpaid assistant pastor.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up as a preacher's kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: It's a unique thing that only PKs really understand. You know the term
                    'PK'? There are number of ways that you can raise a PK, none of them very
                    successful, I think. One is you can shelter them and teach them through
                    rose-colored glasses that 'Jesus loves me'. They find out about junior high or
                    when they go through puberty that it isn't quite like what they had been taught.
                    A lot of them slip the traces, and this is your wild kid. I, on the other hand,
                    and my brother to a lesser extent, were not terribly sheltered. We used to sneak
                    down and listen to my father pray over the parishioners in his office with my
                    mother late at night, and we would find out all the dirt that was going on.
                    Presbyterians are sort of upper middle class types. They were the bankers and
                    lawyers of the town, and we called them whited sepulchers because they were very
                    religious on the outside but as human as they next guy on the inside. So it was
                    an education. Some people have said I'm a cynic; I think I'm a realist. A cynic
                    to my mind is a person who's disillusioned, and I didn't really have many
                    illusions at the start. So I sort of more or less accepted people through this
                    jaundiced view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was family life like? Obviously your mother and
                        father were busy, but did you sort of sit around the table and bat around
                        ideas as kids with you and your brother and your parents, or were you pretty
                        much on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, all of the above. They were very busy, and anybody who is a kid of
                    somebody who is a public person is. On the hand, we were very much of a family,
                    but it didn't require physical presence the way some families feel they have to
                    be family. One thing we used to do every Sunday was pick apart his sermon, and I
                    thought that was a perfectly natural thing to do. I probably learned more
                    homilies than most preachers know today, because I learned how to critique a
                    sermon: the delivery, the organization, the substance, the jokes, the whole
                    thing, and I thought that was normal. Years later I realized what he must have
                    gone through having this bunch of critics blow him away. Fortunately he was a
                    very good preacher. But that really honed my critical faculties at a very young
                    age.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also shows extreme tolerance on the part of your
                        father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes. Another thing he used to do, he would correct our grammar. I never
                    realized that correcting somebody's grammar was not socially acceptable until I
                    started dating, and the girls I dated took offense when I would correct their
                    grammar. I thought that was just what everybody did and had to learn the hard
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About education, start in elementary school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I went to elementary school in Oklahoma City, where we had tornado drills
                    and all the kids would march out of the school and go into a storm ditch to
                    practice in case of a tornado. There were a bunch around but none ever hit us. I
                    went later to a school in Mariettthis was during World War IMarietta, Georgia,
                    and there was an airplane factory right by. It was called Bell Bomber Plant, and
                    Bell was bought out, I think, several times and ended up Lockheed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They do the 130, C130...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Right. In those days it was the B29. So my father took in about 900
                    members. He started with a church of about 300 and ended up with a church of
                    about 300, because people were coming and going and coming and going. It was a
                    wild time, and the teachers more or less just tried to give these poor kids the
                    basics, and those of us lived there were more or less on our own. It was sort of
                    pre-Montessori Montessori for the rest of us, and you could get out of what you
                    wanted to, and I had a great time with no discipline. I don't mean physical
                    discipline, but I didn't have any mental discipline. We did it ourselves, and
                    that set the standard for how I've been a free thinker, I guess, ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? What were your interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Our family has always read, yes, and still do, so I grew up reading. My
                    other grew up reading to us until we could read, and I would check books out of
                    the library before I could even read. Some of them I memorized the stories so I
                    could “read” the text of Uncle Wiggly books by looking at the pictures and I
                    knew the text by heart. We've always read.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular books, authors or something that
                        particularly stuck in your mind in your early years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Early, early years, Uncle Wiggly, Winnie the Pooh, Alice in Wonderland, and
                    my father would explain to me the adult humor which I didn't understand at the
                    time, but I did realize that it was really not a children's book. And, you know,
                    you graduated to Fenimore Cooper, the usual stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Marietta, through what grades?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: We were there third, fourth and fifth grades.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting a good dose of “the war?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, for a kid. Obviously the horrors of war were not borne upon us
                    directly, but I remember other things such as when my uncle, who was a navigator
                    on a B26 over Italy, visited us in Oklahoma City. He was sleeping out on the
                    sleeping porch, and it had these screens that had plastic on them that they had
                    in those days. The wind blew, which was 24 hours a day in Oklahoma City. These
                    things would bend back and forth, and he couldn't sleep because he said he would
                    wake up thinking he was in the middle of a air battle with all the noise. That
                    experience really brought me to the war, and I remember listening to the radio
                    when Roosevelt announced VE Day, VJ Day...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been Truman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, Roosevelt and Truman...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roosevelt died just before the VE Day, so it was Truman
                        for both..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Oh, I know; it was his death. It was on every station, and I had a crystal
                    radio set that I had just made but all I could get was this one station. So I
                    finally went in and turned on the radio to see what other stations were on and,
                    of course, it was the same thing on every station. I thought something was
                    dreadfully wrong with the set. Then I went into another room and my parents were
                    listening to it and I actually stopped to listen to the words. I remember
                    Roosevelt's death, and, you're right, Truman's announcing the VE and VJ Day. So
                    I think I've had an inkling for a young child of the fact that the world was at
                    war. I think everybody did in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got down twhere was it in Florida?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Palmetto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get there? What grade were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Sixth grade; that would have been 1948-49.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's sort of where you grew up, did a lot of your
                        growing up, there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: That's where I went to Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, high school and all of
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: It was a small town. It had been founded, I guess, in the 19th century by a
                    bunch of South Carolinians, hence the name. They used to say there needed to be
                    about 20 respectable funerals if it were ever to go, which they didn't want it
                    tand looking back they were absolutely righand it still hasn't grown. It still
                    looks pretty much the way it did back then, which is really a rarity in Florida.
                    It was a small town; everybody knew everybody; and, as I say, Cub Scouts, Boy
                    Scouts, school activities, church activities, friends and schoolmates that I've
                    kept up with to this day. So it was a very formative time. My parents moved to
                    Tampa, in October of my senior year. I played in the band and I was on the
                    tennis team, the swimming team, and all that stuff. One day in band this
                    classmate of mine came up to me and said, “How would you like to live with us
                    for the rest of the school year,” and I said, “That would be great.” His father
                    was an engineer, and he had bought this old wreck of a house that was a mansion
                    that had been built by Powell Crosleyou know, the Crosley caron Sarasota Bay in
                    the southern part of Madison County. When I got home, my mother said, “I
                    understand the Hortons want you to go and stay with them the rest of the year,
                    and I said, “No” you know how children are; said I with the wisdom of being in
                    6th grad“that's just Allen talking.” Well, it never dawned on me that it was
                    Mrs. Horton who had called up my mother. From October to graduation I lived with
                    the Hortons in this big, old place. It was right across the county line and the
                    city limits from Sarasota, the next town down. They wanted company for Allen
                    because there weren't any kids his age down there at all, and so my job, which I
                    could choose which obviously I did, was bringing out Allen. They had this big
                    swimming pool right behind the house, and the living room was about 40 feet
                    long. It was a great house. His dad said, “If you guys will paint the pool, I'll
                    let you have a pool party,” and Allen quickly said, “No, we can't do that,” and
                    I remembered Tom Sawyer and said, “Wait, wait, wait.” So I called up the head of
                    the cheerleaders, who was the sex symbol of all boys in high school, and I said,
                    “Martha, I want you to recruit the biggest and dumbest of the football players,
                    and you all come down and I want the cheerleaders to make a lunch. We're going
                    to have a painting-the-pool party and then those who participated, plus those
                    who we agree on, we will invite to the senior prom and we'll have a party.” So
                    to Allen's utter amazement, these guys just rushed down to work in the hot sun
                    and loved every minute of it. And so we had this big party. So I brought Allen
                    out. He was a social success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you play Tom Sawyer while the football team
                        painted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Right. I got a bunch of directors' chairs and he was sitting in one of
                    these, and big guys would come up, “Allen, what should I do now?” And he'd say,
                    “Well, why don't you go down with the guys on the shallow end and paint a little
                    down there.” We basically just put paint on the pool. That launched Allen in his
                    social success though. We had a good time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, how about course, reading, or influence
                        and all? Did anything particularly influence you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: No, not in particular. I took the usual college prep courses, and there
                    were some very fine teachers. Fortunately for me, Palmetto High School and
                    Bradenton High School were joined to make Manatee County High School in 1948,
                    and that lasted until 1958 when they were separated again. I graduated in 1955,
                    so I had the advantage of going to a larger school that had more course
                    offerings, excellent teachers. So I took the usual, all the math courses,
                    everything. I didn't work too hard at it, I guess. My mother was furious. She
                    was a puritan-ethic woman, and when she found out that I got bumped out of
                    valedictorian because I made a C in speech, because I wrote on my evaluation
                    that I really hadn't learned very much, she was absolutely furious at me. But I
                    got a very good high school education.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about international affairs while you were in high
                        school? Did the world outside penetrate Palmetto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: A bit, mostly Latin America, of course, because it was near Tampa. Believe
                    it or not, that's where all the Cubans were because they had come to make cigars
                    for Jose Ivor back in the 19th centurthis was before Castro. Then in my senior
                    year Mr. Horton took Allen and me and his wife to Havana. His firm was working
                    on a big luxury hotel down therthis was before Castrand so we went down and
                    drove all over. We took the ferry from Key West and drove all over the island. I
                    can't tell you the minute that I became interested in foreign affairs, but I
                    certainly loved it and certainly from that moment I was fascinated by the world
                    outside me. I had no inkling of wanting to be in the Middle East until much
                    later; but it sort of evolved more than was planned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume that where you were brought uit wasn't
                        called that at that time, it wasn't considered thain a segregated society.
                        What was your appreciation of this at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LONG: My anti-prejudice prejudices have been reinforced living in the Foreign
                    Service. I think that the perception of segregation in the United States has
                    beehow would you say it, the opposite of being romanticizeit's demonized. I
                    think Americans have an underlying conviction that victims are morally superior
                    to victimizers, and that ain't so. The opposite isn't so either. People are
                    people. I used to get my papers down at a feed store, and there was a black guy
                    who got his papers and we were good buddies. We talked about all sorts of
                    things, and he was a good friend of mina friendship that would be much more
                    difficult to have now because of the sensitivities of Afro-American and all this
                    stuff that's come in between. I'm not romanticizing this. My father really did
                    instill in us that we're all God's people and we're all equal in the sight of
                    God. And even whether you don't believe in God, that concept was hammered home
                    to us and was just not questioned. The vagaries of living physically separated
                    was something one accepted because that was just the order of things. One of the
                    fascinating things about Palmetto, when they made Palmetto High School on one
                    side of the river and Bradenton High School on the other, they gerrymandered it
                    so that the black section of Palmetto would go across the river. They didn't
                    rename it Bradenton; it was Manatee High School, but it was no longer the county
                    high school, it was the Bradenton High School, so that they could get the
                    football players from that side. Now, that was after I had left, but I was not
                    surprised at all at that kind of gerrymandering for particular purposes. Also, I
                    remember we didn't have any particular views about Spanish one way or the other
                    down in Palmetto. My mother started teaching school in Tampa. She finished her
                    degree at Tampa U in order to help put us through college. Of course, she never
                    stopped teaching after that, so I realized there was a little more to it than
                    that. There was a clack of Cuban people that had moved into the Education
                    Department of Hillsboro County and ran it, and she used to talk about “the
                    Cubans, the Cubans,” and I said, “Mom, you're a bigot.” “No, no, no, I'm not a
                    bigot.” But it brought home that rightly or wrongly when people feel ethnically
                    threatened, then they begin to demonize the people that threaten them. I think
                    this is a universal attitude, so I never localized it to the South or to the
                    United States or to any one particular area. To me, this is behavior that's
                    universal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Because they gave me the best scholarship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Davidson is a Presbyterian college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Oh, with a passion. Less now than it was then. It was also all men back
                    then, which I couldn't stand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Davidson like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I once saw something that said that Davidson was an Ivy League wanna-be,
                    which totally missed the point. They didn't 'wanna be'. They were pretty darn
                    smug, satisfied with what they were, which is a Southern, liberal arts, very
                    rigorous school, and they still are. The fact that they don't recruit very much
                    from outsidthey make half-hearted attempts to do so by getting Presbyterian
                    churches all over the United States to say, “Hey, that's a great place to go.”
                    They really don't do it, but my education there, certainly course wise, was
                    every bit as good or better than the quality of education I had in graduate
                    school at Harvard or Fletcher or Carolina. It was excellent. The teachers were
                    not required to research or publish; they were required to teach. Classes were
                    20, 15 in some of the upper division classes. You could always see your
                    professor. It was an excellent education. The quality of the kids that went
                    there was as great a bunch of guyit was an all men's school thewhich I ever met.
                    I still keep up with lots and lots of them. All told, I had an excellent
                    education, made some excellent friends, and hated that four years with a
                    passion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you hate it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LONG: Well, I thought I was Southern, coming from Florida, which back then was
                    still Southern. I didn't realize that Florida was not Southern in the way that
                    North Carolina was Southern. I was impatient with the mores, which were very
                    high bound, very pied-piperisyou know, follow the leadeunwritten rules and all
                    of that. I think it would have been a great place for somebody from the North or
                    somebody from the Midwest to go, because they could have gotten some things that
                    were wonderful about the culture of the school. The people who grew up there
                    already knew them and didn't need them, and I had grown up sort of with them but
                    smarted under the intellectual smugness, I guess you would say. There was almost
                    like a political correctnesthat's too a harsh a term for these days, but there
                    was a correct way of looking at things. I remember one time one of my professors
                    talking to my dad and he was trying to say something nice about mI made A's in
                    his course, toand he said, “Well, they'll never pour David in a mold,” and that
                    was supposed to sound like it was a compliment, but it wasn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a Presbyterian mold that they were trying to use,
                        or was it more sort of a Southern aristocratic mold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, aristocratic is the wrong word, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: The culture, yes. People have studied Southern culture and it's a very
                    complicated thing, but certainly the aristocratic past has influenced the South
                    like no other here, so there is a sort of a noblesse oblige, there is a sort of
                    a thing of honor. We had an honor system and it worked and it still does. There
                    was a civility. There were a lot of things that I frankly now miss, living in
                    the DC area. So it wasn't that I was a critic of the behavior as much as I felt
                    straight-jacketed by it. It was also all men; there were no women. I liked
                    girls, and it was almost like being in a monastery.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: We left every weekend, and I quickly realized, having no moneI had a full
                    scholarshiI got myself elected the social chairman of a fraternity. Now, in the
                    fraternities there you didn't live in a fraternity. It's a little boys' school,
                    so you live in a dormitory and the fraternities were really eating houses. The
                    social life really was nonexistent except for, I think, they had three dances a
                    year and stuff like that. So basically as social chairman I had an address book
                    by girls' school, not by name, and everybody would come to me, “Hey, can you get
                    us dates at 'fill in the blank' college, and I'd call up Susie Mae or somebody
                    and say, “There are three of us, four of us or whatever. Can you get us dates?”
                    Davidson was a place that girls all over the region wanted...</p>

                    somebody just to meet other people. So that's what I did, and every weekend we
                    left campus. They didn't even serve dinner on Saturday night. They didn't even
                    want you to be on campus, because they were afraid you'd turn into sort of a
                    gnome or something.</p>

                        Did that hit Davidson, or had Davidson already made its accommodations, or
                        how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, the act took a while to do, and it didn't really hit Davidson, I
                    don't think. I think far more meaningful from any student's idea was the Civil
                    Rights Movement, which was the early '60s. Chapel Hill was one of the places the
                    sit-in movement started, and I think that raised consciousness far more than the
                    '54 ruling.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: There were the beginnings of it, and it was still more of an intellectual

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Oh, they took a stand. The Southern Presbyterian Church took a stand
                    against segregation years before. People don't realize that, but the Church
                    itselI forget when but it was before World War II, it was way bacno, it wasn't
                    institutionalized in the Church. Then again, I think people madmake stila grave
                    error in interpreting institutionalized pronouncements with social acceptance.
                    You cannot legislate social acceptance, and it takes a lot longer for it to
                    occur than it does just to pass a law. I don't mean judgmentally in one way or
                    the other. It's something that takes time. Having spent most of my career in the
                    Middle East, all this stuff about democratizatiowave a wand and create a
                    legislaturis not going to create what we consider democratization.</p>

                        the middle of North Carolina. Did the outer world, particularly the
                        international world, intrude much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LONG: Not very much. It did for me. I was interested in it, and I was very
                    fortunate. I was actually very fortunate on a number of counts at Davidson. We
                    had two years of Bible, one Old Testament, one New Testament, and it turned out
                    to be among the best courses I had at school, because I learned more about
                    American culture in those courses. Most Americans have no inkling, particularly
                    ACLU. Even when they talk about separation of church and state, they don't
                    really have an inkling of how mucI'm not talking about theology here; I'm
                    talking about cultural anthropologthe Judeo-Christian heritage has molded our
                    society. When you start getting into Old Testament and New Testament, you find
                    out just how much our culture is based on this thing. Secondly, I had a
                    certifiable nut case. My freshman year he was a visiting professor. He had four
                    or five doctorates, and he was among other things an archeologist of the Middle
                    East. He really taught us more about archeology of the Old Testament than he did
                    about the kings of Israel and all that stuff, which I was vastly uninterested
                    in. That gave me my first interest in the Middle East. I remember one of the
                    things he said was that the reason that the Hebrews didn't have chariots and the
                    Philistines did is because the Philistines lived down on the plain where you
                    could run chariots, and up in the hills you'd run the wheels off these things
                    because it was too rocky. Well, this is exactly the same explanation for why the
                    largest tank battle in the world happened in the Sinai and up in the Golan
                    Heights they didn't have any tanks. Why? Because if you ran tanks up on the
                    Golan Heights, they would run the treads off the tanks. Down in the sandy land
                    of the Sinai, the Egyptians and the Israelis were going at it full blast with
                    all these tanks. It's fascinating some of the things that we learn. I got far
                    more out of looking at it from an archeological point of view, I think, than I
                    would have from a theological point of view. In the New Testament Bible we had a
                    pop quiz early on and I flunked it flat because I hadn't read the assignment.
                    The professor said, “See me,” so I went into his office and he wanted an
                    explanation. I said, “Well, outside the God squad” which is what we called the
                    preministerial students"I'm probably the only person that has any intellectual
                    interest in this subject at all” it was a required course; you had to take iand
                    I said, “I think this text” which was written by some British divine of the
                    Methodist persuasio“is just god-awful.” I said, “It's the boringest book I've
                    ever read,” and he looked at me for a minute and said, “I agree with you, but
                    I'm a junior professor and that's what the department head said we were going to
                    have, but I'll challenge you. I'll give you a tutorial, but you have to come to
                    class, you can't tell anybody. We have a honor system, so when you have a pop
                    quiz or midterm you just fold your paper over and write the honor code and hand
                    it in. But I'll give you a tutorial if you think you can handle it.” I said,
                    “Sure, I can.” It was a fantastic because he taught me all this stuff that he'd
                    been dying to teach people and couldn't, and it wasn't all New Testament, which
                    I got out of basically auditing the course. We read Reinhold Niebuhr and Martin
                    Buber and Jacques Maritain and Ernest Renan and all these guys that was itching
                    to teach somebody about. I basically got a modern theology and philosophy of
                    religion course tutorial, and we spent once a week together. It was supposed to
                    be two hours but we'd do two or three hours and have coffee. It was really
                    intellectually one of the best courses I ever had in my life. It was all done
                    sub rosa, because the gray-beards of the college administration would have
                    absolutely had a fit if they'd known we were doing it. It was pure luck. In
                    political science a CIA guy came down for one year and he was deciding whether
                    he wanted to teach full-time, and he taught us political science. I was a
                    history major because the political science department was a joke, but he was
                    there so I took this political science course, and it was a fantastic course. He
                    decided not to stay at Davidson because he was at a little tea party and he
                    asked this little old lady if she were a native. She said, “No, I'm from Iredell
                    County,” which is about 300 yards up the road, the county line, from where we
                    were. He thought, 'I'd better get back....' So I consider those three courseI
                    had a lot of other good courses, but those really influenced me. The Old
                    Testament, in learning about the Middle Easnot particularly much about the Old
                    Testament except for archeologthe New Testament, by just being an intellectually
                    expanding course, and the political science, which was taught by a guy who
                    actually became a very senior guy in the DDI, an analyst, and was on the Hill a
                    number of years ago, named Ford, a wonderful fellow: those were very influential
                    in getting me where I got.</p>

                <p>LONG: I didn't know. I was sort of formulating getting a doctorate and being a

                    scholarships, but I couldn't afford that. I really was sort of self sustaining,
                    and Chapel Hill offered me $1,500 and free tuition and books. So that's the one

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Political science. I had decided by that time I liked political science and
                    I had decided against law. I had thought I was going to be a lawyer and go back
                    to Florida and have a sailboat. I was interested in the Middle East and I took
                    some Middle East courses at Carolina but along with a lot of other stuff, a lot
                    of economics. I needed a thesis and I wanted to do it on the Middle East. The
                    Sudan wasn't terribly well plowed territory. All the documents were in English,
                    but it was the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and I figured here's something I can do and
                    I won't have to read French and Spanish and German, all the docs are going to be
                    in English. So I did it and I wrote a dissertation, or master's thesis, on the
                    Sudan. So later on when I joined the Foreign Service and they asked me where I
                    wanted to go, I said I'd like to go there because I'd never been there, and they
                    were not falling all over each other in line to get there, and they said, “Okay,
                    you want to go, you go,” and so I went.</p>

                <p>LONG: '61, and then they changed the ruleI was going for a doctoratand said you
                    had to have either public administration or state and local government as one of
                    your fields to get a doctorate in political science. I was by this time an IR
                    guy, an international relations person, and the idea of taking state and local
                    government or public administration totally turned me off. So I applied to the
                    Fletcher School at Tufts and got a scholarship and went to Fletcher, '61-'62,
                    and actually the grounding that I had gotten at Carolina made Fletcher a breeze.
                    Fletcher was a great experience but I didn't feel it was terribly academic, so I
                    went down to Harvard and said, “How about it, you guys? Could I get a degree and
                    really concentrate on the Middle East?” because by this time it had sort of
                    evolved. There was no decision but it sort of evolved. They said, “Sure.” They
                    looked at my record, and it was easier back then than now, and they said, “Yes,
                    we'll make you TA (teaching assistant).” I said, “Well, how long do you think it
                    will be, ballpark figure, to get through the comps?” They said, “Oh, four, five
                    years.” I thought of four or five years of Boston winters, and I already had two
                    degrees and three years of graduate school. So my roommate, who came from
                    Chicago, and I had been interviewed by Continental Illinois Bank. They had just
                    passed the Edge Act which allowed for off-shore banking, the first time for
                    American banks, Chase and Citicorp. Back in America in those days you did
                    correspondent banking and they had people but it was not widely done, so I
                    thought this would be great to get in on the ground floor. They called me up and
                    said, “We can't fly you out here,” and I said, “Why not?” They said, “Well,
                    you're from the South.” “So?” He said, “Well, personnel doesn't hire anybody
                    from the South because everybody that gets hired from the South, after about
                    three Chicago winters, goes home. It's not cost effective.” I said, “But I'm not
                    going to be in Chicago. I'm starting this international branch and we'll deal
                    all over the world.” He said, “I know, but they don't because we don't have it
                    yet and they're very domestic oriented.” I was sitting around drinking a beer
                    with my roommate, who had gotten an offer from theand we had all taken the
                    Foreign Service exam because everybody at Fletcher, all the Americans, diand we
                    said, “Well what the heck. Let's go join the Foreign Service.” “All right.” And
                    that's how I got in the Foreign Service.</p>

                    because I guess as a preacher's kid I knew what oral interviews were all about.
                    I knew I had to do something to turn this thing around and take charge of the
                    interview. Also, my heart wasn't in my hand because I hadn't intended to go into

                    I had to do something to sort of seize control psychologically of this thing.
                    Somebody asked me a questioI've always tried since then to remember the story
                    and I couldn'but it reminded me of this hysterical story, and I said, “That
                    reminds me of a story. May I tell it?” These guys in their three-piece suits
                    were sort of looking down their glasses at me, and the chairman said, “Well,
                    yes” and so I told this story and it cracked them up. You could see even he was
                    trying to keep his mean demeanor, and the others just cracked up. That enabled
                    me to take control of the interview, and I'm convinced that, had I not done
                    that, I would not have passed. It was like that question about Roosevelt and
                    Truman, and I got all balled up. I do that. I'm a history major but I wasn't
                    very good at dates. So, yes, I remember my oral very well. And I passed. In
                    those days they came out and told you right then whether you passed. And I said,
                    “Oh, good,” and the guy who was the chairman was irritated. I'm sure he wanted
                    to vote against me because I didn't jump up and do cartwheels. He said, “You
                    don't seem to be very excited.” I said, “Well, I'm not an outwardly emotive

                    kids, a lot of very outstanding people. There was one fellow who was from
                    somewhere in Scandinavia. He was to be the proctor of the dorm, and he tried to
                    run it like he was the headmaster of a prep school. I remember he called my
                    roommate and me in for something, an infraction, and started threatening us with
                    this very serious offense. If we didn't tow the line, there would be serious
                    consequences. We basically told him where he could go with his threats, that
                    “this is a graduate school, this is not a prep school, and this is absolute
                    nonsense, so don't call us, we'll call you,” and if he had any more to say, we
                    would say it in front of the dean; and he collapsed, in terms of a threat. It
                    was interesting, and it was a lesson learned, that very often peopland it's true
                    in diplomacy towho will try to bully you, and if they get away with it, then
                    they keep it going, and if you call them on it, they'll absolutely fade into the
                    woodwork. But that's not the experience of Fletcher. Fletcher was a tremendous
                    experience. I had a great time, and people who've done well since and who are
                    very well known, now it's fascinating remembering them back then. I saw an
                    article in The Economist by Fred Bergsten the other day. You may know Fred. He's
                    an economist and runs a little think tank here in Washington, the most
                    competitive guy I've ever met both physically and athletically and every other
                    way. He organized Fletcher School to be in the intramural program with Tufts.
                    You know, we were graduate students and we didn't take that very seriously. He
                    did. He had all this lined up. When we did football, he had football plays. And
                    we won the trophy of trophies. It was coming down to the wire and there was some
                    jock fraternity that was a little ahead of us. The last ones were done during
                    exam period, and I remember one of them was wrestling and he wanted to field a
                    whole team in wrestling. He asked me if I would wrestle. I said, “Heck no.” He
                    said, “Listen, nobody will challenge you because they're all studying for
                    exams.” I said, “If you can promise that nobody will challenge me, I'll do it,”
                    so I did. And in whatever my weight class was, I was the champion intramural
                    wrestler of Tufts University because I was unopposed, and we won the trophy of
                    trophies. So my roommate and I made this big, huge trophit was all a spoof, it
                    was all in good fuand a couple of faculty members heard about it and came down
                    to see this award. But that's the way it was. It was lots of fun and very
                    stimulating and very, very bright people. It was a very enjoyable year. It was
                    not academic; it was a professional school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pointed at anything by this time? Were you
                        looking at the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, I was pointed at the Middle East but I still wanted a doctorate and I
                    still wanted to teach. I had left Chapel Hill because I didn't want to do state
                    and local and public administration, I wanted to do international relations.
                    This was the top international relations school in the country along with SAIS
                    of Johns Hopkins. It was rigorous but more professional, and I wanted a more
                    academic doctorate and that's why I went to Harvard. When I took stock of how
                    long it would take me to start again, that's when, as I said earlier, we were
                    sitting around deciding what to do and Plan B was maybe go into banking, and for
                    me Plan C was the Foreign Service and I ended up with Plan C.</p>

                <p>LONG: Pretty good. The best and the brightest don't teach A100 to newly inducted
                    Foreign Service Officers at FSI, they're off being ambassadors and things, and I
                    realize that. I'm not besmirching them in any way, but they weren't the leading
                    edge of the talent bank of the Foreign Service. I realize also that people got a
                    lot of baggage very quickly and if you made it or didn't make it was not a sign
                    of lack or presence of ability as much as attitude. I learned that very quickly,
                    not that I took advantage of what I knew, but I learned that. Now, the quality
                    of instruction, sure it's good, but it wasn't very difficult not to be.</p>

                <p>LONG: I took conversational Arabic for six months, and then they didn't have
                    anything to do with it. There were a lot of us, but there were all these
                    positions that nobody could come and do them. It was a nightmare for Personnel.
                    Two of the most formatively important assignments I ever had took place in that
                    six months. One, the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, one of the
                    very few that we have ever had that was really, really gooI can't remember his
                    name nohe poked up his program where incoming FSOs could go up to him. So I
                    raised my handidn't have anything else to dand went up and worked for about for
                    about four months for Sam Gibbons, who was my Congressman from Tampa. It was a
                    fascinating experience. Every FSO should do it. It really gave me a feel for how
                    the Hill works that visitors simply don't have. Then when I came back, the
                    fellow who was in what was then known was POD, Personnel Operations Department,
                    which was the assignments guys, died suddenly and tragically, and the guy who
                    was to take his place couldn't come from overseas. So here was this brand newly
                    minted guy, and they said, “You're going to do Africa until he can get over
                    here.” So for about two months I did, and that taught me how the Foreign Service
                    really worked. We assigned everybody from DCM down. The ambassadors obviously
                    are picked in a different system. But here's this brand new guy who is arguing
                    for bodieof course, AF wasn't a bureau then, it was still with NEA. But in
                    Personnel there was an AF Bureaand I was the guy trying to get the best I could,
                    and everybody was trying to steal our best guys and nobody wanted to give them
                    to us. We had a modicum of real Africanists and then we had to beg, borrow and
                    steal the rest, whereas, say, EUR had their Europeanists and then everybody else
                    is trying to get in there. So the negotiating conditions were not good for AF,
                    and you really had to bargain hard. It gave me insight on how this thing really
                    works. I did that for about two months. We were trading bodies and everybody was
                    trying to unload, shall we say, their unproductive officers or less productive
                    officers on me, and I was trying to sell this guy as the greatest thing since
                    sliced bread to them and they all knew he was a dog and that was why nobody
                    wanted him, and on and on and on. So I learned more about personnel than some
                    people learn in 20 years, because if you're in the political or economic cone
                    you're so busy doing political and economic work. Personnel is what the admin
                    people do. Well, to their peril do they not know. I learned very early and, as I
                    said earlier, with my PK cynicism I started learning how this operation worked,
                    and it was a fascinating education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in the early days. Was there developing a good
                        solid core of Africanists?</hi>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LONG: Somebody ought to do a history about this one. I wouldn't say soliwell,
                    solid in quality but not in quantity. For one thing, with older guys, if you'd
                    spent 10 years in ARA and you know Spanish, you're not going to give up that
                    legacy and you're sort of inducted into the ARA priesthood and you know Latin
                    America, and start from scratch over here. So there are nonsubstantive career
                    reasons why this wouldn't necessarily be a good idea, unless you were just
                    totally fed up, and so you got people that were fed up. But the people from the
                    beginning who wanted to do it, yes, there were a bunch of people coming in or
                    who had just come in or who hadn't been branded with a bureau persona so that
                    they could do it, and that's where you got them. So it took a longer period of
                    time for them to come in and have a few tourmy roommate was one of theto become
                    the Africa hands. I think this is natural. It takes time when you open up a new
                    thing like that. But at the same timSoapy Williams was the Assistant Secretary
                    of Statit was absolutely incredible. He played the Administration, which was the
                    Kennedy Administration, like a violin, and all of the hopes and the idealism for
                    “this newly freed-from-imperialism-continent, and we are doing to do great
                    things.” One of the most talented group of people ever put together under Soapy
                    was there, and Sudan was in AF, it was not in Near East. Of course, the idealism
                    reigned over the realism because problems were not problems that you could just
                    have a quick fix for and they're still searching, but nobody has ever really, in
                    my opinion, done a real academic research paper on this extraordinary group of
                    people who in the early '60s were forming as the African countries were getting
                    independence. There was just a lot of talent running around out there. Some
                    stayed, others drifted on somewhere else. Some were political appointees. I'm
                    talking about the whole group at AF, but it was an extraordinary...</p>

                    then he went to the Sudan and from the Sudan he went on to South Africa and then
                    to Brazil. He was a lovely person, a very shy person. I always thought he was
                    miscast in the Sudan for his talent. He was a tremendous guy, but this was the
                    frontier. I'm sure he did a marvelous job in Brazil and in South Africa. I liked

                </p>
                <p>LONG: I'd never been there, so I had a lot of book learning but I didn't have the
                    touch and the smell and the feel. A Fletcher classmate of mine was the Assistant
                    Director of the Department of Statistics for the Sudan government, which was not
                    Cabinet but it was a fairly high civil service rank, and through him I met all
                    kind of people. I was out meeting folks and reporting all sorts of stuff, and a
                    lot of the people in the embassy read the newspaper and were sort of desk FSOs.
                    As my first assignment I was to be the consular officer. I was supposed to be
                    rotated after three months, but the guy who would have to come back from the
                    economics section made sure that I was going to stay there until he was rotated
                    out of Khartoum, so I stayed there not quite a year. But I used that period,
                    since it wasn't a heavy consular load, just to go out and meet people, know
                    folks, so I knew lots and lots of people. I had a great time there. Then they
                    had a civil war and they had a revolution and a lot of stuff like that.</p>

                <p>LONG: Well, this is me talking, this is oral history, this is not official. I
                    felt that probably it was a residue of the high hopeI won't say 'residue'
                    because they were still very much in evidencfor the newly freed continent. We
                    were doing a lot of stuff there. The AID mission was one of the biggest in the
                    world, and they were going to eradicate water hyacinths from the Nilgood lucand
                    we had all sorts of stuff going. I never really had a sense that we had much in
                    terms of interest there at all except as a part of the new rising continent.
                    That more or less wasn't challenged during my tenure. There were a lot of things
                    that happened previously. It was run by a military government under a guy named
                    Abboud, who was a lieutenant general; it was a bunch of generals that ran the
                    government. And then the government fell...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: While we were there, yes. There was a revolution, and during that
                    revolution there was some bloodshed but not nearly as much as when there had
                    been a north-south conflict. The southerners are African and the Northerners are
                    Arab. They're all dark skinned so it's hard to tell them apart if you come from
                    the United States. We had a civil rights guy who came out there to talk to the
                    brothers, and he was talking to these Arabs and didn't realize they were
                    probably more prejudiced than he was. They didn't look that way to him, but
                    there is an ethnic distinction between the largely animists and some Christians
                    in the south and Muslims in the north. There was an uprising along confessional,
                    quasi-confessional lines, and then there was also a revolution. So there was a
                    lot of upheaval, and out of that came a democratic government, but it never
                    really made it. After I left, it was overthrown again, and they had a series of
                    overthrows, of violent revolutions, which has always, I think, been a tragedy.
                    But in terms of US interests other than furthering this struggling country,
                    which is an interest of ours, and furthering democratization, although we had
                    never heard of the term, I can't say we had any pressing interest there at
                    all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a time when Nasser was riding high in Egypt. In

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LONG: They had sort of a love-hate relationship with Nasser, with Egyptians. It
                    was the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and the Egyptians looked down on Sudanese as
                    jungle people, way down, and they took offense at that. On the other hand,
                    Nasser was an incredibly charismatic person. But it's interesting: there is a
                    branch of the University of Cairo in Khartouand to get from point A to point B
                    you'd go by way of D, C, E, F, and X and Y and Z, the Egyptians, and they're
                    always being caught out by the Sudanese, who go from A to B by way of A to B,
                    and they couldn't figure out how come. It was because these guys are not as
                    conspiratorial as they are. So there was this relationship. They really weren't
                    under the spell of Nasser except as an individual and charismatic leader. But
                    the Egyptianness was looked as much as imperialism as anything else. In fact,
                    the memories of the British, although they were frustrated with imperialism,
                    were by and large positive.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: They had a first-rate university, Khartoum University. They had a
                    first-rate civil service. They just, once they got independent, have not really
                    had the ability to run themselves. It's a tragedy. And they still haven't, in my
                    opinion, up to now. They've had a lot of trouble governing themselves, but they
                    were left a darn good infrastructure with this university and this civil
                    service. It's a tragic country in that they had so much going for them when they

                <p>LONG: There were a lot of them in Khartoum. I knew a lot of them. But one of the
                    things that was fantastic for me: the ambassador we had previous to Ambassador
                    Rountree traveled all over that country. The country is as big as the United
                    States east of the Mississippi River, a big country, and he had this huge travel
                    budget. I was always bugging the DCM for orientation trips, and he'd basically
                    say, “FSOs are supposed to be seen, not heard. When they're your rank, shut up”
                    not literally but that was the message. All of a sudden one day the
                    administrative officer came in and said, “David, how would you like to take some
                    trips?” I said, “I'd love to. That's why I joined the Foreign Service.” He said,
                    “I've been having a staff meeting with the ambassador and I pointed out that if
                    we don't use up our travel money, we're going to lose it.” Most of the people in
                    the embassy at the time were sort of deskbound types, and nobody really wanted
                    to get out there much except me. So the DCM called me up, he wanted me to grovel
                    and be so thankful because they have decided as a special favor to me to let me
                    take these trips. I had already known from the administrative officer they were
                    doing this because they didn't want to lose the travel money, but I groveled
                    anyway. I had some marvelous trips. I went all over that country. I went all
                    over the place and just had a wonderful time. I wrote up all these reports that
                    I'm sure were never read by anyone. I've still got copies of some of them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: In the early days work was still running fairly well, but then when the
                    north-south thing blew up.... The civil war really started in the late '50s and
                    early '60s and is still going on.</p>

                <p>LONG: It had quieted down. There wasn't any travel advisory or anything. No, it
                    was quiet, but the underneath tension was there and boiled over subsequently in
                    violence. When I went on these trips, there wasn't that much violence, there
                    wasn't any. It was very quiet but you could sense, in the south particularly,
                    the tension. I also went out to the west, which hardly anybody had gotten out to
                    since the British. That was a different thing but very fascinating.</p>

                <p>LONG: There were early on, and then they were all sent out. They didn't close
                    down the missions, but they forced all of the foreign missionaries to leave,
                    which was probably a mistake, because if there were a moderating influence in
                    the south, it was these people. But again, this was ethnic, this was
                    confessional. It's a very complicated situation, and I'm not sure whether our
                    lack of interest or our overwhelming interest would have been a greater factor
                    in understanding the country better, I'm not sure either one. I'm talking about
                    Washington. The people out there did, sure.</p>

                        there would be much more interest in Ghana or Tanzania or what have
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, as I said, this was all caught up in the enthusiasm of Soapy
                    Williams, and it was still under that aura when I got there. The ethnic wars and
                    the revolution made it a crisis area. Of course, when there's a crisis area,
                    then there's a lot of attention placed on it. But by the time I left, I think,
                    the bloom was off the rose. It's hard to say, though, because the bloom was off
                    Africa. You don't sort of see it one day and it's gone the next. This is
                    something that you see in retrospect more than you see at the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that the Sudanese really aren't doing
                        the right things as far as running the government at this point, or were we
                        still seeing the better side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: This is just a prejudice of mine. I think we were less judgmental in
                    general back then than we are now. I personally decry the term
                    'democratization.' I think when you say 'democratization' subconsciously we
                    think everybody ought to be a Jeffersonian Democrat. In fact, what we're really
                    talking about is public participation in the political process, how does the
                    public participate, to what degree are they allowed to participate, how
                    effective are they and so forth. I think that by reducing this to little terms
                    like 'democratization' we have oversimplified and made simplistic some pretty
                    complicated things, and we don't have to think much anymore because we have a
                    little slogan that we can use. I think that that has increased particularly in
                    the last 10 years, and if you go back 30 years we were less judgmental. I think
                    the people that worked in these areas obviously were highly aware of it. We were
                    trying to look at the country for what it was through the eyes of the people
                    that were there and see what we could do to help rather than judging where they
                    stood on the scale of human rights or democracy or whatever else. I don't think
                    it was out of ignorance, I just think it was less judgmental.</p>

                    One time I was running around checking out the revolution and a mob started
                    chasing me. If I'd been timed by the Olympic timekeeper, I would have probably
                    won a world record.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, it was a mob. Another time I called up my friend Sillaman, the
                    statistician, and I said, “How are things in your suburb?” He said they were
                    quiet and they were quiet in mine, so I induced my wife to go with me around to
                    Sillaman's house. We were going to go way around, not through town, which was
                    kind of hopping. I guess this was during the ethnic uprising. The mob surrounded
                    us and were jumping up and down on the car. They'd been burning cars and houses
                    and things. This big face stuck into the window and they were all yelling, “Ai
                    shishab, long live the people.” I have a very loud voice and I was yelling even
                    louder, and he said, “Are you for the people?” I said, “Yes, I'm for the
                    people.” He turned around like Moses and said, “Stop,” and they all stopped. He
                    said, “He's for the people,” and I said, “I'm for the people,” and they all
                    started cheering. He said, “Let him by,” and they opened up like the Red Sea,
                    and we drove down this corridor of cheering people, “Ai Shishab, aywa!” I got
                    about two blocks down the road and had to pull over. I'd just turned to jelly.
                    It didn't happen during the incident but after, and my wife has never let me
                    forget it.</p>

                <p>LONG: I met her in Chapel Hill. Then I went to Fletcher, and then when I joined
                    the Foreign Service we had to decide whether to get married for her to go to
                    Sudan or wait till I got home. I said, “Your call. I can't guarantee how I'll
                    feel when I come home. As of this moment I am 100 percent sure that we'll get
                    married when I come home, but who knows what will happen when we're separated
                    for that length of time.” She very hesitantly said, “Okay, we'll get married.”

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, it's not so much climate, it's society. She was by 10 years the
                    youngest wife in the embassy. The next youngest wife was about 30 with three
                    kids. She was 22. She skipped a grade, so she was a year younger. She graduated
                    from college at 19 and she was going to Columbia Teachers College when she went
                    overseas. A young married person with no children and the youngest American wife
                    with three kids, that's tough. And then, of course, it's a male society. If
                    you're going to learn how to go with the locals in the Arab world, you've got to
                    be able to stay up all night long and drink tea with the men, which I did, and
                    it was tough on her, very, very tough.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: This was language. I had taken six months of colloquial Arabic, and the
                    colloquial Arabic that they teach here is Lebanese. I went back for the full
                    course. A full course of Arabic at FSI is 22 months, so I went to the Western
                    Arabic Language School for the rest of that. I was supposed to pick up western
                    dialect; I had the eastern dialect plus the Pusshah, which is the educated,
                    literate language. I had a wonderful time learning Arabic.</p>

                    broke taking advantage of all the opportunities. We had our first child born in
                    Daytona Beach just before we left. But Barbara could get a lady to come in and
                    help her, and it was very nice.</p>

                        was set to teach western Arabic, that it didn't quite reach sort of the
                        standards of effectiveness on the one in Beirut. What was your

                </p>
                <p>LONG: When you say effectiveness, that's a far more complicated question than
                    maybe you think you've asked. In Beirut they learn Lebanese, and to my way of
                    thinking Lebanese is not the language you ought to learn or the dialect you
                    ought to learn. Back in that day and time you should have learned Egyptian or,
                    as we say, Egyptiantheir 'j' they pronounce 'ga' instead of 'ja', so you know
                    it's an Egyptian if he says 'ga' because there is no hard 'ga' sound in Arabic.
                    So Gamal Apanasa is really Jamal Apanasa in classical. At any rate, that was the
                    dialect that everybody knew. That was the dialect of Radio Cairo, of Satal Arab,
                    blah, blah, blah, and they learned Lebanese. Having taken all this Arabic here
                    and it was Lebanese, and I went to Khartoum, the first day I was in Khartoum I
                    was in a taxi and I wanted the guy to stop at the embassy, so I said, “ wokte
                    lehone,” which meant 'stop here', and he kept driving and went by, because the
                    word ' wokte ' is in classical 'wokte, but the Lebanese pronounce a 'ka' like a
                    hiccup, so instead of saying 'wokte ' they say 'wokef'. Then the 'le' on the end
                    of ' wokef ' means 'for me', 'stop for me'; 'hone' means 'here', and the
                    classical is 'huna', so they say, “hone” but everybody else says, “hene.” In
                    Sudanese, that would be 'inaudible'. When I said, “hone,” he probably knew what
                    I was saying, but he didn't stop. The dialect just is not widely enough used,
                    and when it is and it's Lebanese, it's not the most popular dialect in the east.
                    So even if the eastern school were excellent, which it was, I have always had my
                    doubts whether it should have been in Beirut learning Lebanese. They should have
                    learned something. Anyway...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're in Tunisia now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, which is in the west. Certainly in Morocco you learn Moroccan. We
                    learned the dialect very well. But Moroccan dialect, even among the western
                    dialects, is pretty far away from the western dialects. So quite apart from the
                    quality of the instruction, you then have to ask yourself how useful was it. In
                    my case they sent me to Saudi Arabia where it was of no use, the western
                    dialect. Now, I learned the Pusshah. All the newspapers are in Pusshah, which is
                    standard all over the Middle East. But for the spoken dialect I basically had to
                    go back and resurrect my Sudanese, which was an overlay of my Lebanese, and then
                    put in Saudi vocabulary and sounds to make it work. So from that point of view
                    it was a total waste of time to learn the western dialect, but the reason was
                    they thought I was going to be assigned somewhere in the Maghreb in the west,
                    and they needed somebody really quick to go to Jeddah. I went kicking and
                    screaming because, having spent all this time to learn the western dialecthis
                    was like learning Portuguese and being sent to Madribut then that's how life is
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>LONG: Actually I left in December of '66. We went to Beirut, and I had to be
                    retested again in Arabic because they didn't trust the testing over theryou
                    know, bureaucratics. Actually I did very well there, and then we took leave and
                    so I spent a couple of weeks in Beirut, which before they tore it up was a
                    beautiful place, and then we flew into Jeddah just after New Years in '67, so
                    the war had not happened yet.</p>

                    'ah' because it's sort of aspirated at the end.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LONG: One is about when we talked about the British. They had left and the
                    Sudanese are very proud people and did not shed any tears over regaining their
                    independence. That didn't mean to say that they did not have a warm spot in
                    their heart for the British. I mentioned earlier about the royal visits and how
                    they turned out in large numbers for their queen. One story involves attitudes
                    and habit factor. I was out in the western part of the country, out in Darfur,
                    which was about 600 or 700 miles from the capital. I was by myself actually in a
                    lorry driving around and inspecting the countryside and talking to local people
                    and getting attitudes and so forth. I stopped in a little town called Zalenja
                    where they had a UN experimental farm. I met a fellow there from Khartoum from
                    the Ministry of Agriculture, a friend of mine, and he asked me what I was doing
                    there and I asked him what he was doing there. For the couple of nights that I
                    was there we were together, and he asked me where my cook was, and I said, “I
                    don't have a cook. I'm just running around the country.” He was aghast that a
                    Western person would be running around out there without a cook. So the day I
                    lefwe left about six o'clock in the morning and it was still not quite sun-uI
                    was shooting for the pot. I was shooting game, and as soon as I shot a gazelle,
                    the people in the trucand I never knew who was in the truck because the guy who
                    was driving it around, one of his rights was that he could pick up passengers
                    for an extra bit of monethey would run out and slit the throat of the animal and
                    say, “inaudible,” bless it so that they could eat it by Islamic dietary laws. I
                    was thinking we're really now in the real unspoiled nature of the society out
                    here. When we stopped for lunch, this guy got out and cooked the meaand I hadn't
                    seen him beforand it was a fast lunch. So we moved on, and when we stopped for
                    dinner and campinwe were camping ouI wanted to sit down with the guys and see
                    what was happening. Usually on these occasions you'd see a little dot on the
                    desert and about 10 minutes later somebody would walk in and say, “inaudible”
                    and you'd look around and wonder where in the world did they come from, because
                    there's nothing out there in the desert, and how did they know we were here. By
                    the time the meal was cooked, there would be about four or five of them around
                    and we'd share our meal. Only this time it was the same guy, he was dressed in a
                    white djellaba and he had a cummerbund on, and he'd set up this little table
                    with a tablecloth on it. He found a case of scotch that I was giving to the
                    local officials in the little villages where I went, which is totally against
                    Islamic law, but they took it anyway. He'd found a bottle scotch and he had it
                    on the table facing the sunset, a gorgeous sunset. It was the cook. The fellow
                    from back in Zalenja, this Ministry of Agriculture fellow, had sent his cook
                    along with me because he couldn't stand to see this Westerner out there in the
                    desert without any cook. This was the Raj. I had never ever really before that,
                    or since actually, felt as close to 19th century history, sitting in solitary
                    splendor, not able to go and talk to the guy until I had my meal and a little
                    glass of scotch following it to top everything off, and then I could go and sit
                    around the campfire and talk to him. I was thinking, with all of the layers of
                    civilization that have come through in the Middle East and even come through the
                    Sudan, there is sort of a heartland area inside each individual and then there
                    are these layers, and one of the layers they had picked up from the British
                    imperial days and they stuck to it. It had nothing to do with their political
                    attitudes or their societal attitudes, but it was certainly there in spades and
                    I've never forgotten it.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Another instance I remember was during one of the revolutions we had. They had a
                    lot of unrest in the Sudan. I had made friends with the senior member of the
                    Sudanese Communist Party, much to the dismay of the intelligence people in our
                    embassy who didn't think I should be talking to the opposition, but I did
                    anyway. During the middle of one of the revolutions when they were trying to
                    burn down the American Embassy and his people were in the middle of trying to do
                    this, he called me up at my suburb. One of the things about revolutions in that
                    part of the world is the phone system never is torn up, so people can
                    communicate with each other; now I guess they use cell phones. At any rate he
                    was very concerned that I and my wife were safe while he was trying to burn down
                    my embassy. It's a great example of sort of the affirmization or
                    compartmentalization of attitudes in this part of the world. If you do not
                    account for it, you generally misinterpret what's happening politically in those
                    countries. His relationship with me was personal and he was very concerned about
                    my personal safety, whereas his political position was to run down all Americans
                    in the revolution and in violence. To a Westerner that would seem a total
                    disconnect, but he saw absolutely nothing that was untoward or strange about
                    this behavior.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: The same as they are, and nobody knows. The attitude, I think, in
                    Washington was, well, they can't eat their oil and they're going to have to sell
                    it to the West, so there's no reason to worry about this country since what else
                    can they do with their oil, it's not threatened. They're very religious and very
                    conservative, and there seemed to be virtually no Communist threat as seemed to
                    be, at least in the minds of Washington, rife in northern Arab states. So, yes,
                    they had all the normal concerns, but there was no sense of urgency and there
                    were no visitors to speak of. It was off the beaten track of Congressmen who
                    wanted to junket through the area and wanted to have Israel as their hub and
                    that they'd see Egypt or Lebanon or countries close to there, but they seldom if
                    ever got down to the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Herman Eilts operate as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I think that that generation of Arabists was unsurpassed and is still
                    unsurpassed in quality, in judgment, in depth of understanding and the ability
                    to deal with the problems of the area. When he became ambassador, I forget how
                    young he was. He was a relatively young person, and that was in the days when
                    you had to have white hair before you're considered for ambassador. He was a
                    tremendous fellow. He was also a workaholic, which is the key to success in the
                    Foreign Service. He thought that a good weekend would be spent going down to the
                    embassy and knocking off a dozen or so cables. I think cable traffic when he was
                    there quadrupled from his predecessor, and when he left I think it dropped about
                    a half. He was tremendous. The problem was trying to find something to write on
                    that he hadn't already grabbed up and written before you could get to it; not
                    because he was trying to undercut his staff but because he just was such a
                    dynamic fellow and had an intellectual curiosity to want to know everything that
                    was going on about everything everywhere, that it was hard to keep up with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is my question, and that is, as a political
                        officer in a two-man political section where they don't have elections and
                        they don't have loyal opposition, what the hell do you do and what do you
                        report on</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LONG: Actually that's a very good question. Most Foreign Service Officers think
                    that if they don't have elections and they don't have all the trappings of
                    government that we have, that nothing's going oquite the opposite. The problem
                    is if you don't know the systeand virtually nobody did know the system except
                    for the senior Arabists like Eiltit was very, very difficult to find out what
                    was going on. I went with my boss, Bob Stookey, to a lot of meetings where he
                    never opened his mouth, and he was criticized by visitors, the few that we ever
                    had, not Congressmen but usually FSOs, because they said he was too shy and
                    never talked to anybody. Well, you don't have to fill silent spaces with noise
                    in that society, and you can sit there for 45 minutes and not say a word and
                    it's not considered unseemly or rare or anything. In fact, they wonder why we
                    rattle on. I learned a heck of a lot about the culture under him. Then I went
                    out and decided if I tried to beat the ambassador I'm not going to do it. He's
                    the ambassador and he has access to people and information and cables from
                    Washington that say “Burn before reading” that I would never have, and,
                    therefore, why should I lead from my weakness to his strength. I went out to
                    find things that nobody was necessarily looking at at the time, which may or may
                    not have been marginal, but it kept me busy. I learned so much about the country
                    that academically I've followed the country ever since and have become, I guess,
                    probably one of the leading Western followers of Saudi Arabia.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LONG: One thing I did, for example, Ambassador Eilts asked if I would go out and
                    write a report about the hajj, which is the pilgrimage to Mecca. I think he
                    thought I'd write about a one-page thing where we had a hajj this year and so
                    many people came and this is what happened, it happens every year. There wasn't
                    that much demand on my time, so I went out. Jeddah is the gateway city of Mecca
                    transportation-wise, and they have a fascinating, sort of medieval guild system
                    for administering the hajj. What King Abdul Aziz ibn Faisal Saud did when he
                    took over the Hejaz, the western region, was he didn't create a government
                    bureaucracy to run the hajj, he basically grafted on this guild system. He
                    turned it into what in the United States would be sort of like a public utility,
                    a privately owned but nevertheless totally regulated utility, because the
                    government wouldn't have had the ability to do this anyway. So I met people that
                    were pilgrim guides; they were basically like religious tour leaders, very well
                    organized. In those days there were almost 1,000,00now there are over
                    2,000,00people that come every year, speaking about 120 languages and mostly
                    old, and you have to get these out of the seaport and the airport and over to
                    Mecca and around and about. You know, we couldn't even do Woodstock, and it's a
                    miraculous thing. So I studied it quite at length and wrote a 30-page
                    single-spaced paper on this, which I knew nobody in Washington would ever want
                    to read, but it became sort of a source document for anybody going to the
                    embassy being assigned there, because this was the major happening of the
                    country. We always thought of oil, but to however many billion Muslims there are
                    in the world the hajj is the most important thing. So I sort of became an
                    authority on this thing, and later on I finished my dissertation, I finished my
                    doctorate, and I needed a subject so I thought, hey, I've done all this
                    research, and I turned it into a dissertation. To this daand that was years and
                    years agI get questions on the hajj from scholars who are studying it, that I
                    have no idea what they're talking about because I haven't look at this thing in
                    25 years. That's one of the things that I did, and I did it in depth.
                    Fortunately I had a boss, Bob Stookey, who was sympathetic, because most Foreign
                    Service bosses would say, “What are you wasting your time doing this for? What
                    don't you do the busy work that is normal?” Well, busy work is busy work no
                    matter where you were. So I did stuff like that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: To a degree, but I think Washington was more worried than was Saudi Arabia.
                    This would be like sending John Paul II to the Vatican City for Easter. This is
                    such a high holy day that it would not be tolerated, not just by the Saudi
                    government but by the million hajjis that are there. In later years the Iranians
                    tried to disrupt, and they did thithis was after the revolution...</p>

                <p>LONG:... yes, righto try to demonstrate to the Muslim world that the Saudis
                    weren't fit to be the custodians of the hajj and that they, the Iranians, should
                    do it under the international committee. Well, it backfired totally, not because
                    of anything the Saudis did but because the Islamic world rose up at the
                    desecration by these Iranians. So, yes, that was a problem, just like crowd
                    control would be a problem on the mall on the 4th of July, but it didn't have
                    the dimensions that I think some people worried about because they didn't really
                    go into depth about what's happening here. The Soviets always did send a
                    delegation, but the Saudis were on them like white on rice and nothing ever came
                    of it.</p>

                        called it?</hi>

                        branches of the Saud family, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: No, this is one of the mysteries. How does the royal family operate? And
                    it's still largely a mystery. I was very fascinated with it and I did a lot of
                    study of it informally. I talked to a lot of people. Now, I didn't talk to the
                    important people, because I was too junior, because Saudis weren't all that
                    interested in talking to Americans. So there was sort of the regular group of
                    people that would come to the ambassador's parties, and he picked up some
                    contacts and they were senior enough. You always submitted the people that you
                    had at your parties to the protocol officer, who was myself because I was the
                    junior officer. At the next party out he'd be at the ambassador's, so why should
                    he come to my house when he could go to the ambassador's house? So I
                    concentrated on younger people. I met their uncles, who were older people. I met
                    a lot of people. It was very difficult to do, and I worked at that, but then I
                    had the time, everybody had the time. This didn't change, this was constant, but
                    the relationship changed in a major way after the '67 war, which happened in
                    June after I got there.</p>

                <p>LONG:...and the Arabs. Following that, the importance of Western-looking Arab
                    states became far more important. Many Arab states in that time broke relations
                    with us, and they were not restored for a number of years. It wasn't noticed
                    very much in the Foreign Service because as relations were restored, the more
                    senior people with a lot of experience in the Middle East went right back into
                    NEA, that's the Near East bureau, where they'd been all along. The junior
                    officers, such as myself, were so junior that it wasn't going to hurt us very
                    much to have a sort of gap there. In fact, because I was in Saudi Arabia and
                    then I went back to Washington, the gap didn't affect me anyway. But there were
                    a lot of junior middle-grade officers who got assignments in the Far East, in
                    Latin America, somewhere else, and had one or two assignments there. Then when
                    the Middle East opened up again, they had to decide, 'Well, gee, I've now sort
                    of gotten myself known in this bureau' and, as you know, the State Department
                    oversees this sort of group by area specialist more than functional
                    specialis'why should I start all over again and go back into NEA, because I
                    wasn't that senior there anyway, and why shouldn't I just stay here in Latin
                    America or in the Far East or Africa or somewhere else.' It's fascinating.
                    Nobody watched this except a few guys like me, I guess. I didn't do it
                    professionally, but I was interested in it. It was not until that older
                    generation started to retire that all of a sudden it was noticed that there was
                    an experience gap of senior officers. By this time we junior officers were
                    middle-grade officers. But with the senior officers there was a gap. Some of
                    them came in from South Asia, which was part of the Near East/South Asia Bureau,
                    but I think there was a definite quality gap. I'm not talking ad hominem here
                    but in terms of experience, which was further compounded by what I in my
                    personathis is certainly not scientific but my personajudgment is that about
                    that time process began to win out over substance in experience terms. I don't
                    think that the Near East has ever had the quality of people who were solid both
                    substantively and in procesand you have to have botas they were of that first
                    group of people. I think part of it had to do with the fact that after the June
                    war the junior middle-grade people who had to find an assignment out of the
                    Bureau and then never came back created a gap that wasn't really noticed until
                    years went by and they would have been the ones coming in to be DCMs and
                    ambassadors. Yes, there were people more junior to them, but people that came in
                    because they saw a nice ambassadorshinice ambassadorship meaning any
                    ambassadorshiwere long on process and short on substance.</p>

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>LONG: Process means how the system works, how the Foreign Service system works,
                    how the Washington system works, how the U.S. foreign affairs bureaucracy system
                    works and what you have to do to survive, to get ahead, what you have to do to
                    make a good record overseas, and all of these things, which are very important.
                    If you're naive, you're not going to make it nor should you, because you should
                    be aware of these things if you want to make an impact on policy. Substance
                    means how well do you know the local people, how well do you know the language,
                    the society, and how well do you understand really the politics that are going
                    on. I don't think that the people in NEA now can.... Certainly there are
                    individuals that, as in any period of time, are as good as you will ever find,
                    but in aggregate I do not think that the Near East specialists of today measure
                    up in their grasp of the region to the degree they did back then. But I think
                    that in terms of their grasp of how to treat the system to make the system work
                    for them, for America, for U.S. policy, they're probably far more
                    sophisticated.</p>

                        Saudi Arabia and our work there and all that? This was a devastating blow to
                        Egypt particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, it was one of these things that was more apparent in retrospect than
                    at the time, because the Saudis did not really involve themselves more than in a
                    token manner in that war. Life went on. However, the energy crisis was to come
                    soon thereafter, and this was sort of a hiatus period between the war and the
                    energy crisis. At the time of the war Arab radicalism was at its height. When
                    Nasser basically lost the war, you couldn't tell it at first but the charisma
                    that he haand he was one of the charismatic people, I think, in 20th century
                    politicthe air went out of him. There was nothing to take its place. In time we
                    discovered that what took its place, and what became the idiom for people to
                    express their discontent with whatever, became Islam. I don't mean Islam the
                    doctrine but the political Islamicism of today. That wasn't apparent immediately
                    among many Foreign Service Officers of that time. I used to argue with them.
                    They thought that nothing really had changed, that Arab nationalism was still at
                    the center of attitudes of dissent and attitudes of frustration against the
                    West, and so forth. At the time it was more with me a feeling than any real
                    empirical evidence to prove this. The war between Saudi Arabia and Yemen went on
                    throughout almost all of the '60s, and Nasser was keeping the war going by
                    supplying the Yemenis...</p>

                <p>LONG: Right, and after the '67 war he had to withdraw those both for the '67 war
                    and then because Egypt was militarily broken. It took another several years for
                    that war to wind down, so as that was happening, there was still a lot of
                    attitudes, both among the Saudis and the Americans, that Nasser was the big bad
                    guy. Well, but he was a shadow big bad guy and nobody knew it, at first because
                    there wasn't anything else there. So I think, at least in how I looked at it,
                    that the '67 war was a major watershed but it was not fully realized until three
                    to 15 years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting from your Saudi contacts a certain
                        dismissal of Nasser after the '67 war, because this was really his war, he
                        had made all the moves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: No, not a dismissal. He lost face, he was humiliated, but not a dismissal
                    because he was still Nasser. If you are concerned about people using an idiom to
                    express whatever discontenmaybe they didn't like their mother-in-law, whateveand
                    using the language of Arab socialism and all of this stuff, and the Soviets were
                    still there and they were still powerful, then this would be a concern. He sort
                    of was a symbol of the language and the symbology used by people who wanted to
                    be dissident, be against something, but he didn't rouse people and Islamicism
                    had not flowered. I wrote a piece back then saying that it was a bipolar world,
                    the East and the West. In Saudi Arabia particularly, because it's an Islamic
                    country and classical Islamic political theory is a bipolar world, the Dar al
                    Islam, the people under the law, under Islamic law, and Dar al harb, the people
                    of war, bipolar. The bad guys are the people of war. Now, I'm not saying that
                    they went and looked at the Koran to decide who was who, but this is sort of
                    like proper Bostonians think that the center of the cosmos is the golden dome of
                    the State House of Massachusetts. It's an internalized feeling. But nevertheless
                    the Saudi view was that America was Christian and we were people of The Book,
                    because Islam recognizes monotheistic religions including Christianity, Judaism
                    and actually Zoroastrianism, the Parsis. So we were maybe not first class but we
                    were people of the book against the people of war who were the Communists, who
                    were atheist. In that framework they could live with having good relations with
                    the United States. I said, “If you don't watch out, they're not going to look at
                    us as Christian people of The Book. They're going to look at us as secularist,
                    consumerist, nonreligious people and our status can quickly change to people of
                    dar al-harb, people of war.” I really think that that is what has happened among
                    the people who are dissident, the Islamist radicals. The interesting thing about
                    it is that one of the early authorities that Islamic terrorists read to this day
                    very carefully is the same guy who is the spiritual father of Wahhabism. It's
                    the same stuff. He lived 1,000 years ago, a guy named Ibn Taymiyyah. But it
                    shows you how attitudes can change but the structural framework, not that
                    they'll ever mention this. It's very internalized but it's there, and I think
                    that that shift from looking at the West as Christians against atheists in the
                    Soviet Union began then. And the final end of that model was with the end of the
                    Cold War, in which the members of the Dar al-Harb and wguess whaat least by the
                    extremists are considered no longer people of The Book but rather secularist,
                    atheist America.</p>

                <p>LONG: No. First of all, you didn't go into private people's homes very much.
                    Saudi Arabia is a closed society. Mutaythat's a big tribif they socialize
                    typically in some social function, 80 percent of the people there will be Mutayr
                    and the other 20 will be everybody else. If you go over to a guy who is an
                    Anayzah, same thing, and so forth. So they don't even interact socially all that
                    much among themselves. For them to mix with Europeans is very, very rare. I knew
                    some people and there were a few families that I got into homes, but many of my
                    colleagues, not just Americans but the Western diplomatic community, there were
                    some that during their entire tour had never been in a Saudi home. That was not
                    rare, that was the rule. About Nasser, no, I think that he captured their
                    imagination in the late '50s a little but, but particularly in the '60s and
                    particularly after the Yemen War started, no, because he was giving succor to
                    this Republican regime down there in Yemen that was a threat to Saudi Arabia.
                    Also, the Saudi concept of Arabism is different from those other people. To be
                    an Arab you have to be born one of a tribe that is Arabian that goes back to
                    God, and if you're not, you will never be one. That's a very different kind of
                    concept of Arab nationalism from what Nasser was selling. They were fascinated
                    by him earlier on, but after that I think no. I think the old attitudes toward
                    Egyptians, which is sort of said with a curl of the lip, continues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any positive appreciation of Israel, or was this
                        purely sort of a maligned country sitting out there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LONG: Nothing's pure. Behavior is so complicated. I think the tendency of
                    everybody is to try to simplify it, to bring it down to where it's
                    comprehensible to the human mind, but in my opinion never came to me to do this.
                    Their attitude toward Israel was as complicated as is ours, which is also very
                    complicated but for totally different reasons. First of all, Judaism is one of
                    the monotheistic religions that they recognize. They are people of the book and
                    they have a book. How do you square that with a total antipathy toward Zionism.
                    Well, you can honor the religion of Judaism and oppose a political doctrine of
                    Zionism, which is not even particularly religious. Now, you can call this a
                    rationalization, but nevertheless Zionism is really a political doctrine, not a
                    theological doctrine. So they would tell you what they oppose is Zionism. Now,
                    don't take that out to its logical conclusion and find an inconsistency, because
                    life is full of inconsistencies and, man, this is a big one, but that is sort of
                    how they would construct their opposition if you ask them. If you didn't ask
                    them, they were just against Israel, they were the enemy, just like we were
                    against the Japs and the Germans. But if you were to intellectualize it, this
                    would be probabland I've asked lots of people about this, and this is really
                    where we would end uZionism, which is trying to take over the Muslim world. Then
                    the other unique thing about these people, because it is such an Islamic
                    society, is that the third holiest site in Sunni Islam after Mecca and Medina is
                    Jerusalem. It's not the Mosque of Omar that they think is the third holiest
                    site; it's the al Aqsa Mosque, which is this little silver-domed job which sits
                    over on the side on the temple mount, not the dome of the rock, and that to
                    Sunnis is the third holiest site in Islam. So there is a religious element here
                    that transcends politics, and I don't think we've ever fully understood that
                    either. And then you would say, “Well, then how do they square that with the
                    fact that there are Palestinians that are Christian and not Muslim?” Well, they
                    don't, but this is the compartmentalization again that we talked about earlier.
                    But there is that religious element that the dome of the rock, no, but the al
                    Aqsa Mosque, yes, that being the third holiest site, that it to them must be
                    under Arab/Muslim sovereignty, and that's an element that some more secular Arab
                    states don't emphasize.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflections about King Hussein was
                        being viewed there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>LONG: Very negatively. I did temporary duty in Oman back in the '80s and I wrote
                    this piece about why the Saudis and Jordanians would never really get along
                    terribly well, and the ambassador was furious that I wrote this thing and
                    quashed it. So I just sent it in the surface pouch to people I wanted to read it
                    and let it go at that. But the thing is the Hashemites come from Mecca, and King
                    Hussein's great grandfather, if I've gotten my genealogy straight, was the
                    fellow in World War I, Sharif Hussein of Mecca. He ran Hejaz, which is the
                    western region of which Mecca was the capital, under the Ottoman Empire. Since
                    the Ottoman Empire didn't have any real military power to deploy in the Hejaz,
                    it was really quasi-independent. He was also very, very ambitious, and so he
                    signeyou remember, back with McMahon, the British officer in Egypthe McMahon
                    correspondence. He agreed to rebel against the Ottomans, which was a huge step
                    because the Ottoman sultan was also the caliph of Islam. If you're running
                    Mecca, you don't do that. That's like if you were a very devout Catholic, you
                    don't for totally political reasons decide, unless you're Henry VIII, to disavow
                    the Pope. That is a big step, and he did it. Then at the end of World War I he
                    declared himself King of the Hejaz. That irritated Ibn Saud over in Riyadh but
                    he didn't say anything because he didn't have any money and was being supported
                    in part by British subsidies. He knew that Hejaz was, because of Sharif
                    Hussein's, now King Hussein's, support of the British in World War I, was one of
                    their big buddies, so he didn't want to antagonize the British. But then when
                    Ataturk overthrew the Ottoman Empire, he also canceled the caliphate and said,
                    “We're not going to be caliph of this land anymore up here.” So King Hussein
                    self-appointed himself the caliph of all Muslims, and that was more than Ibn
                    Saud could take. So he invaded the place in the '20's and took over in 1925-26,
                    somewhere along there, his armies took over Hejaz, and that ended the Hashemite
                    rule in the Hejaz. But in the meantime the British, because they felt they owed
                    a debt to old Hussein, had made one of his sons King of Iraq; another one of his
                    sons, Faisal, was going to follow him to be King of the Hejaz; and then a third
                    son they didn't have any place for him, so they went out in the desert on the
                    other side of the Jordan and said, “We're going to call this Trans-Jordan so
                    that you can have someplace to run.” That is Jordan of these days. The son of
                    this guy, Abdullah, wasn't king material. His grandson was King Hussein. So
                    there's been bad blood between the Hashemites and the Al Saudis that go back to
                    this period. It has a lot to do with Islam, claiming you're caliph, running
                    Mecca and all this other stuff that very, very few Westerners know about. Back
                    in the Cold War we thought, well, Jordanians are anti-Communist and the Saudis
                    are anti-Communists, they ought to get together. In a pig's eye; they weren't
                    ever going to get together. I don't mean they would fight each other, no. Their
                    relations have always been correct, but there is very little love lost between
                    those two countries.</p>

                    cause. If he had not fought for the cause at all, they would have looked down on
                    that too. They do seek to assign blame and find scapegoats just like everybody
                    elsa human behavioral trait, I thinbut not in the way that we do. Yes, they
                    blamed him but I don't think they blamed him to the degree that if we'd been in

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>LONG: When King Faisal, then Crown Prince Faisal, became Prime Minister of Saudi
                    Arabia under King Saud, they stripped King Saud of his power. There were no more
                    than probably a half a dozen or so college graduates in Saudi Arabia. Zaki
                    Yamani, fabled Minister of Petroleum, was one of the earliest Western-educated
                    college graduates in the kingdom. By the time I got there in 1967, more and more
                    kids were being sent privately to Western universities, so there was a younger
                    generation that had more of them. But it really didn't take off until the energy
                    crisis and all the money that was flowing in. They sent thousands of kids to the
                    West in the '70s, and that is really the period where Western-trained and
                    Western-educated Saudis just really, really took off. There were thousands of
                    them on any given day in the United States. We had the largest number, but then
                    there were others in the UK, in France, in Germany, all over the place. Almost
                    all were on government scholarship by that time versus the families that were
                    sending their own. In the meantime they were building universities. King Saud
                    University, which was changed to Riyadh University and is now King Saud
                    University again, in Riyadh was started in the '50s. It was just chugging along,
                    and they basically hired whole faculties from the West. Then as Saudis came back
                    with PhD's they took their place, so there were virtually no expats there
                    anymore. What was called when I was there the Pet College, which was the College
                    of Petroleum and Minerals over in Dhahran, became King Faisal University, which
                    is their engineering and scientific university. Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah
                    was started as a private university, and the government took it over and
                    expanded it to a major university, and on and on. So the educational boom in
                    Saudi Arabia occurred really more in the '70s and came to fruition in the '80s
                    rather than in the '60s. People were worried that with all of these college
                    graduates coming back from Saudi Arabia, what were they going to do to find
                    jobs. In the early days you could go from college into a high government
                    position. Well, by the time everybody in the government had a college education,
                    then what were they going to do? Well, private business, which is taking most of
                    them even now. Everybody is in business; even government people are in business.
                    So worries that they had back then and they were beginning to have in the '60s
                    didn't come to fruition. Now, the other thing I think one should mention is that
                    they started a little moribunit started off moribund tothing called a Central
                    Planning Office. The idea was to have some sort of modicum of central planning.
                    Yamani and his deputy were two very, very powerful people, and it's hard to run
                    a ministry of petroleum with two such very hard-charging guys in it. So Yamani's
                    deputy was kind of shunted off by him to be the head of this. Well, he worked
                    this into a Ministry of Planning and he got Hisham Nazer and he got SRI,
                    Stanford Research Institution, to come over and do the first five-year plan,
                    which was not like a Soviet one. It was more of a wish list, but it gave a sense
                    of direction as to where they wanted to develop. They have had plans coming
                    regularly ever since that. Now again, you can't read this like a Communist
                    five-year plan, but it gave more direction than was going on before that. All
                    that came to maturity in the '70s also when they had all the money. That has
                    transformed the technological aspects of society in Saudi Arabia in a way that
                    back even in the late '60s was hard to find.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>LONG: Superficially yes. We assigned a little more urgency to our relations than
                    we had before. We took them for granted no more. All of a sudden we didn't have
                    that many friends in the Middle East. They were a very powerful friend, but the
                    relationship really did not change structurally until the energy crisis, for two
                    reasons. One, back when I was there the Israelis would tell Washington, “We want
                    you to have good relations with the Saudis. They have oil, and you should really
                    have good relations. And we don't mind, we're not anti-Arab.” This was based, I
                    guess, on a calculation that they were a zero threat to Israel. Well, after the
                    energy crisis, I think it dawned on the Israelis before it dawned on anyone
                    else, that maybe the United States might sell out Israel for a barrel of oil,
                    and they became threat number one. The demonization of the Saudis did not occur
                    until after the energy crisis. Before that, it wasn't that they were demonized;
                    nobody ever heard of them. This would be like 'do you know who is the ruler of
                    Fiji?' But after that, after the energy crisis, everybody knows where Saudi
                    Arabia is. Just in a parallel way in the scholarly literature, which I also
                    followed, there was virtually nothing on Saudi Arabia because they would not
                    allow Westerners to come in and do research, social scientists. So there was
                    none, and there's still a gap. But now if you look in any database about books
                    on Saudi Arabia, you'll find hundreds of books on Saudi Arabia, most of them not
                    any good but a heck of a lot of them. Before, you would find memoirs of early
                    travelers and people like St. John Philby, very, very, very little at all. So it
                    was a time when they were not a threat or perceived to be a threat to our
                    interest or to the Arab-Israeli problem or anything of that nature. Westerners
                    were not allowed in there except for business peoplthey didn't have touristand
                    Muslim going on the hajj. It was important for oil but if viewed at all it was
                    sort of viewed in a neutral way: well, they have oil, and we need oil, and
                    that's nice. After the energy crisis, all that changed. One of the difficulties
                    I felt personally after that period was that in my opinion the dynamics of the
                    relationship had not really changed very much since the 1930s, but it's hard to
                    see that because in the 1930s nobody ever heard of the country. In the 1940s we
                    sort of heard of it because of World War II, and then we built Dhahran Air Base,
                    and then there was the Cold War and they were anti-Communist, and there was sort
                    of that among a few people who worried about things like that, and not terribly
                    negatively. Then after the energy crisis all that changed and there was a lot of
                    demonization and still is. There was a lot of misinformation and there still is,
                    and a lot of it is the Saudi fault for not opening their country and allowing
                    people in earlier. But that said, the dynamics that they've got oil and we need
                    oil, that they are creatures of habit, that they realize that if the market
                    dropped out of oil and we went to nonprofit fuels, what are they going to do
                    with it, and they don't have very many other resources, so they have never
                    wanted the price of oil to soar for fear we would go away from their oil and use
                    solar or nuclear or something else. We've always heard about them jacking up the
                    price when in fact they have always been price moderates. These kinds of things
                    have not changed except for world energy cycles, price cycles, since the
                    '30s.</p>

                    be a love-in between Riyadh and Tehran. The fact is that even though there was a
                    marriage of convenience because both countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia, were very
                    anti-Communist, nevertheless there has never been love lost between any Arab and
                    any Persian, and particularly Sunni Arabs and Shia Muslims is a sort of a
                    confessional thing that you add to the mix there. So the relations between those
                    two countries were never as warm as we expected or even was calculated that they
                    were. They were there and they realized that they had to get along because of
                    the worse threat, which was the Soviet Union, but relations have never been good

                    going on. It was finally settled. Actually, King Fahd, when he was Crown Prince,
                    finally put it to rest. I remember when we put it to rest I wrote a paper on
                    this historical dispute which had really made it very, very difficult for them
                    to get along on anything. I wasn't even allowed to publish it because nobody

                </p>
                <p>LONG: The first American academic institution to really have a first-class
                    capability studying the Middle East was Princeton. That was when Professor Hitti
                    was there, and his focus was on the Fertile Crescent. There were a lot of
                    Presbyterians, missionaries, in Lebanon going way, way back to the 1820s, and
                    there was a Presbyterian school at one time, and so there was that link. Many,
                    many Arab Americans were Lebanese or Syrian before there was a Lebanon, and that
                    was their interest. Then Nasser came along and that became a major policy
                    interest of ours. But in the meantime (a) the Saudis would never let social
                    scientists into their country to study, and (b) the Brits ran the Gulf. So there
                    were a lot more scholars looking at the Gulf in England than there were in the
                    United States. So Gulf studies, if you will, particularly on the Arabian
                    Peninsula side, never got that much attention in the centers that grew up when
                    the government started funding various regional area studies, the National
                    Defense Education Act or whatever it was. Again, most of the Middle East studies
                    had to do with the Fertile Crescent region, and Maghreb but you had to learn
                    French to go there. The Arabian Peninsula was pretty much incognito. I maintain
                    that if I do have pretensions to be the leading scholar on Saudi Arabia, it's
                    not because of my scholarship, but rather in the land of the blind the one-eyed
                    man is king. And that is not that far off even now, even today. There are a
                    number of young guys who have come up, not so young anymore, who are very good
                    scholars of the Peninsula, but there's no center that you could...</p>

                        facto anti-Israeli, therefore somehow not quite truly American and
                        anti-Semitic and all that. You were one, but do you talk about this breed of
                        cat called the Arabist as you saw it? and let's stick to the time you were
                        in the Sudan and in Saudi Arabia.</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>LONG: This distinction is an American distinction and it's pretty largely an
                    American Jewish distinction. It goes back to the fact that the Middle East
                    specialists in 1948 did not want to partition Palestine, which had a majority of
                    Arabs, and certainly not without giving them the right of self determination.
                    You remember the famous statement by Harry Truman about how he has many Jews in
                    his constituency but he doesn't have any Arabs in his constituency back then in
                    the election and, therefore, he was going to be pro-Israeli. And that's trotted
                    out by pro-Arab people on the other side of the coin. I came across that a lot
                    subsequently in the United States when I did a lot of lecturing for the State
                    Department all over the United States, and I was vilified all over the place by
                    people who held that view. But when I use this, I use it just the way you were
                    talking about a Sinologist or a Latin Americanist, as a person who knows the
                    culture and the language and has personal experience there, period. Now, if you
                    do that, the first people that came into the Foreign ServicI should say the
                    first people in the Foreign Service who made up most of the Arabistwere people
                    who had some kind of background, and this is limited almost entirely to kids who
                    grew up in oil company families or missionary families, and this is not uncommon
                    with the Far East specialists also. So there was that group, and many of them
                    studied at Ivy League universities, so there was sort of a patina of preppiness
                    that was also applied to them, whether or not justly you can have your own
                    opinion. By the time I was in the field in the '60s, Arabists, such as myself,
                    were from every walk of life and the only thing we had in common was a sort of
                    weird failing that we liked to go to places like this, not because we were
                    exotic but because they were intellectually fascinating. I still think it's a
                    far more fascinating area to be associated with than Europe, which to me as a
                    political watcher, maybe not as an economic watcher, but as a political watcher
                    it was just pretty dull. So the people that I have been discussing as Arabists
                    were specialists. They had had many assignments, that was where they spent most
                    of their career, and they knew the area like the back of their hand. Were they
                    anti-Israel, pro-Israel? They were Americans, and among any random group of
                    Americans you're going to find pro and anti on about any subject you will. I
                    don't think that they were anti-Arab, no, but my feeling is that we weren't
                    pro-Arab the way many groups in this country are. In fact, giving all those
                    lectures that I was talking about, and I did a lot during the '70s and the '80s,
                    people would come up to me and identify me as a fellow pro-Arab and “what we've
                    got to do is this and this and this,” and I said, “Wait, wait, wait. We're
                    pro-American here. My job just has to do with furthering American interests, and
                    my colleagues from the Middle East will be furthering their interests.” So the
                    tar rush that is rather commonly heard about, State Department Arabist one word
                    with hyphens in it, is to me something that was done to demonize people that
                    were perceived to be a threat to the creation and existence of Israel,
                    period.</p>

                    It's like you don't have a liberal colonel and a conservative admirathere are

                    colonel, you're a colonel and you go lead into whatever war, Kosovo or wherever,
                    you're told to. I think people believe that (a) regional specialists, not just
                    Arabists, are pro-their countries to the degree of being anti-American, and to
                    me that is just not so. That is not professional, and I just don't believe that
                    they do this. Now, do they disagree with US policy? I pretty much disagreed with
                    US policy in the Middle East as long as I served there, but that had nothing to
                    do with my not trying to write the most effective policy papers that I possibly
                    could to push whatever policy we were pushing. The other thing is that there is
                    an assumption when a new administration comes in that the people in the old
                    administration are against their changes of policy, but we're not. We are paid
                    to be professional implementers of whatever the head guy wants, and I think that
                    by and large, with exceptions I suppose and with what I consider legitimate
                    differences of opinion, that's what we do. And that's what the Arabists did, and
                    I think they did it better than the people who were politically inclined to
                    follow that administration's policy, because they understood the people better
                    and they knew how to sell the policy better even if they thought it was a bad

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: In the meantime, in 1972, my boss, Phil Stoddard, who was the Office
                    Director, persuaded me to finish my doctorate, which I had never finished. I did
                    this at George Washington on the purely academic reason that it was two blocks
                    from my office. I got interested in the academic side of things as a complement
                    to the operational side of things. So they came up with really a cockamamie of
                    making people FSRUs, if you remember, and I think I was probably the only FSO
                    that switched to being an FSRU, so I could stay in Washington. So I stayed
                    there, and then in 1975 I became a Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations,
                    which I did here in Washington, and wrote a book. Then the next year, let's see,
                    '75-'7no, no, I got.... You can see how good I am at numbers. I remember the
                    appointment came right after the '73 war, and I didn't have time to take it
                    then, so I guess I took it in '74-'75. Then I took a year of leave of absence in
                    '75-'76 and became the first Executive Director of the Arab Studies Center at
                    Georgetown University. So I took two years off basically to be an academic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the time you were in INR dealing with
                        Saudi Arabia. As an analyst in INR, what were you seeing and how were you
                        being used? We're talking about the '73 war and the oil crises and all this.
                        This must have been a fairly hot spot, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, the timing was great, because from '70 to '73 it was pretty dead, and
                    that's when I got my degree. I did it in two years going at night</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, what was your dissertation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: The hajj. I took that 30-page single-space paper, and I needed a topic, and
                    this was all original research. No Western researcher had ever been able to get
                    in and do this, and I had reams of stuff, and I turned that into a dissertation
                    and then had it published by SUNY (State University of New York). Press in New
                    York. It was in print for years and years and years. That's why people keep
                    calling me up, because this is probably the only book in print on the subject.
                    Then comes the 1973 war and, of course, all hell breaks loose about that time. I
                    was actually working on the Arabian Peninsula, not just Saudi Arabia. The
                    British were getting out of the Trucial States and the Emirates at this time, so
                    things in my area were beginning to pick up. So it was a fun time to be there,
                    and there was not all that much expertise going. It's interesting, the NEA
                    Bureau always had a rather jaundiced view of INR...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the reader, INR, Intelligence Research, is a
                        completely separate bureau from the geographic bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LONG: And more than that, it's not an intelligence bureau, but that was the name
                    that it had before there was a CIA and they kept the name, but it was basically
                    the research bureau. It's function was to write analysis, and the policy bureau
                    NEA's function was to write policy. In other words, they were advocates and we
                    were not. So you can see the tension between an analytical paper telling it like
                    it is on the one hand and an advocate of a policy on the other hand. So the
                    term, and it's still the term, is it has to be policy relevant, which, depending
                    on which bureau you were in, means you want to give the policy maker the
                    straight scoop, but on the other hand it means you want to receive analysis that
                    backs up your point of view. So there was that, and that's the kind of milieu I
                    love. What I would do, I realized once a battle is engaged you can't win it,
                    particularly from where I was sitting. So we would dream where we thought the
                    next battle would be. We would write papers, if we could get them through, that
                    nobody thought were terribly threatening. They were on subjects that were not
                    urgent. Our theory was that when they became urgent, and that was one of our
                    calculations, having spread these papers around and having enabled them to
                    become the conventional wisdom of something not terribly important, when they
                    became terribly important, as is the will-of-the-wisp way of policy in the State
                    Department, no matter what they did, they would be playing in our ballpark. I
                    really feel that the years I was there we had as much input on policy making in
                    a way that NEA never really knew about except some of the more discerninand, in
                    fact, some of the discerning would come to us and ask us to write papers because
                    they'd say, “We think this is going to blow up, and we can't get anybody's
                    attention. Can you write a little paper? Since it has not captured anybody's
                    attention, we think you can probably get away with publishing it. Then when it
                    comes out, at least we've set some parameters for how we think the policy ought
                    to work.” And we did that. It was a lot of fun doing this stuff. And a lot of
                    things were happening in the Gulf with the British getting out and then with the
                    energy crisis. I remember that in the '73 war a couple of us really thought that
                    there could be war in May, not in May but by May of '73, we were convinced that
                    war was a very likely prospect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: War between whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>LONG: Arabs and Israelis. And nobody in government was buying this. “Oh, no, no,
                    there was not going to be a war.” Well, a colleague of mine wrote a paper, and
                    it went plunk. Then he left and I took the mantle from him and kept it going.
                    Well, I won't go into the reasons, but there were certain analytical reasons of
                    things that were happening that people were not putting much weight on but we
                    were, that we thought it was a good chance that they could actually go to war.
                    By that spring those factors that we had weighed were themselves decreasing, but
                    not to the degree that we changed our position. I'd like to say that we were
                    more prescient than we were. In-house we had retreated a little bit but not to
                    the extent of pulling back our view. And then the war happened, and we were one
                    of the very, very few people around who had gotten into print saying, “You'd
                    better watch out.” Well, people gave us more credit than we really deserved as a
                    result of that, because we really didn't deserve all that much credit. We were
                    just looking at a situation back before it had become a crisis, but it was
                    indeed the factors that we looked out, we felt, that led to war, not that we
                    knew they were going to. We just said there's a higher chance of war than you
                    guys are giving any credit to. Well, that's kind of right. So I had to put off
                    the Council on Foreign Relations thing all that got through, the war, and then I
                    went and I did at CSIS, the Center for International and Strategic Studies,
                    which was at that time part of Georgetowit isn't noand I wrote another book
                    there on Saudi Arabia. No, no, I think I wrote that book on the Gulf. I wrote an
                    introductory book on the Persian Gulf, because there was nobody who knew
                    anything about the Gulf at that time. I remember the Council was very upset at
                    me because my project was going to be to write a policy book on the Gulf, and as
                    I got into it I realized that it's very difficult to write a policy book for a
                    foreign affairs-aware audience if they know nothing about the Gulf. So I decided
                    to write an introductory book on how the Gulf works and have the last chapter be
                    a policy-oriented chapter, which is not what the Council wanted it to be.</p>

                <p>LONG: There was an international affairs scholarship which they gave to comers.
                    You had to be 35 years old or younger, and I turned 36 before I actually took
                    it, but I was still 35 when I was awarded the thing. And it was for people who
                    they thought were up and coming, and I was awarded an international affairs
                    scholarship. I didn't want to go to New York, so I did it at CSIS and sort of
                    commuted back and forth to New York and wrote the book.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, the people here were good friends, professional to professional, and
                    that's not where I felt the hot breath as much as when I went lecturing. That in
                    itself is a fascinating story, because I kind of got into it by accident. The
                    senior people always like to go lecture in Miami Beach and San Francisco and
                    Hawaii. Then if somebody wanted a speaker in Fargo or Plainview, Texas, or
                    someplace like that, then they would go ask if there's anybody who wanted go,
                    and very often nobody ever wanted to go. Well, I did. Why would I ever be in
                    Fargo, North Dakota, on my own money as a tourist? So I thought it would be
                    interesting to see those parts of America that I would never otherwise see. Then
                    I got a call one day from a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Near East Bureau
                    saying, “Would you like to go to New Orleans?” and I immediately smelled a rat.
                    “Why don't you want to go to New Orleans?” He said, “Well, I'm very busy and I
                    agreed to go but I can't really go. They've got to go tomorrow. Could you go
                    tomorrow? NEA will make all the arrangements for you to go. No problem.” I said,
                    “Sure, I'd love to go to New Orleans.” Well, it was the Zionist Organization of
                    America, which is a very emotional group. He'd learned about who they were, and
                    he basically was chickening out. But I did it for him, and the fellow that took
                    me around was a lovely fellow. He'd been in the Holocaust. He took me to all
                    these restaurants in New Orleans and insisted that he order the food for me, and
                    he would have chicken soup. That was all he would eat, and it was horrible to
                    have all this stuff on your side of the table, but that's what he wanted to do,
                    and I kept saying, “You know, we don't have to...” “No, I want you to do this.”
                    So when I got back to State, evidently they liked me down there and they said I
                    did a good job. The person in Public Affairs Bureau sort of figured I would make
                    a good pinch hitter because most audiences in the United States they want to get
                    the most high ranking person they can find, and the higher the rank the more
                    undependable you are.</p>

                <p>LONG: And very often a lousy speaker. These people would fink out all the time,
                    so I became sort of a designated hitter when the high and mighty would fink out.
                    I have a speaking ability that I can't claim is anything I ever learned, I just
                    have it. But at any rate, it was a kind of serendipitous thing. I got to speak
                    all over the United States when people would fink out.</p>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LONG: The Middle East and then later on terrorism when I was doing an
                    anti-terrorism tour. But I've been in every state in the Union. It's funny, you
                    join the Foreign Service and see America. And it was during these tours, not in
                    the cities and not among the professionals, but the people in the back woods
                    would blow me away. One of the tactics that I came across very often was some
                    Jewish community or synagogue where I'd be going would try to sandwich me
                    between some Israeli expert that they brought over and their local experand very
                    often there's a local expert. What would happen would be the local expert would
                    give all this emotional stuff and then the Israeli would look at him and say,
                    “That's a bunch of baloney,” because the Israeli lives there. This is not
                    nostalgia, this is not romanticism, this is real life. And they expected him to
                    blow me away, but he wouldn't. It wasn't that he was agreeing with me, but I
                    wasn't taking a side either way. And he was saying, “You've got to understand
                    the situation on the ground before you can deal with it. You have to know your
                    enemy before you can deal with them. And by inventing all this stuff, it isn't
                    helping.” This happened to me quite often, so that's where I experienced that.
                    I'd never thought about a State Department Arabist as being a derogatory term
                    until that.</p>

                <p>LONG: No, not until I got to INR and then I went because we were in Oman, another
                    guy and I. We were driving Beirut to Jeddah, off road mostly, and we were going
                    to go over to Jerusalem. This was in May of 1967. I said, “No, I want to do this
                    when I can bring my wife.” Well, then the war happened and I never got to do it
                    until I was in INR. I was making a trip to Yemen and I was in the Arabian
                    Peninsula and I came back through Israel. I thought we were going to talk about
                    Yemen, but what they wanted to talk to me about was Saudi Arabia, because they'd
                    read some of the stuff I had written. It was fascinating that I think more
                    people in Israel have read my stuff than people in this country. I had some very
                    good trips to Israel but not while I was in Saudi Arabia.</p>

                        Israel or if they had a grasp of Israel they didn't get to go into Arab
                        countries because Arab countries wouldn't let them in and it was sort of a
                        built in thing that meant that you're a right handed expert or a left handed
                        expert and you really weren't a switch hitter.</hi>

                <p>This is Tape 3 Side 1 with David Long. How did you feel about our policy, when
                    you had to get up and talk about Middle Eastern affairs? There's always been
                    this split between an American government authority dealing with the Middle East
                    realizes that Israel is not the center of the universe and that there are a lot
                    of Arabs, we have real interests there, not just oil but strategic interests in
                    the area and all, and it's very difficult to get this across to groups, and the
                    only groups around the country that are really terribly interested in it are
                    Jewish groups. I would think this would be very difficult to sort of reconcile
                    this.</p>
                <p>LONG: Recall that when I finished my doctorate and the two master's degrees that
                    I had gotten previously I had studied the Middle East academically. When I got
                    to INR I always felt that if you're going to deal with a country, you'd better
                    know something about it. So when I was in Saudi Arabia I brought a bunch of
                    literature and I talked to ARAMCOans about petroleum economics and geology,
                    about what a Teutonic plate was in the Arabian plate and why there's oil there
                    and what a dome is and stuff like that. I felt the same was necessary about
                    studying about Israel. A fellow who has been a lifelong friend of mine, who is
                    Jewish, Bernie Reich, who as a professor at George Washington and was the head
                    of the Political Science Department there for a number of years, we have a
                    textbook called Long &amp; Reich. We used to go out on hustings, not from State
                    Department, but audiences would ask us to get the Jewish opinion from him and
                    the State Department opinion from me. Actually the Arab-Israeli problem is a
                    very finite subject, and you know all the questions and all the answers after a
                    while. I don't know why we did this but one time we were I forget where now,
                    some rather large audience, Jewish audiencit must have been a congregatioand I
                    have the Israeli point of view and he gave the Arab point of view. There was
                    this guy in the audience who was waving his hand to be recognizethere was always
                    a guy in every audience, you know, who is perpetually at 211 degrees Fahrenheit
                    and all you need is just to blow on them and they blow uand he says, “I want to
                    ask Dr. Long blah blah blah,” so I stood up. “No, no, no, not you, Dr. Long,”
                    and I said, “I am Dr. Long.” He said, “But you're not Jewish.” I said, “No. Did
                    I say anything about Israel you disagreed with?” “Well, you shouldn't be talking
                    about Israel.” And everybody was roaring with laughter by this time. So I don't
                    feel that it is necessary to be only a left-handed or a right-handed person.
                    Later on when I was the Near East Division Chief in INR for the Near East,
                    Israel was in my parish and I studied even more. On the trips that I would go on
                    over there, they would always want to talk to me about Saudi Arabia and I'd want
                    to talk to them about Israel. This was not just in the government, this would be
                    at the Cherou Center, this would be at Tel Aviv University, all over the place.
                    So by no means do I claim that I am an authority on Israel, but I feel that I
                    have a nodding acquaintance, at least a minimal nodding acquaintance. For anyone
                    who pretends to be a specialist in the region, you have to, and I did. I didn't
                    feel that not having served there per se was a handicap.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that often happens to Foreign Service
                        Officers who served in countries and developed and expertise and all, and
                        they sort of get out on the hustings and lectures, they find that there is
                        not a good mix with the academics who get up and talk about this. It's
                        obviously a prejudiced point of view. You're talking about the real world,
                        and they're talking about another one. Did you find this was a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I breached it by having published, having taught. I taught at area
                    universities here at night. I was the head of an Arab studies center at
                    Georgetown. Later on I was at the University of Pennsylvania and taught a year
                    there. I was at the Coast Guard Academy and taught two years there. I went back
                    to Georgetown as a Pearson fellow and taught two years there. I am a member of
                    the Middle East Studies Association, which is the academic Middle East watchers
                    association. And I think I have enough patina, shall I say, of academia that I
                    can hold my own with them in their own bailiwick, which is good and bad. It's
                    good because I have more of a feeling for where they're coming from and less
                    disdain for them; bad in that it can be threatening to them too, particularly
                    when they have a point of view that they want to express. And I generally don't
                    express a point of view if I can get away with it. I do feel that we, probably
                    because of the size of our population, have always felt that we have had the
                    luxury of having separate business, academic, and government regional experts
                    and that they never talk to each other. I think that is wrong, and I always
                    compare this to Israel, which is a small country which does not have the luxury
                    of doing that. So their business people and their economic people and their
                    government people and their academic people are interchangeable, and they can go
                    in and out of either, and we can't. I have met a lot of academic prejudice
                    against me, as they want to say, “Well, you know, you're a government person, so
                    you don't really understand academia.” Yes, that is a huge prejudice, but it's
                    also a prejudice with businesspeople. “You're a government person, you don't
                    really understand this mess.” It's a three-legged stool, not just two, and I
                    think that the United States is losing a tremendous amount of expertise and
                    understanding of regions because we don't talk to each other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had historians and political scientists who don't
                        talk to each other. They speak different languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes. One of the great things when I was at the Coast Guard Academy, the
                    head of the Humanities Department stepped down and they asked me to take it over
                    until the search committee could get another guy. I knew I wasn't going to stay,
                    so I could burn all the bridges and use up all the chips and not have to care.
                    One of the things that I did was I demanded that the sections, for history and
                    government and sociology and blah blah blah, I said, “We are going to write
                    across the curriculum. I don't care what style you use, whether it's Turabian or
                    Chicago, whatever you want, but whatever it is, everybody will use the same
                    standard.” Oh, they were furious. If I'd been the full-time guy I couldn't have
                    gotten away with it, because I would have had to answer to them forever; but
                    because I was leaving at the end of the term, I got away with it. And this is a
                    problem in academia.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that as you were dealing with this and the
                        Council of Foreign Relations and other things that there was a beginning of
                        Arab awakening to the fact that they'd better start grabbing some academic
                        high ground? The Israelis have done this. Actually their friends were
                        members of the educated elite in the United States anyway. But the Arabs
                        were beginning to send their people to college and all. Was there Arab money
                        coming in to support Arab studies? Were you seeing a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, but you have to go back to the fact that the people who had the big
                    money were the people who had the newest Western educational tradition. In
                    countries such as Egypt or Syria they have an old Western education tradition.
                    They've known this for years and years and years and never did anything about
                    it, but then they didn't have any money either. So, yes, there was that. But at
                    the same time, education was prized in the Middle East. It's more honorific to
                    be a doctor than it is to be an ambassador. I was over in Saudi Arabia just a
                    few months ago and I was going by 'David', and inevitably somebody would call me
                    “Dr. David.” As soon as the people heard the 'Doctor', they would no longer call
                    me 'David'. Even if I was trying to be informal with them, I became 'Dr. David'.
                    This is because in their culture education is prized and always has been,
                    without getting into what that means and all thaI don't want to do thajust to
                    say this: As a general proposition, they are very proud of their educated people
                    and how many PhD's they have in their cabinet, whereas here if you have a PhD
                    you try to hide it unless you're either at the Pentagon or in academia. Even at
                    Princeton everybody's called 'Mister'. It's sort of a reverse snobbery. Not
                    there. It isn't so much as we've got to catch up, really there is a basic
                    respect for formal education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing a penetration oI hate to put it this wathe
                        Arab point of view, Arab history, into our academic institutions? And were
                        the oil countries contributing by developing...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>LONG: Well, oil companies contributed to the Middle East Center, yes, and banks
                    and other folks and Arab states, but academia is not where you look for change
                    in attitude. Some of the biggest and, in my opinion, most bigoted pro-Arab
                    voices in this country are in academia. Public attitudes are public, and this
                    means media. I have always felt, and I felt this way when we started the Arab
                    Studies Center, it was not to be a pro-Arab studies center but just to educate
                    people about what they were like with all the wars, but at least you're getting
                    not misinformation but information, and then you can make up your own mind about
                    what you think about them. Maybe that's naive, but I have always felt that we
                    would be better off if we knew more about them even if at the end of the day we
                    were still biased against them, but at least your biases are founded on some
                    degree of information and not just prejudices and misinformation. I have always
                    lauded the fact that we have expanded academic centers studying the region, but
                    then the same is true of any other region. But I don't think that that's the
                    place to try, or would even succeed if you did try, to change basic attitudes. I
                    certainly through the years have known enough people from the Middle East coming
                    over here to know... I could go on and on and on about just the petty slights
                    that they are subjected to at Tysons Corner or anywhere just because of public
                    opinion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, David, I think this is a good place to stop. If you
                        want to make some mental notes to yourself if there is anything more we

                        pick this up. When did you sort of come back on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: After the two years that I was gone at Georgetown, I came back to be the
                    chief of the Near East Division in INR, and then I went from there to the Policy
                    Planning Staff in, I think, 1982.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Let's pick it up after I came back from Georgetown. At the end of the '70s
                    when I was a division chief, State in its wisdom did not replace the Iranian
                    analyst. So I went to the Division Chief for Iran and said, “I'll be your ex
                    officio Iranian analyst, since I've handled the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf,
                    until you can get one.” And the two of us were very, very deeply involved in
                    analyzing Iran before the revolution.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, we'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 7th of August 2000. David, you had something more to say on the
                    academic center before we move on to INR.</p>
                <p>LONG: Right, I just had a lead-in to what I did after I got back. I wanted to
                    mention that in Islam in general and the Arab world certainly and particularly
                    in the Arabian Peninsula, education is a very prized thing, even when Arabia was
                    Arabia-Deserta ideas which freely flowed throughout that stretch of desert.
                    There is to this day more prestige attached to being a PhD than there is
                    attached to being an MD. The time that I was with the Council of Foreign
                    Relations and I was Dr. Long and I had written a couple books, and I was
                    teaching at night from time to time at Georgetown and George Washington and
                    American, I met a lot of Arab students who were getting their doctorates. I was
                    on a number of doctoral dissertation defense committees. Then when I went over
                    there on an extended trip as the Council fellow, I met a lot of these people and
                    doors opened that had never opened for me as a diplomat. And I also, it seemed
                    to them, succeeded in getting a number of people from the Arabian Peninsula into
                    graduate schools at various times, to where they had this naive and very
                    mistaken idea that, if they just called up David Long, he could put their kid or
                    cousin or whoever it was into graduate school. As a matter of fact, the latest
                    phone call was last week when a person from the Gulf called me and asked if I
                    could help get his son into a graduate school. So the time after that, after the
                    trip when I was with the Council on Foreign Relations, gave me a new dimension
                    in my job in the State Department. I was known far more by people who would
                    never had known me at my modest rank had I not done that, and I would be called
                    on the telephone. I remember one time the Foreign Minister of Sudan called up
                    and asked if Barbara and I would come have lunch with him, and the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for African Affairs was there. He was wondering how in the
                    world does this guy know that guy. So I wanted to lead in with that, because as
                    we will go on in conversation, you will see this relationship with these people,
                    which was serendipitous and it was accidental mostly, added something to what I
                    think I did contribute to foreign affairs during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you then went to INR and the Near East dealing with not
                        only the Gulf but also Iran from 1978 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Well, I was there until I went to the Policy Planning Staff. Well, I went
                    to University of Pennsylvania for a year and taught. I think that was in '82. So
                    up until that period I was in INR first as an analyst for the Gulf, all the Gulf
                    States including Iran, and I took Iran on. It was not really part of my job
                    description, but as I said in the last session, I took that on because we needed
                    somebody and I plotted with the division chief for South Asia. Then I became the
                    division chief for the entire Middle East and North Africa subsequent to that,
                    so I got a promotion in the middle of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about INR from your perspective. INR
                        plays different roles at different times. How was INR being used in this '80
                        to '84 period from your perspective in the Near East.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LONG: My perspective is that INR has historically been under used. It was a
                    mixture of full-time civil service people and Foreign Service people. I was a
                    Foreign Service Officer who decided to stay full time because I wanted to teach
                    and write and do things on the side. Because of my background both in the
                    Foreign Service and knowing what the Foreign Service needed or Foreign Service
                    people needed in the Policy Bureau, and also have gotten a degree, having
                    taught, having written, having a different perspective on political analysis
                    than the usual Foreign Service Officer, I felt that there was a way that we
                    could increase our contribution. There were a couple of like-minded people, a
                    couple of whom I helped recruit from the outside as civil servants to come into
                    INR. Basically what we tried to do, rather than to compete with the policy
                    bureaus, Near East Bureau in particular, about crises, when they, or of course
                    everybody, wanted to be on the leading edge of whatever was in crisis. I felt
                    that by the time the crisis started there was no way you could influence it,
                    because people already had their mental images of the nature of the problem and
                    what solutions were best. This was then melded in with what the political
                    leadership wanted to do about that problem, good, bad or indifferent in our
                    professional opinion, and then that was the party line and everybody had to hold
                    to the party line. To try to say, “Hey, guys, I think you're barking up the
                    wrong tree,” was futile. So what we did, what I did as an analyst and then later
                    on as a division chief, was to try to look ahead and see what kinds of potential
                    problems were on the horizon that nobody was paying attention to, because
                    everybody, as you know, was putting out a fire and were so busy working 24 hours
                    a day putting out today's fire that nobody was looking at tomorrow. I don't mean
                    this in an ad hominem way at all. It's just the nature of the work. We would
                    look at situations and grind out papers, very short papers, that would give a
                    constructural frameworI was very big on constructuralizatiothat people would
                    more or less buy into because there wasn't anything riding on it anyway. It was
                    no threat to them, their careers, their promotion or anything to say such and
                    such looked like it was in bad trouble, whereas if it were in bad trouble, you
                    would already have your concept of what it was and what should be done about it.
                    So by the time, if the time arose, and it didn't all the much, but we were
                    fairly good at, among the thousands of wasted things we did, finding the ones
                    that would be the next crisis, like Iran. There wasn't much of a crisis going on
                    when I joined up with George Griffith, who was the division chief, but there
                    soon thereafter was. I think we were able to make a tremendous mark, because
                    when a crisis did arise, they were playing in our ballpark even though they were
                    playing the way we would play it. We did this on numerous issues, particularly
                    the issue of the Shah. That one particularlnow this is all lateI'm convinced
                    that we turned around the State Department which was keeping to the party line
                    that, bad as things were for the Shah, he had staying power and he would stay.
                    Now, we never said he wouldn't, because if we knew that, we would be in the
                    stock market, not in the State Department. We were saying probably the situation
                    is retrievable, but we had serious doubts that the Shah was capable of
                    retrieving them, not because of his cancer, because none of us at my level knew
                    that, but for a bunch of reasons. I remember in October before the revolution we
                    had a conference and we stacked the deck. It was at all objective. We got
                    scholars who we knew thought the Shah had bit the dust already. George wrote a
                    paper, George Griffith, the division chief, full of gloom and doom, and we made
                    it look like it was an academic paper but the academic didn't want to sign his
                    name to it because, you know, academics don't like their name on anything inside
                    government, so everybody bought that. We never actually said that; we just
                    implied it. I remember that the assistant secretary for Near East, Hal Saunders,
                    a great guy, driven guy, he came down and he was going to put in his perfunctory
                    10-minute opening-up-the-conference stint and then he was going to go back and
                    do some real work. But he stayed; he stayed for the whole thing. We knocked
                    their socks off. At the end of that conference, we were the only part of the
                    Department of State that said this guy's in serious trouble and we'd better
                    start looking at what may follow him. And sure, the security types, CIA, those
                    people were already dointhat's their jobut at the policy level we weren't. So
                    that's perhaps a more dramatic example. There were a lot of less dramatic
                    examples.</p>

                        stay in, and we weren't supposed to talk to the opposition. I've talked to
                        Henry Precht, who said he was practically frozen out because he was saying,
                        “You know, this guy might not last.” It wasn't they didn't want to hear it;

                <p>LONG: This comes back to the nature of analysis and the nature of intelligence as
                    a source of information for your analysis. What I was teaching my guys to do and
                    what I was doing was saying, “Don't take anything at face value, even if your
                    mother tells you.” Always say, 'Why did the person say that? What was the
                    person's motive? What are the empirical facts here, and what's opinion, and how
                    plausible is it?' you know, that kind of approach.” So sure, the information was
                    tainted, but the tainting was in how it was interpreted, even by the people who
                    reported it, the agents if it were intelligence. We didn't disbelieve it, we
                    didn't believe it, we analyzed it. We wrote analytical papers that the policy
                    people could not find where we were pro or anti any policwe were just saying,
                    “Bang, bang, bang, here are the facts, here are the views, here is the
                    plausibility....” An example is that in Iran every 40 days after somebody dies
                    there's a memorial evenI'm oversimplifying this thing...</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>LONG: Right. So after the third 40-day uprising, it became pretty clear to us
                    that these were not isolated events. A big, tough thing for analysis, when
                    you're not trying to do the long run 20 years from now that nobody cares about,
                    is when do your isolated events constitute a trend. This is not easy to do
                    except being a Monday morning quarterback, but we said, “This may not be but it
                    looks like a trend. If it is, it ain't good, it's bad, it's getting worse, and
                    we might be on the final slippery slope here.” We didn't say the Shah was going
                    to go, we didn't say, “Your policy's bad.” We just commented on a series of
                    empirically observable facts that suggested that they might not be isolated,
                    that they may actually be a trend and the next 40-day one is going to be even
                    bigger than the last one. That's how we did that. Sure, they didn't like what we
                    were saying, but we were the only group that could get into print. Henry Precht
                    more or less agreed with us, although from where he was sitting on the policy
                    side he was fighting us, because he was paid to. So there were plenty of people
                    that thought that, but no one could get into print. One of the great things
                    about INR in that period was we could get into print. Our boss said, “If you can
                    verify your analysis and make it reasonable and make it convincing and don't
                    take a policy stand on it, we'll print it,” and he did. So that was just one
                    case of many where we raised a little cane and where I think we made a minor
                    impact perhaps, but a difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, say, on the Gulf States? How about Iraq? How
                        were we doing in Iraq at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Our view of Iraq, if you remembeduring that periowent through a series of
                    changes, and it was basically pretty low on the scope, because, yes, it was a
                    confrontation scene against Israel and that made them bad guys. They were
                    steadfastly against us as a competition state. We had no diplomatic relations
                    with them at the time. Therefore, they didn't come up very much, and when they
                    did, they were bad. They were demonized as they became currently, but they were
                    bad guys and not that much attention was placed on them because they weren't
                    perceived as that direct a threat except the ongoing position that they held. So
                    we didn't look at Iraq per se but rather as a security threat to other people,
                    Israel I've mentioned, but also the Gulf States. And the Gulf States, which had
                    become independent in 1971, were scared to death of Iraq. So our main concern
                    with Iraq, even back in the '70s, was as a threat to the oil fields, which was a
                    major strategic vital interest of the United States. That remained so into the
                    '80s when there was a fall, in part because of the Iran-Iraq War. Then they were
                    bad guys again, and at the end of the Iran-Iraq War we tried to convince them
                    that they should act civilized. We told them there was more in it for them if
                    they were civilized than if they were uncivilized, a policy we'd try over and
                    over, but high risk, and it didn't, as you know, didn't work. But that came in
                    the '80s; that was not during this period.</p>

                <p>LONG: We're talking '76 to '82. But, yes, pretty much except for the Dhofar War.
                    Dhofar is a province of Oman, and there was an insurgency that we got into, a
                    Communist insurgency, well, it was, but it was a lot of things. It was ethnic,
                    it was ideological, it was all sorts of things. It was pretty complicated, and
                    the British were mostly fighting it. But because it was Communist, this made it
                    really, really, really bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of the connections in North Yemen, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: South Yemen, yes, right, and a lot of the people who were insurgents had
                    been in South Yemen, which when it was run by the British was at a high level of
                    education. A lot of these people were workers over there or they were workers up
                    the Gulf. Then as the Gulfies, their economy, struck it rich with money, they
                    started laying off the Dhofari and hiring locals or cheaper other people. And a
                    lot of them became unemployed. A lot of them had been in the police force. So
                    it's a complicated thing. Suffice it to say that, if seen in Washington, it was
                    a Communist thing, which it was but it was a lot more. The Shah sent a group of,
                    I think, 150 Iranians over for the war effort, which probably stirred up more
                    concern among the Gulfies than the insurgents themselves. These guys came with
                    every piece of equipment that you could possibly put on somebody's back.
                    Washington couldn't figure out, never admitted, that these people were not
                    welcome because, after all, the Shah was anti-Communist and they were
                    anti-Communist, and this is a Communist insurgency. They should be welcomed with
                    open arms. Well, the Iranians were not Arab. The Arab-Iranian gulf (i.e.,
                    divide) and I'm not speaking of a piece of watewas far broader than was ever
                    given credit for back then. This is a good example of how, if you just look at
                    something in a superficial way and put a label on it, out there 99 times out of
                    100 you're not going to catch what's really going on very well.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LONG: Yes, it endeI'm trying to think now when it did end. You can see my sense
                    of historical dates is terrible. It ended in the '70s and it ended when the
                    British drew ouit may have even ended before that, so I might even be talking
                    about an earlier period, but I was still covering it. I'll have to look at a
                    history book, my owI have a book on it. But at any rate, the dynamics lasted
                    throughout the period. The dynamics of this started when the British left the
                    Gulf and they announced in 1968 they were going to leave and then in 1971 they
                    did leave. That forced the UAE, which had been the Trucial States, Qatar and
                    Oman, to fend for themselves. There was a major policy call, a two-pillar policy
                    in Washington. The two pillars were Iran and Saudi Arabia. That was one of my
                    failures. I couldn't get it through to anybody, because either they knew and
                    wouldn't say or they didn't know and didn't care, but these two guys really
                    didn't get along with each other. So that's the dynamics. We had a pro-Western
                    Shah and we had a pro-Western Saudi Arabia who were not pro-each other terribly
                    much at all. In fact, there were some incidents during the '70s. There was an
                    oil rig incident where the Iranian navy took a Saudi four-rig because it was in
                    a disputed area, even though it was on part of the disputed area that even the
                    Iranians could see would eventually be Saudi, and they took this boat, or this
                    rig, into Kharg Island. This was in the earlier period, but it shows there just
                    wasn't any love lost between these guys. That lasted all the way through the
                    Shah's regime, and we would not recognize this. So the major change then, of
                    course, was the Iranian revolution, which changed the whole dynamic. All of a
                    sudden the Iranians were the bad guys to us and we demonized them. The Cold War
                    then ultimately got over, and that brings us up to date. But these dynamics, I
                    think, are as important or more important than looking at the topical details
                    year by year, and they really didn't change very much during that whole
                    period.</p>

                    needed us, be it fear of Iran, Iraq, the Soviets or whomever, but they didn't
                    want us to be there until we were needed. So they rose to the concept of
                    over-the-horizon. They didn't want us visible, they wanted us over the horizon,
                    and the military kept saying, “We can't be over the horizon and get there in
                    time.” This is part of the reasoning that P. X. Kelley used to...</p>

                    Which now, back during the Kuwait War we had the luxury of having six months to
                    set it up, so I'm not talking about how well it worked. But the idea of it was
                    not even thought about until then. It was because these people didn't and still
                    don't want us visible, they want us over the horizon. This has always been true
                    in that part...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, these are actually very small populations, and
                        bringing a bunch of American military in can be very destabilizing.</hi>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LONG: Oh, yes. There are a thousand war stories or, I guess, sea stories about
                    this, about how some aircraft carrier skipper wants shore leave for his ship in
                    Dubai. Well, God, if they all got off that aircraft carrier, all 5000 strong of
                    them, in Dubai, they'd sink the place. You're right, these are small little
                    places, and they can't handle that big a..., plus their national pride and not
                    wanting visibility, and this was even an issue during the Gulf War. So, yes, the
                    two-pillar policy, which never really worked very well, of the '70s then was
                    replaced, of course, when the Shah was overcome. But up to that timit was
                    something that had been done way earlier and had kept on, I guess, by its own
                    momentum. A word here: During this period Jimmy Carter came in as President and
                    this is when Governor John West of South Carolina became ambassador to Saudi
                    Arabia. He had been Governor of South Carolina when Carter was Governor of
                    Georgia. I think Carter wanted him to be Secretary of Commerce, and he really
                    wanted to be Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He had induced Kuwaitis to come and
                    develop Kiawah Island in South Carolina. He liked Arabs and he wanted to do
                    this, and he wanted to expand American trade in the area. So when he came to
                    town, I was delegated to lead the group of people that were going to give him
                    his ambassadorial briefing, and it was a god-awful briefing. It was terrible. It
                    was the kind you give to political appointees that you really wish would
                    disappear and go away. He was seen also, I think, by some as one of the Southern
                    pride cornpone governors, mainly by people who didn't know what kind of smarts
                    it took to be a Southern pride cornpone governor. And I thought the briefing was
                    terrible. I dutifully gave it because that was my job. But I talked to a mutual
                    friend and said, “You know, we owe it to this guy to give him a better briefing
                    than he got.” So, totally sub rosa, although I did tell the Assistant Secretary
                    for the Near East about it and he said, “Sure, go ahead,” I met West for lunch
                    downtown and told him how the country really worked. It was kind of funny
                    because my college roommate was from South Carolina and so I drew on this. Talk
                    about chutzpah. I sort of used by analogy the way politics in South Carolina
                    workeit was really kind of nervy on my parand I said, “It's all done by
                    interaction. The name on the door doesn't indicate anything. It's all eyeball to
                    eyeball, and so you really have to know who the players are and why they're
                    players and not just assume that because they're a minister or a deputy minister
                    that they're a player, or because they're a member of the royal family either.”
                    I gave as an example a fellow named Edgar Brown, who way back when I was in
                    college in the '50s ran South Carolina for about 50 years, never had an elected
                    office in his life. And West laughed and laughed and said, “Let me tell you a
                    story about Edgar Brown. When I was a state senator, I was instructed by the
                    then governor to go down to Barnwell, South Carolina, and ask Mr. Brown if he
                    would give up his license plate, which was SC1, because the Governor thought
                    that the Governor should have it, not just himself but any Governor. So he went
                    to Barnwell and he saw Mr. Brown, and Mr. Brown said, “Son, I've seen a lot of
                    governors come and go and this one's pretty good but tell him the answer's still
                    no “ and I said “John you're gonna do okay in Saudi Arabia” because it's a very
                    esoteric communications system, it's very much like the American South, you very
                    much have to hear the grass grow.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Then when the Shah looked like he was leaving, the autumn before the Shah fell,
                    when we gave a little conference I mentioned earlier, Hal Saunders, who was
                    Assistant Secretary for the Near East, called me up and asked me if I would go
                    over to Saudi Arabia and write an in-depth report on stability, and I said,
                    “Why? Everybody in State knows the state of stability in Saudi Arabia.” He said,
                    “I know, but we need something, in case it gets really bad, that can show that
                    we are on top of things.” I was on temporary duty over on the intelligence
                    community staff, having been recruited by Ambassador Steigman. There were these
                    two State Department people over at Langley, and I talked to him about it and he
                    said, “Yes, sure, go.” So I was on a temporary duty TDY from another TDY from
                    where I really should have been. I was there for about four or five months. We
                    wrote this in-depth report about Saudi's stability, and all these doors that had
                    opened back earlier when I was Council of Foreign Relations fellow or when I was
                    teaching these guys or helping with the dissertation committee or whatever came
                    to put me in very good stead. And I went all over the country.. I used what is
                    called the ambassador's plane but it was really a C12, and I went all over the
                    place. Prince Turki al-Faisal, now the head of Saudi Intelligence, would make me
                    appointments with regional governors all over the place. It was a researcher's
                    dream, it really was. Would that some poor graduate student could have the
                    access to all these people that I did. And I wrote this 120-page report. Powell
                    said, “Write it in-depth. We really want to send it on up to the Hill.” I
                    figured nobody would read this thing, so I slugged it secret on the theory that
                    if they saw secret documents, they might be induced read it. And the message was
                    this was a very, very stable country. Just because it's religious and Iran was
                    religious and because the Ayatollahs look like they're getting off the
                    reservation over there doesn't mean that there was a similar situation in all
                    monarchies. There certainly was not one here. Well, up on the Hill, the
                    supporters of Israel were trying to tell how horrible this Saudi government was.
                    I think they were afraid that we might sell out Israel for a barrel of oithis
                    happened during the oil shortage. They pounced on this thing and it disappeared,
                    because it was secret and nobody could read it. A little later on there was a
                    book by a fellow named Emerson called The American House of Saud. He devoted a
                    whole chapter to this. What happened was the Shah did fall and the Saudis wanted
                    AWACS. The supporters of Israel did not want them to have AWACS. The US military
                    did want them to have AWACS because if they didn't get it from us, they would
                    get Neptunes from Britain and we couldn't talk good to Neptune like we could
                    talk to AWACS. So we wanted an AWACS in place in Saudi Arabia. In case the
                    balloon went up and it needed to be used by us, we could use it. The Saudi
                    military knew that too. If you recall, the supporters of Israel had collected
                    enough votes in the House and the Senate to shoot down this idea of the sale.
                    You know, with foreign military sales, you have to get approval. Things were
                    looking bad, so I called up a friend of mine who was at CSIS, the Center of
                    Strategic Studies, where I'd been earlier. He had just finished this long
                    economic study on Saudi Arabia, so I said, “Why don't we pare these down, put
                    them together, and publish it.” So we did, and it came out about four weeks
                    before the vote. It was absolutely a smash, not by pleading but just by
                    analysis, rebutting the idea that this place was seething with unrest and was
                    unstable. That was what Emerson pounced on. His thesis was that my secret
                    version, which if you're a reader you can't read because you're not cleared,
                    showed how decrepit and terrible and horrible these people are. Then in the
                    second version that Long did with the other fellow, it said that they're very
                    stable. But he did such a stupid job that what I'd done in the first I didn't
                    have to be diplomatic, I just said, “So-and-so has a drinking problem,”
                    whatever, and in the next version I would said, “So-and-so has health problems.”
                    So I cleaned it up, but the conclusionand he showed about five different
                    conclusions where the language had changebut he shouldn't have put in the
                    conclusions, because in every case the conclusions were word-for-word the same
                    in both versions. They were reviewing this in the Wall Street Journal and they
                    called me up. I said, “Look, I'm not going to defend this, but I suggest, before
                    you jump to conclusions, you look at my conclusions and see how I doctored them,
                    because Emerson gave you the conclusions in the book.” They did, and the guy,
                    after he saw that, gave it a bad review, and that made them mad. So they went to
                    the Washington Post and Hehos was one to review it and he looked at it and he
                    refused to. That was the end of that, but it illustrates sometimes the pressures
                    of Israel, or supporters of Israel, in the Gulf in areas which have absolutely
                    zero to do with the Arab-Israeli problem or Israeli security.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, but in this case it was because of Saudi Arabia and it was because of
                    its premier position in oil, and it was a fear that if we had an oil shortage
                    and we had to choose which way we would go, all of which was hypothetical. That
                    book is not in print anymore but people still quote from it. To my mind, that is
                    one of the best pieces of original academic research that I ever did, because I
                    would just fly into wherever and go into the royal majlis or the governor's
                    majlis or whatever and we would have a nice long talk, and it was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left INR where and went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: I left INR in I believe it was 1982 and took a year off and was a visiting
                    professor at the University of Pennsylvania and taught a course on the Middle
                    East. It was lots of fun. I had about 120 people sign up for the class, and this
                    is an Ivy League, private university, and you should not have 120 people in any
                    class. So I told them they were all going to have to memorize the Arabic
                    alphabet and the Hebrew alphabet, and I said, “We'll give you extra credit if
                    you can learn the Greek alphabet.” I was just making up stuff to try to scare
                    these people out. I got it down to 80, and I had one teaching assistant. This
                    fellow walked in the door and said, “I'll be a teaching assistant.” He had just
                    finished his comprehensive examination of PhD. I divided the course into thirds,
                    and I lectured two days a week and one day a week we each had our own little
                    group, which made it small enough where there could be interaction among the
                    students. I took the graduate students and some of the upperclassmen, and they
                    took the others. One of them was an Australian diplomat, he was the real TA. The
                    other fellow, a fascinating guy, was a lawyer in Philadelphia and got bored. He
                    was going on his PhD, had passed his comprehensive, later went out to Beirut to
                    write a dissertation on using a free-floating exchange rate as a political
                    indicatowhen people lose faith in the currency, you know the country's deaand
                    got chased out by Islamic Jihad. I called up CIA and said, “Can somebody get
                    word to this guy to get the heck out of Dodge.” He did all sorts of other
                    things. Then he went and worked for Chase Bank and he pioneered in commodity
                    hedging, called commodity stops. He made another big bundle there, an oil
                    contracI won't go into thaand then he joined a bunch of guys down in Houston in
                    a little oil company, a gas company, but they sold a refinery to Papua, New
                    Guinea and he made another bunch. Now he's a college president somewhere. He may
                    turn up being Secretary of State for one day for all I know.</p>

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LONG: Galen Banker. He was from Michigan. Galen and I, I don't know, our paths
                    keep crossing in the funniest places, in the Middle East, in New York, all over
                    the place. I threw that in because it's another example of how when you're doing
                    something totally different and you meet a different group of people than you
                    normally would associate with, they keep popping up. This added another
                    dimension to my being able to be effective in the Department. Another fellow was
                    the President of Shell Oil Company USA, which is, you know, a wholly owned
                    subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. He was in Saudi Arabithis was during the petrol
                    dollar perioand Shell USA doesn't have much crude in America. So they were
                    worried about their crude supplies and they wanted to do a joint venture with
                    the Saudis not in order to make money on the joint venture but mainly to
                    guarantee that they could get crude if they needed it. So he was over there with
                    his Vice President for Near East, and I had just flown in for one of my periodic
                    visits to Governor West. Governor West called me up and said, “Come on down to
                    the residence. I want you to meet these guys. One of the guys is head of Shell
                    USA.” So I walked down and here was this guy with a silver mane of hair and
                    immaculately dressed. So I figured the guy, the CEO, looks like a CEO. This
                    other guy, whom I assumed was the economic counselor, whom I'd never met, was
                    well dressed and everything but he didn't look the picture of the other guy, and
                    he kept saying the stupidest things. I'm thinking, my goodness, this CEO is
                    going to think we're a bunch of klutzes. So I would say, “Well, that's a very
                    good point, but if you look at it this way,” and I flat contradicted him about
                    six times in a row. It turned out I was wrong. He was the CEO and the other guy,
                    who looked like a CEO, was the economic counselor. Well, don't tell me why, but
                    this guy kind of liked me. So he called me down to Houston, asked if I could
                    come down to Houston and talk to them from the State Department, which, you
                    know, we can do if we don't take any money for it. Again, it really did, talking
                    not just to him but to his people, it gave me a whole new dimension in
                    understanding world petroleum affairs and global pricing and all of that. I
                    probably never would have had this experience as a political type just working
                    at State or overseas. So I really had a lot of these kinds of things happen in
                    my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time when West was Governor, you mentioned

                <p>LONG: He used me, I thinthis is just my theorhe used me the way a governor would
                    use a person who knew the politics of South Carolina and was trusted and whose
                    opinions were trusted as a sort of counselor/advisor, informal. He'd take me
                    around on meetings too. I was with him and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff when they made the decision to ask us for the AWACS. It was really funny
                    because the Saudis wanted us to ask them if we could send an AWACS to them,
                    because they didn't want to get people off the reservation in their country, and
                    we wanted them to ask us to send it to them for the same reason. So it was going
                    back and forth, and it was all but done but the King had not agreed. The King
                    was Fahd. The day-to-day operations of the country were run by the Crown Prince,
                    who was there with us. The King had gone to bed, he had gone to sleep, so they
                    were saying, “No problem.” I sort of nudged John and said, “The opera ain't over
                    until the fat lady sings. He might not do the day-to-day operations but he is
                    the king in this country and until he says yes, it is not done. The next morning
                    he woke up, the King, and he was in a bad mood, I think dyspepsia in the
                    evening, and he said, “Oh, no, no, I know what happened.” They called him at two
                    o'clock and he was in a bad mood and he said, “Hell, no,” and went to sleep. So
                    we all had to wait until he woke up the next morning and he was in a good mood,
                    and he said, “Sure, we'd be happy to do this.” It was that kind of thing that I
                    used to do with him a lot. He really was good with him. He and Fahd got along
                    very well together. They'd lied to each other like a bunch of Southern
                    politicians. I remember the Ambassador had a junior officer who was sort of his
                    flunky, and he'd take notes and he wouldn't have a clue what was really being
                    said. He would write down what they literally said, but you don't listen to the
                    words, you listen to what the guy is trying to say, whether you're in South
                    Carolina or whether you're in Iraq. And they knew exactly what they were saying
                    to each other, they really did, but if you were a literalist or if you weren't
                    used to that kind of communication, even if you knew Arabic, you really won't
                    understand it. Later on West brought me in to see Fahd because I administered a
                    master's degree to Prince Bandar, the current ambassador, which is another
                    story. At any rate, he introduced me as the greatest scholar since Aristotle,
                    blah blah blah, and you knew it wasn't for me. He was making the point of 'we've
                    done all this just for your nephew', which is 'just for you'. Of course, Fahd
                    wasn't fooled a minute. He knew what West was doing, and so when it was his turn
                    to reply, he said, “I don't have a doctorate. My only education is what I've
                    learned dealing with people,” which is not true, because all that generation
                    were tutored. He said, “But we hire a lot of doctors in our country,” and he
                    quotes the Koran where it says, “[Arabic, inaudible],” which means so many of
                    them are like donkeys carrying encyclopedias on their back. But because it's
                    from the Koran, everybody just cracked up laughing. And the note taker was
                    writing this down. He thinks that he was insulting us. He wasn't insulting us.
                    They knew exactly what they were saying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've often hearnot often but from time to time remarkethat
                        American politicians who become ambassadors often develop a rapport that no
                        Foreign Service Officer could have. The King of Saudi Arabia is a
                        politician, the same way the Pope is a politician. You have to be elected by
                        a conclave of your peers, and this is not invalid. Politics played a part in
                        this. So basically politicians know how to talk to politicians, and
                        diplomats often don't speak the political language because that's not their
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: It isn't. There are those who are naturally good at it, if you just have a
                    natural bent for it. Herman Eilts was terrific there, and a number of other
                    ambassadors that I've known were terrific, but it wasn't something that they got
                    at the Foreign Service Institute. It wasn't necessarily even something they got
                    on the job, because that wasn't their job. Their job was to implement policy,
                    not to make it up. Some political appointees are dreadful, but others, if they
                    have this talent that you're talking about, are tremendously effective.</p>

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>LONG: Yes. Going back to when I was talking about South Carolina politics. There
                    are a lot of similarities there, and he fit in just perfectly with this
                    indirect, never come right out and say something, tell this long rambling story,
                    but, bingo, the other guy knows exactly what he's saying without him ever having
                    to say it. He was very, very effective. The Bandar incident was interesting. He
                    came over to go a year of War CollegI think the Command Staff Schooand he wanted
                    to get a master's degree because he wanted to show all the people in Saudi
                    Arabia, who were all getting doctorates, that he wasn't just a dumb foggle.
                    Well, this shows you how important maybe not the education but the degree is. He
                    was going to get in at Auburn University at Montgomery. And West wanted to make
                    sure that he got a good education and that the US government was helping him. So
                    he called me up and said, “I want you to get this guy a master's degree.” They
                    all thought I could do this. I called up the Dean of Johns Hopkins School of
                    Advanced International Studies, whom I knehe was a wonderful guand I explained
                    the problem to him. I said, “I don't know whether you can do anything about it
                    or not, but this guy is a real comer. He's a nephew, but not just a nephew,”
                    because the King's got God knows how many hundred nephewbut the King really
                    depends on him almost more than his own father, who was the Defense Minister. So
                    he thought about it a while and he said, “Yes, we have a master's degree program
                    for foreign people like that. I said, “His problem is he's got to live in
                    Montgomery. He's got a residence problem.” So I worked out with him whereby he
                    would fly up twice a month and he would have four tutorials of four hours each
                    over two days. That's a lot of intensive stuff. He agreed, and then he stepped
                    down from the deanship. A new fellow came in who was under tremendous pressure,
                    because the board of governors or whatever it was, SAIS, had heard about it up
                    in Baltimore and the Jewish members of the board did not want this to happen at
                    all. I had to go tell him, “I think you really should do this because I have in
                    writing from your predecessor that we're going to do it, and I'm assuming the
                    President is taking a personal interest in this, so I really think you ought to
                    do this,” and he got the point. So we gave him this master's, and I told Bandar,
                    “They're not selling you a degree. You're going to have to work your butt off if
                    you want to do well, and you don't want to lose face by not doing well,” and he
                    did. Very, very bright. I tried to keep it quieI don't mean secret quiet but
                    just not making a splash. I don't know whether you know much about Bandar, but
                    it's impossible for him to keep a low profile. He was on the air and he was just
                    everywhere, in all the gossip columns. I said, “Oh, my gosh.” Finally I would
                    fly my whole crowd down to Montgomery just so we'd have at least a reasonably
                    lower profile. We used to talk politics and stuff. His uncle would call up.
                    Bandar called him 'the CP', Crown Prince. You could hear both ends of the
                    conversation, because he would shout through the phone. What a tremendous year I
                    had. I'd been working in the State Department. I had nothing to do with SAIS but
                    fortunately, because of the foresight of the former dean, I was able to pull
                    this off. So again, that was another thing that I did. Bandar used to play
                    handball with the Secretary of Defense and he wanted me to come down and play
                    handball with them. I said, “Get real, Bandar. There's no way a guy my rank is
                    going to...,” because if I wanted to, I could have done it, but I said, “There's
                    no way you want to have a guy, a little ranking guy, with the Secretary of
                    Defense and the sensation of the diplomatic community here playing handball with
                    them. Tell me anything you want to tell me about it, but I ain't going.” But it
                    was that kind of thing, and he's a perfectly charming guy, smart as a whip.</p>

                        What was the role? In INR, these various jobs but particularly Policy
                        Planning can mean a whole different thing in different times. I guess Shultz
                        would have come on board about that time.</hi>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>LONG: Policy Planning is, even more than INR, what the Secretary wants it to be.
                    INR, quite apart from it being what the policy bureaus want it to be, does have
                    continuity of the civil servants there who stay, and so they know more about a
                    country than some brand new desk officer who's just getting used to his new
                    country. Policy Planning Staff can be a power of influence or it can be nothing.
                    Steven Bosworth was the head of it, a very nice guy. One of the early things I
                    did was to write a critique on our policy with Lebanon, which I thought was
                    really stupid. Again, I didn't criticize the policy; I took all of the public
                    policy statements that Shultz madthey were written by Peter Rodman, who was on
                    the Policy Planning Staff, because that's one of the major things they do, they
                    house the real speech writer for the Secretary. I took them one by one and I
                    smashed them. He would say in some public speech, “We must do this in Lebanon.
                    Here are our aims and goals and blah blah blah.” And then I would show why that
                    was nonsense. I never mentioned the policy. I only looked at the argumentation.
                    I didn't know whether I could get away with it or not, but we were not
                    discussing, we weren't criticizing policy, I was just using logic against the
                    argument. I thought, well, it's worth a while, let's see what happens here.
                    Bosworth evidently fretted for about a week over it, and he let it go and it
                    went through. I don't think it had that much influence on Lebanon policy. I
                    think the Lebanon policy collapsed of its own weight soon thereafter, but at
                    least it provided a new rationale for when we had to change our policy, why it
                    was absolutely vital that we do so. Again, I was in conceptualization. The
                    ironic thing was that Peter Rodman, when Bosworth left, became the new head of
                    the Policy Planning Staff. We got along very well. It was a very prestigious
                    place to be. It was kind of boring, because it was to be long-term policy
                    planning and there is no such thing. You don't have time, nor should you because
                    things can change so that most long-term policy planning is irrelevant. So you
                    either did very little or you would try to find thingI would anywawhere I
                    thought it might possibly make a little difference. I think I had a marginal
                    impact there, which marginal is probably as good as one could expect to have.
                    One day I saw Bob Oakley down in the lunch room. I said, “What the heck do you
                    guys do in antiterrorism?” because he was the ambassador at large for
                    antiterrorism, and he said, “Well, you know, we don't really have a good
                    Arabist. Why don't you come on down here?” So I went up to Peter and I said,
                    “What if I jumped ship and go down and work for Bob?” and he was, I think,
                    pretty overjoyed not to have this thorn anymore. So I went down there, I think,
                    about '84 or '85, and I hadn't been there more than about three days when all
                    hell broke loose. This was when Jeremy Leviyou remember the namhe was a
                    journalist, and he was kidnapped in Lebanon. He had escaped, so our office was
                    supposed to make all the arrangements. Well, the military guy who was on the
                    staff, a colonel, was off on a war game, or maneuver. He was the guy who knew
                    all the people in the Pentagon and everybody. So Bob came and said, “Hey, David,
                    take care of this,” so I called up the Pentagon and I got this colonel and he
                    said, “What's your fund cite?” and I said, “Fund cite? We don't have a fund
                    cite? We don't have any funds at State.” He said, “No, you're basically no
                    ticket no laundry.” So I said to Oakley, “What do I do now?” He said, “Call
                    Ollie North.” I said, “Who's Ollie North?” He said, “He's the guy that does
                    counterterrorism over there at the White House.” I didn't know him. Nobody did.
                    This was before anybody knew him. I called him up and I said, “Hi. I'm Dave
                    Long. I work for Bob Oakley. There's a problem. We don't have any money to pay
                    for this plane.” They wanted to fly this plane over to Germany with his wife on
                    board and then pick him up and bring him back. He said, “No problem. Call this
                    number and ask for....” I didn't get the name. I asked twice and still didn't
                    get the name. But things were breaking very fast, so I had to call the number. I
                    hoped that the NCO or whoever it was on the other side would usually answer
                    “So-and-so's office, Sir.” He said, “[Inaudible] office, Sir,” and I still
                    didn't know and I said, “This is David Long. I'm with the Office of
                    Counterterrorism at the State Department, and this is an urgent call. I need to
                    talk to him right away.” So he came right on the line and was very helpful.
                    Within about two minutes the colonel called back and basically said, “Is there
                    anything more I can do for you?” I figured I don't know who this guy is but he's
                    got to have some rank. Well, he was the deputy to the Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff. He was a three-star general, a lovely guy. Well, that period in
                    the middle '80s, as somebody said about history, it was just one damn thing
                    after another. We only had a staff of, I think, eight or nine people. We were
                    running all over the world, we were doing all sorts of things, we were task
                    forces. I led a couple of emergency support teams, one on the Achille Lauro and
                    one for the TWA hijacking. We were everywhere. It was totally exhausting but it
                    was probably the most exciting time, I guess you could call it, in my whole
                    career, because there was no standard operating procedure. This had never
                    happened before in such a concentrated way. We were flying by the seat of our
                    pants.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: A little bit. Ollie was not a freelancer. He was a good Marine in that
                    respect. The problem was that you don't give an unguided missile a blank check.
                    So when he goes to his superiors and they say to him, “Ollie, don't tell me what
                    you're doing. Just get the job done,” you're asking for it. In my opinion, it
                    wasn't Ollie's fault. I'd love to have a guy like Ollie working for me, but I'd
                    want to know what he did every second of the day, because he would carry out
                    what he thought was what he'd been ordered to do. I remember one time we had a
                    group of relatives of one of the hostages and there were two contacts for them,
                    me and over in the Near East Bureau another fellow. The two of us would trade
                    off and trade off and nothing was happening and nothing was happening, and they
                    got more frustrated and they wanted to see Bob Oakley. I was very much against
                    this, so then, well, maybe they wanted to see the Assistant Secretary for the
                    Near East, and he was very against it. We held out as long as we could, and
                    finally they went to see Bob Oakley. It was a terrible visit, because they
                    didn't want to see him, they just wanted to bellyache. I don't mean that
                    snidely, because they were very frustrated. What I was afraid was going to
                    happen happened. After they saw him, who are they going to see when they want to
                    see the President, because that's where this is going to go. They don't see
                    these hostages getting out any time soon, and sure enough, they saw the
                    Assistant Secretary, they saw the Deputy Secretary, then they saw the Secretary
                    and that wasn't the happiest meeting. Then they saw Vice President Bush and then
                    they saw the President. In the hall the President said to Ollie, “Ollie, we've
                    got to get these boys out.” I though 'uh oh', and sure enough those were orders.
                    I am convinced that what he did in the Iran Contra thing was not done just as
                    skullduggery for the pure heck of it. By gosh, his Commander in Chief said,
                    “We've got to get these people out.” Now I thought that whole thing was the most
                    cockamamie idea I ever heard of. We were not officially told about it, so
                    officially I don't know anything about it. Only a fellow whom I recruited to
                    work for mI was Deputy Director of the Office for Regional Affairs, we had a
                    Deputy Director for Functional Affairs and we had a Senior Deputwe figured it
                    out. I won't go into detail, but we figured it out, what was happening, and we
                    told Oakley. Oakley was not officially informed either, so he couldn't complain
                    because he wasn't officially informed, which I think is why he wasn't officially
                    informed. So he sent a letter to the Secretary but it never went through the
                    normal channels. He just handed it to him in a staff meeting one day. Later on,
                    when it came out and the FBI found a copy of that letter and they asked the
                    Secretary, “What about this?” he said, “I don't remember ever getting that
                    letter.” Well, he never did officially. He knew what was going on too. I can't
                    really go into much detail except that that gives you a flavor for Ollie North
                    guy. He was a live wire.</p>

                <p>He worked like a devil, and he would come up with a cockamamie scheme a day and
                    he usually would run it by us, and usually I would tell him why I thought it was
                    a cockamamie idea, although some of them were brilliant ideas. And if it were,
                    he'd say, “Yes, I guess it was a cockamamie idea,” and that would be the end of
                    it. But on this one, I think here was a way he thought that he could really get
                    these people out.</p>

                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>LONG: Demonized, we demonized people. I've studied this as a political scientist,
                    and I've never really satisfied myself as to why we demonize one guy and don't
                    demonize another guy. You can come up with 'we hate Arabs' or this or that, but
                    that doesn't do it, I don't think. We demonized Saddam and, God, if there's a
                    demon around, he's it. We demonized Idi Amin and we demonized Qadhafi. Once we
                    demonize someone, rightly or wrongly, then that person is a demon and then we
                    act toward them accordingly. I would like to assume that we do it cynically, but
                    I think that many of us don't, that actually it's more comfortable to us in our
                    conscience to believe this crap than just to do it not believing it. Qadhafi was
                    demonized. I once was in a meeting with Stan Turner, Admiral Turner. He was the
                    DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) guy. That was the time when Ambassador
                    Steigman got me on this staff job not at CIA but on the Intelligence Community
                    staff. Somebody heard that I knew something about Saudi Arabia, so I was invited
                    to one of their pre-briefs, which is a wonderful idea. I wish the State
                    Department would do it. The only people who really know in-depth what's going on
                    in the country are the lowly desk officers. When they have these thingthis was
                    before the DCI briefs the Presidenthey bring in people who know something. It
                    has nothing to do with rank. You can be a GS-12 or you can be director of a
                    clandestine service, you can be anybody. They're very structured and somebody
                    writes a paper, everybody reads it, and you go in and it's a 15-minute session
                    and that's it. So you've got to say what's on your mind and say it quick and get
                    out. It's fascinating. And rank does not matter. I don't know how I got invited,
                    but it was on Qadhafi. Somebody had something, “What do you think?” because they
                    knew I was in the State. Being a Southerner, I said, “My ole daddy he taught me,
                    he said that when you see a hornets' nest there are only a couple of things you
                    can do. One is you can burn it until all of the hornets are dead, or you can
                    just walk away and leave it, but the thing you don't want to do is poke at it
                    and leave them alive, because they're liable to sting you.” That was not
                    appreciated by Stan Turner. But that's what we were doing. We were creating a
                    superpower out of this guy, because his biggest enemy was a superpower. To my
                    way of thinking, he was not a threat to the national security of the United
                    States. He was an irritant, a very big irritant, yes, but not a threat to our
                    whole security, and in terrorism the same. He was demonized at the time, so when
                    we were dealing with his terrorism, it was hard to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>If you remember when we bombed Libya, that's an interesting story. In the
                    previous December two airports, Rome and Vienna, if you remember, were attacked
                    by Abu Nidal's group and a lot Americans were killed. I had sort of anticipated
                    that the previous summer, because we had not noticed, not confirmed but we
                    believed, that Abu Nidal had moved from Syria to Libya. I asked CIA if they
                    would write an unclassified paper about the Abu Nidal organization, about which
                    nothing was known. Well, they can't do that, because they deal with so much
                    classified stuff that they just can't. So I wrote one, and it had not been
                    cleared by anybody. I was going to wait till after the holidays and call a
                    meeting and see if I could beg them to clear this so we could get it out to the
                    public. I thought we needed the public to know more about this group in case
                    something happened. Well, something happened before I could get this done. I
                    think it happened on the 30th of December. So Oakley came and said, “Have you
                    got anything on Abu Nidal?” “Well, the only thing I have is this paper, but it's
                    not cleared.” So it showed up in the press the next day. Abu Nidal was connected
                    with Libya. So there were big meetingI wasn't privy to theat the top levels
                    about what could we do about it. There were those who wanted to take action
                    against Libya because he had really gotten off the reservation on this and we
                    were able to trace this directly to Qadhafi. Cooler heads prevailing, we told
                    Qadhafi, “We know what you're doing. You do it one more time and you're going to
                    pay.” So instead of taking any kind of military action, we were told to put more
                    sanctions on them. Well, the problem was we had invoked every law that had
                    sanctions in it already against them except one, and this was the Emergency
                    Powers Act, which says that if a country is a national security threat to the
                    United States, which obviously he was not, you could institute a total embargo
                    on them. And we did, and this meant that if you have a totally British firm that
                    was owned by an American owner and the American owner could not deal with it and
                    they went to the British firm then you had a problem “what do you do”? and I
                    remember the deputy secretary, a very savvy guy said, cause people wanted to go
                    after those firms, so he said, “no, we don't want a lawsuit, we'll go with an
                    open mouth policy”.</p>
                <p>We'll tell everybody which companies are having their foreign subsidiaries do
                    business with them, and that will be such a black eye that they're going to lose
                    market share and they won't do it; and sure enough it worked. Then the Berlin
                    disco happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain what that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>LONG: This was a discotheque in Berlin that was bombed by Libyan saboteurs,
                    terrorists. Actually we were right behind them, and we almost got them before
                    they got hit. He had tried several others times. In fact, we were successful
                    against him, but this time they got through and they did it, and you knew they
                    did it. So, again, what do you do about it? It was clear that we were going to
                    have to use military force because we said we would if he did any more. He had
                    done more and we knew he was doing more, but he had not succeeded in any of the
                    other ones and he did here. So there was a big to-do in the public media about
                    whether or not the President was a cowboy and blah blah blah. The fact was we
                    really didn't see that we had any choice. If you make a threat and you don't
                    carry it out, then it's 'Katie, bar the door'. So we did it, and the fascinating
                    thing about the response wathere were two thingone, I was asked to write letters
                    from the President to all the Arab leaders telling them why we had to do it,
                    because we knew that, even though they couldn't stand him, they would have to
                    stick together as Arab brothers and criticize us. What happened was that they
                    didn't say a word publicly, but privately they said, “Why didn't you knock him
                    off when you had the chance?” But the good that that did was not against Qadhafi
                    so much as it finally got the Europeans to pull up their socks. They were making
                    money in Libya and they didn't want to admit that terrorism is everybody's
                    problem, not just somebody else's problem, and they were always saying, “This is
                    the Americans' problem. We are not involved in this.” Well, this happened in
                    Berlin and it happened in several other places. Their intelligence services knew
                    it, but it didn't come out in public because it was...</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: And in Turkey. So the decision was made on our part at the highest level to
                    let folks know why we knew he did it. Some intelligence folks were very upset
                    about that, but we did, because the Europeans were trying to say, “We don't know
                    what the Americans are talking about. They're just a bunch of cowboys over
                    there.” Well, they knew full well what we were doing and they didn't think we
                    would spill the beans as to why we knew. We did, and it forced them to pull up
                    their socks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are some intercepted calls, telephone calls, I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LONG: Yes, right, which to this day I couldn't even talk about except it came out
                    in Newsweek. It was a calculated decision to make, and the Europeans as a result
                    of that got real serious for really the first time, I think. They were serious
                    sporadicallbut really got serious in intelligence cooperation and sharing and
                    law enforcement against terrorism. So the effect of this was salutary, not
                    necessarily on stopping Qadhafi per se but on increasing our cooperation with
                    the Europeans. When they would have a meeting of the Economic Seven, or however
                    many there were back then, they discussed it, and Oakley would be going along
                    with Shultz to discuss this. So when you look at a single case such as this one,
                    the implications of it go like dropping a block in a pond and seeing how far out
                    the ripples go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LONG: There's a story told about a fellow who has a flat tire in front of an
                    insane asylum. He was changing the tire and all the lug nuts fell in the moat
                    which was between him and this island, and he didn't know what to do. This guy
                    over on the other side of the wall on this island said, “Why don't you take one
                    nut from the other three wheels and then you'll have three nuts on each wheel
                    and you can drive somewhere where you can get them.” He said, “That's a good
                    idea. If you can think that up, why are you on the other side of the wall?” And
                    the guy said, “Well, I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.” And that to me sums up
                    Qadhafi. Every time he would be confronted not just with a bluster or a show of
                    force but what he thought was real...he'd gone too far. He'd back off and
                    disappear into the woodwork until he thought nobody was looking again, and then
                    he'd come back. That's what he did, but I think the sanctions and the loss of
                    business and everything else that has happened to him since is what finally made
                    him agree to send these two guys to be tried.</p>

                    flying it and that will teach them a lesson. The Israelis have been trying to
                    teach the Arabs a lesson since 1947 and they've never succeeded, and the Arabs
                    are trying to teach the Israelis a lesson. They don't succeed in teaching each
                    other lessons very easily. So just to say, “As a matter of principle, you've got
                    to teach them a lesson,” to me is pretty bad policy, but there are timeand the
                    ones we are talking about, I think, are excellent examplethat there are times
                    when teaching a guy a lesson will work, if he hurts bad enough.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel when you encountered terrorism? Were we
                        developing a pretty good intelligence system of getting information about
                        what was going on?</hi>

                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>LONG: I think we have a good intelligence system, we've had it before and we've
                    had it since. The problems are, there are two areas here. One is what you target
                    your resources to collect. During the Cold War the bias was so heavily aimed at
                    the Soviet Union that anybody else had a hard time getting resources to collect
                    for them. But something happened, and it wasn't just these incidents per se, but
                    over a period of time, if you want to put a date on iI don't think that putting
                    dates on it is necessarily important, as you can tell, because I can't remember
                    myselI would say the Munich Olympics was the beginning of...</p>

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>LONG: 1972, somewhere around there. This was the beginning of a process by which
                    we began to look at terrorism not as a subset of some other policy, like Middle
                    East terrorism or the IRA terrorism in Ulster or something, and began to look at
                    terrorism as a generic unit of policy interest of which the IRA or Middle East
                    group were subset of a global issue. It's the same things are happening but
                    we're looking at it differently now. This happened while I was there, I think. I
                    don't think anybody consciously was thinking along these lines. It evolved. But
                    by the time I got there, there were so many terrorist incidents that happened in
                    the middle 1980s that it became, I think really for the first time but not just
                    automatically, it evolved to the point for the first time that terrorism became
                    a global policy rather than a set of nonrelated subjects. As a result of that,
                    we began to look at terrorist incidents all over the world in a different light.
                    The Office of Counterterrorism was started after the Munich Olympics. The
                    precursor to the military's Delta Force went way back then. That didn't
                    constitute an antiterrorism policy, but all of these things over a long period
                    of time evolved into that, and we still have that. And the strength of it when I
                    was there, and a remarkable thing to me, was the degree of cooperation,
                    consultation among the 20-odd US agencies and departments that had a piece of
                    the action. I remember one time I was going to Paris and I wanted to talk to
                    their sleuths and their military and their diplomats about a common problem, and
                    I was told by someone in Paris, “Well, they won't talk to you,” and I said, “Why
                    not? We talk to them every day.” “Oh, no, no, no, they'll talk to you but not
                    with the other guys in the room.” And we never had that problem, and when you
                    think about how much turf fighting goes on and how much oversized ego is
                    involved in federal bureaucratic politics in our country, it is rather amazing.
                    And now they call the head of the Office of Counterterrorism at State, they call
                    it Coordinator for Counterterrorism, and he does, he coordinates with everybody,
                    the Census Bureau, with the INF, with everybody who has a piece of the action. I
                    think this is amazing, and it works better than any alternative that we could
                    come up with. Now, the other side, however, is that there has long been a school
                    of thought in the United States that, 'by God, if you want it done right you've
                    got to do it yourself.' In later years a version of this is 'we're the only
                    superpower, so we're going to have to stop terrorism.' The latest statement I
                    saw of that was from Jerry Bremer, who spoke about a study they made just
                    recentlyou may have seen ia few months ago. They studied terrorism and the
                    United States' responses to it. He was saying that we need a more military
                    capability to fight back and we need better intelligence to fight back. It was
                    interesting to me, because everything he said I could agree with. When you have
                    a rash of terrorist incidents, then the Congress gets all energized and they
                    want to spend money whether you want to or not. This happened to us in the
                    middle '80s and we tried to turn down money from the Republicans in the Congress
                    who wanted to give us more money because they wanted to be able to tell their
                    constituents that, by gosh, they were on top of it. Then, of course, we were the
                    moving target. If anything went wrong, it was our fault. We couldn't absorb that
                    kind of money that fast. That was when the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was
                    established back then. Now, though, with this thing that I found about this
                    report of the committee that Jerry Bremer...</p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>LONG: Ambassador Bremer followed Oakley as the head of the Counterterrorism
                    Office, and now he works, I think, for Kissinger up in New York. Ambassador
                    Bremer's statements about what we needed were correct, but I was struck more by
                    what he did not say than what he did say, because everything he did say had to
                    do with unilateral action. Terrorism, at least international terrorism, is not a
                    problem that any one country can handle. Like it or not, you have to have
                    cooperation with other countries, because most of it happens in other countries,
                    not all of it but most of it. He never talked about strengthening diplomatic
                    ties, about having more cooperation with “rude” statea stupid concept anyway to
                    mbecause that's where the bad guys are, and if you want to get the bad guys, you
                    want to at least try to lower the cooperation of states who put up with them.
                    This is not a bureaucratic or even an implementing policy problem of the State
                    Department or the other agencies or the counterterrorism policy in the United
                    States. This is a political decision as to whether we're going to send in the
                    Marines or the Delta Force or whoever we're going to send in, or whether we're
                    going to try not to send in some hot-shot diplomat when the balloon goes up to
                    think he can do anythinit's too late thebut over an extended period of time try
                    to increase general cooperation of the kind we got serendipitously when we
                    bombed Libya. To me that's the only way you're going to solve this. We do this
                    sporadically, we do this as people are interested in terrorism, when it comes up
                    on the scope, which is usually when some horrible crisis happens, and then the
                    rest of the time we're off looking somewhere else. So the weakness to me is not
                    an organization, institution, or bureaucratic weaknesI think we do very well on
                    thabut I don't think that we have or even want to admit that the United States
                    cannot go it alone, build bigger and stronger embassies and thereby somehow
                    lower the threat of terrorism. It's not going to happen.</p>

                    was exhausted from the time that I spent in Counterterrorism, and they gave me a
                    fellowship to go to Georgetown. I wrote a book, called The Anatomy of Terrorism,
                    to try to figure out what I'd been doing for the last couple of years, because
                    we never had time to even think about what we were doing. In fact, funny, just
                    before I retired I sent out...</p>

                <p>LONG: Not retired, but I mean left the office. Just before I left the office, I
                    sent out a little certificate that I made up. It said, “Veterans of Terrorist
                    Wars,” and it said, “Be it known that” and we then filled in the nam“is
                    honored...” and we made all this stuff up, and it was signed, “Muommar Qadhafi,
                    Grand Dragon.” Then we invited about 15 or 20 guys, anybody around, because we
                    had so many task forces that everybody almost knew their seayou know, “Hi, Dale.
                    Hi, Joe,” because we just had these things one after the other. So I got as many
                    people as I could think of and they could think of, and we had about 15 people
                    and we had a no-host lunch and we just all went and just sort of a reunion of
                    the veterans of terrorist wars. The funny thing about it, I started getting
                    messages from all over the room. “Why didn't I get my diploma or my certificate
                    or whatever you call it?” It was just a jokand they knew it, they knew it was in
                    fubut we sent about 40 or 50 of these things. It never dawned on me that there
                    were that many people that were not just involved in this but were really
                    seriously involved in these things, and there were.</p>

                <p>LONG: It really did. So I was exhausted, and they sent me to Georgetown and I
                    taught two years there. Then I taught two years at the Coast Guard Academy, and
                    then I went to Fort McNair, to INS, and actually was a senior person at the
                    Institute for National Strategic Studies. Then they told me I had to come back
