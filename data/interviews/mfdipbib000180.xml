                <p>Interviewed by: Mary Louise Weiss</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you tell me about the circumstances under which you
                        came into the Foreign Service yourself.</hi>

                <p>CALDWELL: In the Autumn of 1943, I was in the State Department of Education in
                    Missouri and I really wanted to do something in the war effort...something that
                    would be of service. And the State Superintendent of Schools knew I had
                    expressed an interest in the Foreign Service of the United States, and when he
                    was at a meeting in Washington, in the Office of the U.S. Commissioner of
                    Education, who was Mr. Studebaker at the time — Lloyd King, who was Missouri
                    State Superintendent of Schools, picked up an application for the Foreign
                    Service and brought it when he came back to Jefferson City. I talked to my
                    parents about it and the State Department had gotten very good publicity at this
                    time about how their young people were looked after in the Foreign Service. So,
                    My parents thought that if I really wanted to do this, it was fine. I filled out
                    the application — that was in about mid October. In less than a month, in
                    November 1943, I had a letter from the Foreign Service saying that I would be
                    given an assignment in the Foreign Service and to report to Washington
                    immediately (laughs). So after a farewell in the state capitol in Jefferson
                    City, and a farewell my parents gave me in our home, I left for Washington. And
                    I was very lucky in that I had a place to live in Washington. One of my closest
                    friends, Marg Lohman, also wanting to do something in the war effort, but who
                    felt she could not go abroad because she had two brothers in the service who
                    were in areas abroad, came to Washington and was director of one of the houses
                    at Arlington Farms. Arlington Farms, as perhaps all of you know, was housing for
                    government girls working in Washington or waiting for assignments abroad. So I
                    was in Washington — of course I was told to report immediately — I thought I'd
                    be going overseas immediately. I was in Washington five months. And during that
                    time I was given some orientation training and some training in cryptology. And
                    I also had a very good time because Marg and I are great lovers of music and
                    theater. Whenever there was an opportunity, we took advantage of what Washington
                    had to offer. But then in March, I received an assignment to the American
                    Embassy near the governments of Greece and Yugoslavia, then established in
                    Cairo, Egypt. And I was told to report to New York, and I, with about twenty
                    other Foreign Service girls, stayed in a hotel in New York and then we were
                    notified to go to the Navy Yard in Brooklyn, pick up helmets and gas masks and
                    proceed to Hoboken, and to board the ship the M. S. Mauritania. Now the
                    Mauritania had been declared fast enough to go on a solo wartime trip to
                    England, and so we — the captain of the ship to avoid German submarines in the
                    area — went through the very icy waters of the far north Atlantic, and we landed
                    in Liverpool at the end of March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the ship armed in any way, for protection, for its own
                        protection?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: No. It was not. It was just supposed to be fast enough to make the
                    trip. It carried all troops — well, there was an Officers Quarters and the
                    Foreign Service girls were given what had been staterooms and there were ten
                    bunks in each former stateroom. The thing I remember particularly about the trip
                    was the cold rain, and every morning we had to be on deck for a boat drill with
                    a panic bag which we had been told to pack before we left, which was supposed to
                    have some warm clothing and we had some, I don't know, K rations or some kind of
                    food that had been given to us. So with our panic bags we were standing on the
                    deck, and it seemed to rain every morning — very cold. But the crossing went
                    without any disaster. It was really uneventful, except for the cold. I suppose
                    that by doing this zigzag course, we avoided the German submarines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel frightened in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No. I think, you know, I wanted to do this and I was very excited about
                    doing it, and I just felt it would work out. And I really wasn't frightened,
                    amazingly enough. We were in England at a very interesting time. We did not know
                    but we were in England exactly one month before D-Day, which was May 6. At the
                    end of March and the first days of April, we were at Whittington Barracks near
                    the cathedral town of Lichfield, and several of us mentioned to the officers in
                    charge that we'd like to go to London. And we were given a very sharp reply,
                    “No.” And of course all preparations were being made for D-Day which was exactly
                    one month away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't tell you that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, no. Absolutely not. We certainly didn't know it. After about eight
                    days at Whittington Barracks — and of course it was all blackout — we were given
                    flashlights that we could have on only at certain times and held to the ground.
                    And there were blackout curtains in the barracks where we stayed. And then after
                    the eight days we were taken back to Liverpool and we were, all of us who were
                    going out in the Foreign Service, boarded the British troop ship, Orion, for the
                    trip through the Atlantic, through the Straits of Gibraltar, into the
                    Mediterranean and on to Port Said. We did have a little excitement soon after we
                    entered the Mediterranean. Apparently the convoy (we were in convoy for this
                    part of the voyage), and apparently the convoy had been sighted by German
                    reconnaissance planes and on two occasions smoke screens were put up that
                    entirely enveloped the convoy. That was a little exciting. Again, I didn't feel
                    afraid. I don't know. I guess I just thought it would all work out and I was
                    very happy I was doing what I wanted to do. So I really was not frightened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Young enough to accept it all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Young enough to accept it. I'm sure I wouldn't do it now. But we
                    arrived at Port Said and then took the train to Cairo. In Cairo we were met by
                    two officers from the embassy and I think they called them Kavass, anyway they
                    handled our luggage. We were divided into two groups: those who were going to
                    stay in Cairo and those who were going to Istanbul to go to other posts as soon
                    as the Germans had left, as soon as the countries were unoccupied. So I was with
                    the group staying in Cairo and we were taken to the Ismaeli Pension and it was
                    right in the heart of Cairo. We were close to the Kasr el Nile, the Bridge over
                    the Nile. On our balcony (we were about the sixth floor) we could see the
                    pyramids of Giza, which I found quite exciting. And we stayed in the Pension
                    about two weeks, but we decided this was not the way we wanted to live for what
                    we knew would be a few months — we didn't know for how long. So Margaret Ezzel
                    and I, after making inquiries about other places to live, moved to a Swiss owned
                    and operated hotel, the Carleton. It was not grand, as one would think of the
                    Ritz Carleton now, even then in Paris, but it was quite a comfortable hotel and
                    it was one we could afford. It was only a few blocks away from the Pension, so
                    we were still more or less in the middle of Cairo. And we lived there for the
                    five months before we went into Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. Oh, yes. We were. All the girls who stayed in Cairo were in the
                    code room. I felt this was kind of a letdown [laughter] in comparison to what I
                    had been doing, but we knew this was important and had to be done. And I suppose
                    in that sense we enjoyed it and we knew that there were many compensations.
                    There were so many things that we could do when we had any free time. Of course,
                    the first thing we wanted to do was go to Giza. This was when I met Bob, who
                    later became my husband. And because he had been in Cairo with his family when
                    he was about eleven years old and because he had a doctorate in classical
                    archaeology, he was a perfect guide to take us through the monuments of Cairo,
                    Luxor, ancient Thebes. So we did as many things as we could when time permitted.
                    It was not easy to travel around, but we did go to ancient Thebes and saw the
                    monuments there, and got to Alexandria. I had a trip to Jerusalem with the wife
                    of a Foreign Service officer, Sunny Hulick. Bob arrived in Cairo six months
                    before I did, and he had been to Jerusalem with a group of — I think from
                    American University in Cairo — but Sunny and I had a trip to Jerusalem. That was
                    the most traveling we could do because of wartime conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Bob was assigned to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right. He was assigned to the embassy, to Greece, but his office was
                    actually in the Legation to Cairo, it was not an Embassy at that time. That was
                    because the Legation needed an accounting officer. Of course Bob had never done
                    accounts in his life. But as one of our archaeological friends said, “Well, with
                    a good classical education, you can do anything.” [laughter] And so his first
                    assignment was in accounts. Then we, in November, the first week in November,
                    when the Germans left Athens and went north to Salonika or farther, the Embassy
                    moved into Athens, following the Greek government who went in about two days
                    before we did. We arrived — we went in two groups — most all of us. We were a
                    relatively small group — there were only seven officers and about six girls who
                    were secretaries, who went in, all except Wally Barber who was counselor of
                    Embassy and Bob who stayed behind to close up the Embassy in Cairo. The rest of
                    us went by ship - had a miserable crossing. I'm told that that crossing from
                    Cairo to Athens is always a rough crossing. But Bob and Wally Barber flew in and
                    arrived a day after we did having closed (it took us, I guess, four days to go)
                    having closed the Embassy in Cairo. At that time after Greece had been occupied
                    by the Nazis for five years in World War II, there were very few amenities in
                    Athens. Practically no housing. Our whole staff was housed in the American
                    School of Classical Studies on the slopes of Lycabettos a very beautiful place.
                    We came to love it — Bob had known it before. But the dormitory which had been
                    used by classical scholars (none of whom were at the school at this time because
                    of the war) became the dormitories for the single men and then the other hall
                    for the single women. The married officers lived in the houses. There was a
                    house at the Gennadeion — it's a very famous library and the librarian has a
                    house — this was a complex, if you can visualize it, of marble houses and in the
                    middle, the school. And then the Ambassador and Mrs. MacVeagh had the
                    librarian's house and the counselor of Embassy and Economic Counselor — there
                    were two houses for them. The rest of us lived in Loring Hall and we had a
                    dining room in Loring Hall which was for everyone. The senior officers
                    occasionally had dinner in their own houses but there was very little help, and
                    very little food, actually. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was an Embassy compound?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It was an Embassy compound at this time and we had been in Athens only
                    three weeks when the Communist Revolution started. And the girls and the wives
                    of the senior officers were not allowed out of the compound. We did have a
                    lovely garden, a walled garden that connected the school and the houses, and we
                    could at certain times walk in the garden. But we were not allowed to go to the
                    Embassy. The men went. There was quite a bit of sniper fire and shooting. We
                    actually had a bullet go through our dining room, and we all pointed out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were sitting there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: ...the hole in the wall. We weren't actually in the dining room. And
                    fortunately, no Embassy personnel was hurt. We did have an American who had come
                    into Greece in connection with a future aid mission who was killed at Amonia
                    Square. But we had no casualties. However, we had much shrapnel on our roof as
                    the British planes were shelling the Communist positions on the far side of the
                    Lycabettos and that was rather exciting. We had no electricity. We had no water.
                    There was a well at the back of the school from which all of the men took turns
                    carrying buckets of water. It was not drinkable, and I remember that we used
                    Halizone tablets, and so many were put in the water that it still was not
                    drinkable. So we drank as little water as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bucket brigade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Bucket brigade — absolutely.And there were no showers and of course no
                    tub baths. We had about a teacup of water apiece every morning and that was all.
                    But the “esprit d' corps” was shigh, and I think this from talking to other
                    people probably usually is true in the Foreign Service and perhaps in other
                    groups, when there is a crisis and things are very tight and there is some
                    danger involved. It seems to draw people closely together. And in the evenings,
                    of course Loring Hall had a beautiful drawing room — big marble mantel over a
                    fireplace (there was no wood for the fireplace) — but we sat with blankets
                    wrapped around our legs and around our shoulders, had candles on card tables,
                    and we often played bridge in the evening or just had conversation. It was a
                    very interesting time which I shall always remember because no one complained
                    although we had very little food and finally as we were running out of food that
                    had been brought with us from Cairo, a plane of rice was flown in from Cairo.
                    And then that was toward the end of the revolution. And I well remember the
                    first fresh food we had. Rodney Young, an archaeologist, (Bob and Rodney had
                    been at Hopkins together)...Rodney had come over in — I've forgotten his exact
                    assignment — he did not come as an archaeologist, he was there in preparation
                    for some aid groups coming in. And Rodney had a jeep and he'd been out in the
                    country and he'd found some carrots, and he brought these carrots into Loring
                    Hall. We thought they were like gold [laughter]. They looked absolutely
                    wonderful. We knew there was little food. In fact, there were Greeks who
                    unfortunately starved at that time because the Nazi occupation had been over
                    such a short time, there was no opportunity to get food into the shops or get
                    the people to grow things. It was a very severe time for all Greeks and our
                    local employees in the Embassy. We tried to share with them, with the local
                    employees.</p>

                <p>CALDWELL: What we did at this...</p>

                <p>CALDWELL: Oh well, during the revolution, typewriters were brought to Loring Hall
                    and all the girls who could type were asked to do the reports for the officers.
                    And I think we had the brown code books at that time, and we all did codeEven
                    some of the wives of the senior officers were pressed into service because there
                    was no one at the Embassy, at the Chancery, to do any of this work. So the
                    Ambassador would bring his reports, all the officers would bring whatever they
                    were writing. And we typed and we did coding and decoding of messages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these wives who pitched in, were they paid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No, no. That was voluntary. No wives were paid. In fact, this was an
                    interesting time in the Foreign Service. Bob and I, after the revolution, which
                    ended toward the end of January, 1945, and all Embassy staff members started
                    looking for housing. Some of the top officers found housing, and then of course
                    the residence which had been in Athens before the war was made ready for the
                    Ambassador. But the single officers also found some apartments. Bob found an
                    apartment in Kalonaki which is a very desirable place to live. It was a small
                    apartment. And then we actually were married in Athens in March. And Bob
                    hagotten the apartment as the other single officers had done early after the
                    revolution was over, so we had an apartment to go to. We were married on March
                    12th in 1945 in St Paul's Anglican Church in Athens. We have been back to the
                    church many times. It's a very lovely, small church. It's quite small, but it is
                    very, very beautiful. Then after a wedding breakfast at Loring Hall...well I
                    should say Ambassador McVeagh gave me away. One of the girls on the Embassy
                    staff, Ellen Broom, could play the organ so we had music. And after the wedding
                    breakfast at Loring Hall, Bob and I flew on a British aircraft to Rome for a two
                    week trip. The circumstances surrounding that were rather interesting because
                    Ambassador Kirk in Rome had not been at all happy about having people come to
                    Rome. But Athens had had quite a few of his staff, and though we had very little
                    food and very little accommodations to offer, we had taken care of them. And so
                    when Ambassador McVeagh had a cable sent to Ambassador Kirk that Bob and I were
                    coming to Rome, Ambassador Kirk cabled back that we should not come. So
                    Ambassador McVeagh's cable was very succinctly worded that he hoped Roman
                    hospitality would not be inferior to Athenian hospitality.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So we went. And actually we stayed at the Hassler Hotel which, if you know Rome,
                    is one of the loveliest hotels in Rome. It's at the top of the Piazza d'Espagna.
                    But this had been taken over by the American armed forces and the amount we paid
                    per day was infinitesimal. I can't remember whether it was two dollars per day.
                    Later, when we were in Rome, Peggy our youngest, had heard us say that we had
                    stayed at the Hassler, and so she said (she knew where it was) well, she would
                    like to go. So we went for lunch. And I will tell you that the price of lunch
                    for the three of us was as much as our two-weeks at the hotel when we stayed
                    there in 1945. Oh, I should say that after Bob and I were married, I did resign.
                    At that time, wives could not work. The only time I was employed was as a
                    temporary appointment when Bob was assigned on temporary duty to the Consulate
                    General in Salonika. And the Consulate was understaffed. It had only about three
                    people at that time, and it was necessary to have more help. So I was employed
                    on a temporary basis, with permission from Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were circumstances under which wives could be
                        hired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right. Just for...this was considered an emergency. There was no
                    housing in Salonika. We stayed at a British officers' mess. It was the
                    Mediterranean Palace Hotel which in peace time (we've been back) is a lovely
                    hotel. It faces the bay, looking out at Mount Olympus. But of course, everything
                    was very - what shall I say - it was not posh at all. [laughter] It just had the
                    bare essentials of rooms and then we had British rations for food. However, at
                    that time in Salonika there was a bit of fresh food and some fresh vegetables
                    coming into the town. And we did have an occasional fresh meal. But, not
                    many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You appreciated it all the more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: We appreciated it very much. Yes. The American Farm School which was
                    run by missionaries had tried to supply the few of us who were at the consulate
                    with some fresh things and these were very welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure they were. At this time you were not working any
                        more in the Embassy, but I know that you found plenty to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: I was very fortunate because Homer Davis who had been president of
                    Athens College for about twenty years but had to leave Greece during the war and
                    the college had been run by his assistant who was a Greek. Homer Davis asked if
                    I would teach at the college. It was rather an emergency situation because he
                    had no American teachers at the college. It was not possible to get
                    transportation for them. Only official people or people with medical problems,
                    that sort of person could get transportation. No way to get American teachers.
                    So I taught at Athens College for almost two years. I also did volunteer
                    teaching of English to some of the veterans of the Albanian campaign. This again
                    was a request. I never really lacked the things to do because we had made
                    friends when we first went into Greece and they knew that now that I was not
                    working in the Embassy, I was available. So it was very fortunate for me. Also,
                    we were very fortunate in having good friends among the archaeological
                    community. Carl Blegen whom most people know, a most distinguished American
                    archaeologist who excavated Troy and after that Pelos as the Greeks say, the
                    Palace of King Nestor, and Dr. Blegen's wife who is also an archaeologist, had
                    known Bob's family. In fact, Mrs. Blegen and Bob's father had taken their
                    doctorates together at Columbia University. So we were just included as part of
                    their family which was a marvelous thing. And I at one time was able to help Dr.
                    Blegen. He was preparing a manuscript — he was asked to do a rather popular book
                    on archeology, on Troy, and there was no one to help edit and to type some of
                    the manuscript, because he had no secretarial help. That, for me, was extremely
                    interesting. And we went on some trips with them, quite a number actually.
                    Later, we had the opportunity to be in Greece, and Dr. Blegen took Bob and me
                    and our daughter, Peggy, to Pelos and gave us a personal tour of the Palace.
                    That was a fascinating trip which we shall always remember. There was another
                    opportunity at this time which we appreciated. That was getting to know some of
                    the Greek people and getting to know them rather well. Since we were a small
                    group in the Embassy, and because many of the Greeks came to the Embassy for
                    reasons of mainly transportation to the United States or bringing some of their
                    families from the United States, which wasn't really possible, but they would
                    come to inquire. Also there were many remittances (I guess that's what you call
                    it — money) coming from Greeks in the United States to Greeks in Athens or in
                    the countryside of Greece. And of course they all had business in the consular
                    section of the Embassy. And Bob being the most junior officer was in the
                    consular section, and through his work, we had an opportunity to meet
                    outstanding Greek people who are still friends. In fact, they have visited us in
                    several of our posts, and they visit us here in Washington. Some of the people
                    we first met in Athens were Mary Carolou and her husband Chris Carolou. Chris'
                    mother had been lady-in-waiting to Queen Olga of Greece. And then later, Mary
                    was lady-in-waiting to Queen Frederika. But we got to know them because of their
                    family connections in the United States. And at this time in Greece it was
                    possible to make lasting friendships. In fact, Mary has visited us several times
                    and she is coming to Washington next week. At her house, we were invited to tea.
                    There were only six of us, and we met Princess Nicholas (Princess Helen). This
                    was a continuing friendship. Princess Nicholas was a Romanoff and much admired
                    by the Greeks. She was one of the few members of the Royal Family who stayed in
                    Greece all during the Nazi occupation. And she was much loved by all the Greeks.
                    And it was a rare opportunity to get to meet her in a small group. And on
                    several occasions afterward to be in her house, and to have tea in her garden
                    with just a few people. We treasured that friendship. Also, we met Prince
                    Philip's mother, Princess Alice, in similar circumstances, just a few of us at
                    tea. I mention this because now, with the embassy having so many staff members
                    and officers, it is not possible in the same way to get to know some of the
                    Greek people with whom we did form lasting friendships at that time. Also, we
                    had other friends from the archaeological community which meant a great deal to
                    us. Shirley Weber was the librarian at the Gennadeion. He and Elsa were great
                    friends of ours. And Dr. Bert Hodge Hill, I suppose at that time, our most
                    distinguished American archaeologist who excavated at Corinth for many years,
                    was a close friend. As a matter of fact, when we were looking for a different
                    place to live from the apartment, Mrs. Blegen asked us to live in their house
                    for six months. Dr. Blegen and Mrs. Blegen spent six months at the University of
                    Cincinnati and six months in Greece every year. While they were going to be in
                    the States, Mrs. Blegen suggested that we come and live in their house. The
                    servants would all be there, we would all be taken care of beautifully, and then
                    we could be looking for a house. These were six wonderful months in Athens. And
                    the house at 9 Plutarchou, was a well-known marble house of four stories and
                    beautifully furnished with a magnificent archaeological library, as well as a
                    smaller library of popular books. Agatha Christie was a good friend of the
                    Blegens. She was married of course to Dr. Mallowan, an archaeologist. So all of
                    her books were there and many other popular books. It was just a marvelous house
                    to live in. Later we met Agatha Christie in Pakistan, but that's getting ahead
                    of the story. The only time in our whole Foreign Service career that Bob and I
                    really were separated of necessity was when we were expecting our first child.
                    The Greek doctors had been isolated during the war years from all advanced
                    medical knowledge, and they felt there was a problem. So I came home in December
                    of 1946 and Bob followed in March of 1947.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A year later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Three months. Our son, Wally, was born in Barnes Hospital in St. Louis,
                    Missouri in April of '47, and when he was two-months old, we took him back to
                    Greece. We had another year and a half in the Embassy in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Bob was transferred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right. Bob was transferred directly from Athens to Dublin, to the
                    Embassy, to Ireland, well to Dublin, Ireland. We were in Dublin for
                    four-and-a-half years. At this time, again, in Dublin we had the opportunity in
                    our free time, to meet some of the archaeologists. And one memorable occasion, I
                    think, in that connection was a visit of Sir Leonard Wooley to Dublin. Sir
                    Leonard, of course, was the excavator of Ur and when we heard that he was coming
                    to give a lecture at the Royal Dublin Society, we telephoned Reggie Ross
                    Williamson in the British Embassy, who had excavated with Sir Leonard in Ur and
                    asked if there was anything being done for Sir Leonard after the lecture. There
                    wasn't, so Bob and Reggie decided that we would have a party and invite the
                    archaeological community of Dublin. Since Reggie lived in the country, the party
                    was at our house, which was only a few minutes from the Royal Dublin Society,
                    and this was our first opportunity to meet any of the archaeologists in Dublin.
                    One person, I think, is interesting to note who came to the party, was a Dr.
                    Gwynn, a Gaelic scholar who had an actual ear trumpet. I had heard of ear
                    trumpets all my life, but I didn't know that people actually used them. But he
                    had a trumpet at his ear that you had to talk in. I found that this was quite
                    fascinating. [laughs]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Historical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you become active yourself in archaeological
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: I did, in one way. Not as active as we had been in Athens, perhaps. But
                    in Dublin at that time many senior officials of the government, even bankers and
                    so on, didn't have cars. They used bicycles. And there were several rescue
                    operations for the museum in which the curator of the museum had no way to get
                    to these sites. And if Bob was busy, I sometimes took several of the
                    archeologists. I remember one of the rescue operations was a Viking boat from
                    the bogs. And it was extremely interesting to see how this had to be treated so
                    carefully when the air touched it because it had to be immediately immersed, as
                    I remember, in glycerine. But these were fascinating times. I did not do much in
                    Ireland in a volunteer way, because the Irish really did not want the diplomatic
                    community to help in their hospitals or with any kind of welfare work because
                    they wanted to take care of their own. There was very little opportunity to do
                    any kind of special service in Ireland. But it was a wonderful place to live. Of
                    course Wally was about a year and a half when we went to Dublin. Our second
                    child, George, was born in Dublin. And, of course, there is an old saying that I
                    think is true, that Ireland is a wonderful place to rear children and also for
                    horses and dogs. [laughter] Ireland had beautiful dogs. The dog show at the
                    Royal Dublin Society was a highlight of the social calendar.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a dog or a horse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: We had a dog, we didn't have a horse. [laughter] But we did enjoy the
                    races. We made some very good friends in Ireland with whom we kept in touch over
                    the years, and now two of these friends have died and we are in touch with their
                    children — both in Ireland and with those who have come to the States. And that
                    was a very satisfying experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bridge to the next generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right. From Dublin, Bob was transferred to Copenhagen. Copenhagen was
                    our longest assignment. We were there for five and a half years, which seems
                    almost unbelievable. I don't think it could happen now. But Bob went as an
                    officer in the political section and then was asked to be a labor attach�. At
                    that time, in the Eisenhower administration, there were certain positions that
                    were cut out, but that did not mean the Foreign Service officers job was. I mean
                    his position — he was not fired, in other words. So the labor attach� post was
                    cut, but Bob was asked to be Consul General in the Embassy in Copenhagen, so we
                    stayed another two and a half years. And it was a wonderful posting. I remember
                    arriving in December, about the middle of December, and Copenhagen in the snow,
                    was decorated for Christmas. I always think of what Karen Blixen wrote that
                    Copenhagen looks dressed in her best ball gown as the little white lights
                    sparkled all across — a garland across the streets, and it was just like a
                    fairyland. It was absolutely lovely. In Denmark we had many happy experiences
                    and we got to know, I would say, Danish people in almost all strata of society.
                    And this was extremely interesting. Again, there was not much opportunity for
                    any kind of volunteer service. The Danes are a very proud people and they did
                    not — just like the Irish — they did not want the diplomatic community helping.
                    However, with a few Embassy wives, I did work a bit with crippled children. And
                    every year we had, the American wives from the Embassy and Americans in the
                    community — business people — had a bazaar, and the money from that went to help
                    crippled children. That we were able to do. Otherwise, it was not very much that
                    we could do as a service to that community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your children in school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. Interestingly enough, our children went to Danish school. There
                    was an American school in Copenhagen, but it was, at that time, not very well
                    run, and we were anxious for our children to get to know Danish children and to
                    learn the Danish way of life, as well as to feel American. But we thought we
                    could provide the American feeling. And so Wally was five years old and went to
                    a Montessori kindergarten. And he learned Danish and went right into Danish
                    school in the first grade. He had four years in Danish school Tranegaard, and
                    his teacher paid him a great compliment, Frau Frokenmeyer, because the Danes
                    usually feel that no outsider can speak Danish like a Dane, but she told us that
                    (and Wally made “UG” which is the top grade in all his subjects) and Frau
                    Frokenmeyer said that if you didn't know Wally was an American boy, you would
                    think he was Danish born. His Danish was so good. George was very small, of
                    course, and he went to B�rnehave, which was first nursery school and then
                    kindergarten, And again, learned Danish, and Bob and I took Danish lessons, but
                    the boys would roll on the floor laughing when they heard us speak our Danish
                    because ours was very poor compared to theirs. Bob said he thought when he heard
                    the boys speaking Danish in their sleep, that was a test that they really knew
                    Danish. And Peggy was born in Copenhagen. I should mention this. Our youngest
                    was born in Copenhagen, and again a wonderful place for children. We made (I
                    mentioned making good friends in Denmark). It was for us a very satisfying
                    feeling (of course Peggy was too small) that the boys had their playmates and
                    their friends were Danish children. They met American children in social affairs
                    and liked them, but their main friends were the sons of Danes. And it was a
                    wonderful experience for the boys and for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were really immersed, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: They were immersed in Danish and (I'll tell you later about our posting
                    in Pakistan) but we said we probably were the only American family ever to
                    encourage their children to read comic books. But when we went to Pakistan, our
                    very wonderful Finnish maid whom we had for five years in Copenhagen, was so
                    devoted to the children. Toni sent comic books to the boys in Karachi. And of
                    course the comic books were in Danish, and we encouraged them to read them
                    because it helped them to keep their Danish for a while. Of course they didn't
                    keep it forever, but it was a wonderful experience for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you studying Danish yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. Bob and I yes, we took private lessons, and then, I guess, after
                    our first year in Copenhagen, the Embassy had employed a teacher and we took
                    Danish lessons. And we did speak Danish. Bob's Danish was different from mine.
                    He had the kind of vocabulary with which he could talk to Danish professional
                    people or business people or go to the Parliament and understand officials. Mine
                    was more of a household type. I did have to speak Danish socially occasionally
                    because some of the wives of professional men had not learned English to the
                    point that they could carry on much of a social conversation. I struggled with
                    it. I wasn't too good, but I did manage. However, I mainly used it for shopping
                    and in household ways.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in any way in the schools — in your

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: In Karachi, yes. Perhaps I should say that our next post after
                    Copenhagen was Karachi. We had been, at the end of our tour in Copenhagen, we
                    had been abroad for fifteen years without a home assignment. So we really
                    expected a post here in Washington. Bob had a call from the State Department
                    asking if he would go as labor attach� to Karachi. The Embassy had no person in
                    Labor Affairs. The AID mission had a man from the Labor movement and it was felt
                    that there was a need for a person in the Embassy who could work not only with
                    people in the Labor Movement but with employers and government. So Bob and I
                    discussed it and said yes, but only a two year assignment. That will be
                    seventeen years, and we needed for our children to go home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask. Did you have home leaves on a regular basis
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. Well, yes we did. Of course Copenhagen — we were three years
                    before home leave. but normally we had home leave after two years but not a
                    Washington assignment. But in Karachi I was on the Board of Education, the
                    School Board. It was an international school but we had an American principal of
                    the school and the curricula were based on the American system, and I was on the
                    School Board. Bob and I both worked with Scouts — Bob with Boy Scouts and I with
                    Cub Scouts with our children. We were in Pakistan from 1958 to 1960. And though
                    partition of India was 1948, there were still many, many refugee colonies in
                    Karachi. And there was very little work for many of these people. One of the
                    things I did in Karachi which I felt was not only interesting for me, but
                    perhaps was a small contribution to the society of Pakistan, was to be a part of
                    a small group helping the refugees to earn enough money to support themselves
                    and their families. What started out to be just a pleasure for me doing stone
                    rubbings from the Mugal Emperor tombs in Thatta turned out to be a very good
                    thing for giving employment to the refugees. The designs from these Mugal
                    Emperor tombs were very beautiful. Although they were Mugal tombs, some had been
                    Rajputs who had been converted to the Muslim faith; they still kept some of
                    their Rajput tenets. So there were some stones that had very beautiful designs
                    of animals, which, of course, the Muslims would not have done. And then other
                    tombs had designs of jewelry of chieftains wives. So when — there were about
                    four of us who — we would go whenever we could find the time to Thatta — it was
                    in the Sind desert, about sixty miles from Karachi. And of course the climate is
                    so hot, and in the Sind desert it was blistering hot — 120 degrees, perhaps.
                    There were times we would leave Karachi — four of us in the morning— at four o'
                    clock in order to be in Thatta in time to do some rubbings before the sun became
                    unbearable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a distance from where you were living.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: About sixty miles from Karachi. And when we would do a rubbing of a
                    chieftains wife's jewelry, we would do an extra one, and we gave it to Dorothy
                    Habib, an American girl married to a Pakistani doctor. She had started a cottage
                    industry to give work to some of the Muslim refugees. So we gave designs to
                    Dorothy. These were actually, not the jewelry — we gave those designs to the
                    silversmiths, and they did reproduce this jewelry and they sold it and from that
                    got enough income to really help them live. The other designs, which were
                    medallions and beautiful lotus designs, we gave to Dorothy, and her workmen —
                    some of them were skilled enough to cut woodblocks — and they were weaving cloth
                    (it was called a cudder cloth) and they used our designs to blockprint
                    materials. These were sold to the banks for draperies, to private houses as
                    upholstery materials or cushions or wall hangings. And it was a very satisfying
                    thing to be able to help these people in that way. We also did an extra rubbing
                    every time we made one to give to the museum. The designs were being partially
                    destroyed because in the desert the wind and the sand, working as abrasives,
                    were destroying some of these very beautiful designs. So as a preservation
                    project we gave a copy - not a copy - a rubbing to the museum. Shortly before we
                    left, the director of the museum, Dr. Kahn, who had become a good friend of ours
                    — we had been with him to his excavation at Bambour and various places — had a
                    presentation ceremony where we formally presented these rubbings to the museum
                    and they were exhibited. And the American ladies were thanked for doing this to
                    help preserve these designs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: They are indeed. Some are from Pakistan. Others are Hindu and Buddhist,
                    and so on, and some from Ethiopia. The ones you see are mostly from
                    Pakistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember an exhibit you gave of your rubbings.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, in the Smithsonian, right. They were from Pakistan. I had forgotten
                    that. You're absolutely right. I, with Jane Bunting, was asked to exhibit. Now
                    stone rubbings by the way, I must say, are very different from brass rubbings —
                    they have no connection with brass rubbings. The Smithsonian Institution asked
                    us to exhibit our designs from the Mugal Emperor tombs. So we did have an
                    exhibition at the Smithsonian, and those rubbings were taken on a two year
                    traveling exhibition of the Smithsonian going to about ten cities all across the
                    United States.</p>

                <p>CALDWELL: Well, predominantly. However, I was on School Board and then I, with

                    mostly pregnant women, and to underprivileged children. And we worked along with

                    State Department and we were in Washington four years. Those four years were, of
                    course, very interesting in that we had many associations with the Ceylonese
                    community and enjoyed them very much. We were also quite busy with three
                    children. Wally was in junior high, George in elementary school, and Peggy in
                    nursery school and kindergarten. So of course our lives were very busy with the
                    children's activities. But also we were involved in quite a few diplomatic
                    functions, and we enjoyed that posting very much.</p>

                    Honorable William Rogers, and his wife, Adele, was very active in the Foreign
                    Service wives group. And being on the Board, we occasionally had lunches to
                    which Mrs. Rogers came. She was a delightful person. She and her husband were
                    both Cornellians. The Caldwells are Cornellians for a hundred years. And she
                    would do such nice things as to say, “I'm going up for a Board of Trustees
                    meeting. Would you like for me to call Wally?” By that time our eldest son was
                    in Cornell. But we got to know the Rogers quite well and that was very wonderful
                    for us. They are delightful people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were both very supportive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Very supportive. And also at that time, the Secretary was very
                    supportive of some other work that I'll go into later that Bob was doing. Yes,
                    he was very supportive of all facets, I would say, of the Foreign Service, in
                    addition to all his duties as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as I remember, she was one Secretary's wife who came
                        to every function she could.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: She certainly did. And while I was on the Board, one year, Ann Penfield
                    was president of AAFSW, and she asked me to be in charge of the ball on the
                    eighth floor of the State Department for the Embassy children in Washington and
                    the Foreign Service children. And Mrs. Rogers, at our invitation, came to the
                    ball. We were just delighted. The Secretary was out of town, or she had
                    indicated that he would have come. But it was delightful to have her, and she
                    talked to these young people — the ones from our foreign embassies and our
                    Foreign Service young people, and was just so — she had such rapport with these
                    young people that it was quite impressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very at ease.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Very much at ease. From Washington, we were assigned to the American
                    Consulate General in Madras, India. We were in Madras for four and a half years
                    and we grew to love south India. We found the people extremely friendly and
                    relatively easy to get to know and to work with, and we enjoyed those four and a
                    half years very much. I will talk about some of the pleasant things first, and
                    then we did have one unhappy experience which I do want to record. But in India,
                    we had the first time in our Foreign Service career in which we left a child in
                    the States in school. Wally, our eldest, was...would have been in Woodrow Wilson
                    High School, but being posted in India, of course, he would have to go to
                    boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. How old was he then? Was he beginning high
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: He would have been second year of high school. So he would have been,
                    what, fourteen, I guess? I had to stop and think when he was in second year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was the second year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: So he went to Woodbury Forest, a prep school near Orange, Virginia.
                    It's an excellent school, and it's in historic Virginia. The school is built on
                    the estate of Thomas Madison, the brother of James Madison. The Madison House is
                    still there, and when Wally was in school, it was used as the Headmaster's
                    house. However, Baker Duncan became Headmaster, and decided — he had an
                    independent income — decided to build a house for the Headmaster because he felt
                    the Madison House always should be open to parents, students, and visitors. He
                    felt that a Headmaster, particularly like himself and his wife with young
                    children, just couldn't have the house open and available to every visitor. So
                    it now is open to the visitors and parents when they go to Woodbury Forest.
                    George was with us and he went to...he was in his last year of elementary school
                    (he would have been eighth grade)...so he went to the Hill Station of
                    Kodaikanal. It was an American school. The school had been originally
                    established as a school for missionary children. But it was expanded to include
                    the children of diplomats and business people. And the Hill Station of
                    Kodaikanal was 7,500 feet in elevation, where as of course, Madras we were sea
                    level. The trip from Madras by car was a long, ten hours until one reached the
                    bottom of the Ghat — the Ghat being the long, winding mountain road, which took
                    an hour. The first nine hours were very hot and tiring. But the school was well
                    run. It was run, of course, on the American system, and George spent a year
                    there and then he came home and he chose Woodbury Forest as the prep school he
                    wanted to go to. So he went to Woodbury Forest. Peggy was in school in Madras in
                    an international school, but it was run on the British system and most of the
                    children were British children. So she went two years to Harrington House but at
                    thend of that time, the British sent their children home to England to school,
                    and so we then sent Peggy to Kodaikanal to school for the remaining two years
                    that we were in Madras. And we felt that it was a good education. We did feel it
                    was necessary for the boys, at their level of schooling, to come home, because
                    we felt that they probably could not get quite the same caliber of education in
                    the senior grades as they could in an American prep school. But India was a very
                    rewarding post in that it was very active. And we, in going to India, knew that
                    the house, Bower, was a rather lovely residence. And Bob and I talked it over
                    and decided that we wanted to have on our walls some American Art. We had the
                    feeling, and it turned out to be true, that most Indians, even the well-educated
                    and rather cosmopolitan ones would know about French, German, even Russian art,
                    English art, but really didn't know that America had any art. So through the
                    National Gallery in Washington, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and our other
                    fine galleries, we selected reproductions of American art covering a really
                    three-hundred year period. In other words, it was just a survey of American art.
                    But these were excellent reproductions and made an interesting collection.
                    Entering the front door was a very wide at least...it would be eight feet
                    wide...hall that went the length of the big house. Perfect place to hang the
                    paintings. And we really had a gallery of American art. And many Indians
                    commented on this and two that I remember asked to borrow two of the pictures
                    because they were beginning art work. These were the wives of prominent business
                    people. They wanted to try to paint these paintings. Well, luckily, before we
                    bought the big reproductions, I had gotten smaller ones, so we could choose what
                    we wanted to take, and I was able to give them the smaller reproductions — I
                    didn't have to take the big painting off the wall. But in that connection, I
                    also was invited to lecture on American art at several of the colleges in
                    Madras. And I enjoyed doing this. It was through the files at USIS and through
                    our own slides, I was able to have an illustrated talk. Without it, it would
                    have meant very little to the Indians. But with an illustrated lecture on
                    American art, it meant a great deal. And I enjoyed doing that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask were these reproductions you had in
                        your home there...through the Art in Embassy Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No. Unfortunately, they were not. I think that through the Art in
                    Embassy Program we would have had originals, but these were ones we purchased
                    ourselves and were reproductions. But they were such fine quality. I remember
                    one instance, Mrs. Bowles the wife of our ambassador in New Delhi, was at our
                    house to lunch, and after lunch she and I sat in the hall (we had couches in the
                    hall) and she was looking at a Marin, and thought it was an original “The Isles
                    of Maine” and I was so pleased. It was a reproduction from the Philips Gallery
                    in Washington, but it looked so like the original. And I said, “Thank you very
                    much, although I'm afraid we couldn't afford the original.” [laughter] But they
                    were quite fine reproductions.</p>
                <p>We were able to help some young artists in Madras, which gave us pleasure. And it
                    really was a help to them in their work. We had an exhibition of the work of
                    about seven young artists...had in our house...had an exhibition of their art.
                    And then they were beginning to do batiks and they were doing very good work,
                    but they couldn't sell the batiks. And the Indian community didn't seem to know
                    much about this form of art and didn't buy it. So what we did was to have an
                    exhibition in the garden of their batiks. They brought all their equipment and
                    they demonstrated the making of a batik — had a beautiful, sunny day for it,
                    which was lovely — and the garden was a very big garden, so we could have a big
                    exhibition. And then we took down our paintings and hung their paintings in the
                    house. They sold a great many. We had about 450 women (I don't think there were
                    any men). We invited the Indian community of these outstanding women...we had
                    about 450...and we called it...like in America we'd have a silver tea, and of
                    course in the house tea, coffee, and cold drinks and cakes and so on were
                    served. And then they could see the art and they could see the batiks in the
                    garden. This stimulated a great deal of interest in these young artists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really launched their...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: We helped them launch their batiks and acquainting the Indian people
                    with what this form of art is. So it was something we enjoyed and it was a help
                    to these young artists. We got to know them quite well. On the other side,
                    talking about art, again on the stone rubbings. I am interested in stone
                    rubbings because of historical importance of them, and of course in Pakistan
                    the, I guess, preservation of the designs and also using the designs to help
                    people. But in India, it was mostly the historical significance of the rubbings
                    that interested me. One of the ones that I was asked to do came as a request
                    from the Yale family in Wales. Elihu Yale was governor of Madras and while he
                    was there he was married to an Indian lady. He and his wife had a son who died
                    at age four. (End of Tape 1)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...about Elihu Yale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Ambassador Bowles had had a letter from the Yale family in Wales asking
                    if he could get someone to find the tomb in Madras in which the four-year old
                    son of Elihu was buried, and if possible, have someone make a rubbing of the
                    stone. The Yale family particularly wanted to know if Elihu had used the Yale
                    family crest. And no one...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The child's tomb...you mean the child had died...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: At age four. But the tomb was not a child's tomb. It was a standing
                    pyramidal tomb, which of course I didn't know, but the brother of Elihu Yale's
                    wife had died, and this monument was used for the tomb for the brother and then
                    for Elihu's son. So, we did not know where the tomb was. There seemed to be no
                    records, except, I went to the church in Fort St. George and looked at the
                    records, and there had been an old cemetery in what was called the Guava Garden.
                    So after many excursions in the area of the High Court in what I thought was the
                    location of the old Guava Garden, we found this tomb. I was looking for a low
                    stone. I didn't know that it was this pyramidal tomb. And yes, the coat of arms
                    of the Yale family had been used. So I did a rubbing of it and through
                    Ambassador Bowles, sent it to the Yale family, and also made a rubbing for Yale
                    University which I was told was hanging in the library at Yale University. I
                    haven't been to Yale since I sent that. [laughter] Also, in Fort St. George,
                    since Elihu Yale was governor of Madras, and attended church at St. Mary's in
                    the fort, they had a history corner about Yale, and asked that I do a rubbing
                    for the history corner of the church. Our daughter Peggy was in India this
                    summer, and to her surprise, the rubbing is still hanging in the history corner
                    oSt. Mary's Church in Fort St. George. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left your mark in many places.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: You asked if all the rubbings were from tombs. Most of them were,
                    actually, in India — these were not exactly tombs, but they were Buddhist
                    Muslim, and Hindu temples. Actually, these Hindu temples are ones that are no
                    longer in use as places of worship. They have been declared monuments. Otherwise
                    I would not have been allowed to do rubbings. Also, there was an old Dutch
                    cemetery at Fort Geldria in south India that was about 35 miles south of Madras.
                    And so I did some rubbings from those stones which were early Dutch settlers in
                    India. One that was not a tomb and I thought was quite interesting was from the
                    palace of Tipu Sultan in the Fort of Bangalore which is in Mysore state in south
                    India. And of course that was one of the four states of south India that were
                    our consular district. This inscription is really calligraphy in stone —
                    beautiful calligraphy. It relates the defeat of Tipu Sultan by the British
                    general Cornwallis. And this defeat forced Tipu Sultan to cede most of the
                    Malabar coast to the British. Cornwallis won this battle; unlike his defeat at
                    Yorktown. And I thought that was most interesting. I enjoy the historical aspect
                    of the rubbings. While we were in Madras, I was asked to give exhibitions of
                    these rubbings in the capitols of the four southern states and also in the
                    archaeological museum in New Delhi. The director of the museum in New Delhi
                    called the director in Madras and asked if I had done a rubbing of the stone,
                    the Chakravati MendhatI had, and he asked especially that that be included in
                    the exhibition. And as the director of the museum in Madras knew, that stone had
                    never been let out of the museum in Madras, and in New Delhi they wanted to be
                    able to exhibit and show it to the people in that part of India. Chakravati
                    Mendhata meant Emperor of the World and his seven jewels, and those seven jewels
                    included his queen and his prime minister, his horse, his orb, sign of his
                    office, and his elephant and gavel as well as coins raining down from heaven,
                    which he was distributing to his subjects. So it was very interesting to know
                    that the Indians wanted to see the reproduction of their own Buddhist, Hindu,
                    Muslim, and Early Christian monuments. And I enjoyed doing that. Another thing
                    while we were in Madras...Bob and I were both asked to lecture on the USIS
                    University Program. And at that particular time, I was asked to lecture on the
                    role of women in the United States. I had to do a lot of work on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: That was 1967. We were in Madras from 1964 to '68, and that would have
                    been about 1967. While we were in India, all the wives of the Embassy were asked
                    to help in many social welfare programs. We worked alongside the Indian women in
                    their bazaars for raising money to help the underprivileged and there were also
                    leper colonies, and so on. But another project that the American consulate
                    general wives did, and I participated in this weekly, was to distribute milk.
                    Milk was brought into the country by one of our own American organizations — I
                    think it was the Care Program — and we went out to villages and distributed milk
                    to pregnant mothers and young children. And one thing about it that had never
                    occurred to me, but I was told that we must make the women and the children sit
                    down and drink the milk in front of us. If they went out of the compound where
                    we were distributing the milk, they would sell it. And so we had to see that
                    they drank it right there.</p>

                <p>We left India in 1968 for a posting in the Department of State. Bob was assigned
                    to the Office of Public Affairs. I think one of the most interesting things that
                    we did on this assignment was that I was able to participate a bit — Bob and I
                    more or less worked as a team in things as much as we could and enjoyed it. And
                    Bob started the Scholar Diplomat Program for the Department of State. In this
                    program which he had worked out with the various universities all over the
                    United States, relatively young professors of political science were brought
                    into the Department of State to see first hand the making of Foreign Policy. And
                    they had been security cleared and the arrangements had been worked out with
                    each university because there was no sponsoring, no money from the State
                    Department in paying these young professors' transportation or their living
                    expenses in Washington. So the universities were very much a part of the program
                    in that they supported it and they wanted their professors to have this
                    experience. Bob and I always had a meeting of the group — they kept the group
                    small — usually about sixteen or less and so that we always provided a
                    get-together, a small party for the scholars when they first came to Washington,
                    so they would get to know each other and we would get to know them. This program
                    was so successful that it has continued in the Department of State for over 15
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it still running?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It is. It's tapering off, now. But it is still going. In fact, this
                    would be twenty years, but it is tapering off now.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Earlier in the interview, I had mentioned that while we were in India that I
                    would talk about one unpleasant experience. And that happened during the Hindi
                    riots, as they were called. This waa language riot. It was when there was a
                    great movement in India to make Hindi the official language of all India. Well
                    the south, which is composed of Madras state, Mysore state, Andhra Pradesh and
                    Kerala — those four states did not want Hindi as their language. They wanted
                    their own languages. We had been in Trivandrum on an official visit to the
                    Consulate. We knew that there were riots in parts of south India. But the police
                    in Trivandrum checked with the consulate and said that it would be perfectly
                    safe for us to drive from Trivandrum to Madras. Well, we had been only about an
                    hour out of Trivandrum when we came to a small village of Gudulur. And there a
                    mob encircled our car and sat on the car, beat it with sticks, smeared paint on
                    it, threw a big rock through the windshield, and it was a terrifying experience.
                    Peggy was with us, and she was only nine years old. We were trying to inch our
                    way through the mob withouinjuring anyone. We finally got to the end of the
                    village where there was a police station. We went in — all the policemen were
                    having their siesta — but we were able to rouse them and they got a truck, and
                    with police on both sides of the truck, policemen with rifles, they escorted us
                    back through the village. And of course as they started to escort us back, no
                    one was in sight — everyone had disappeared. But they escorted us back through
                    the village to a back road leading to the High Range (a British tea center) to
                    Top Station. On the road a sign said, “an impassable road”. So we had a
                    hazardous journey in the dark to the High Range Club where, with the help of
                    some British people who were staying at the Club — they made room for us to
                    spend the night in the Club. The next day we made our way to Kodaikanal and
                    after a day to recuperate went back to Madras. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it about five hours back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It was about five hours back from Gudulur to Kodai. It was a long trip
                    and we literally moved boulders out of the road and fair-sized logs to get
                    through the roads. It was an excruciating experience. And a very terrifying
                    experience for a nine year old little girl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Washington you were assigned to Addis Ababa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. We were assigned to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. That was in 1972 and
                    we were in Ethiopia from 1972 to 1976. Ethiopia was a fascinating assignment for
                    all of us. Peggy was with us. She did not want to stay home in boarding school
                    and there was an American school in Addis. And so she had three years of high
                    school in Addis Ababa in the American school. The first year was not so good but
                    the last two years a new staff came — they were well qualified. She had a good
                    education and was valedictorian and was accepted at Cornell after her high
                    school experience in Ethiopia. In Addis I had an opportunity to work in a number
                    of welfare volunteer jobs. One was with the leprosarium. About ten miles out of
                    Addis Ababa there was a very fine hospital for lepers. The chief surgeon was an
                    Indian, Dr. Ernest Fritchie. We had known some of Dr. Fritchie's family in
                    Madras and so he and his wife had been told we were coming to Addis and they
                    immediately invited us to dinner. They had a house on the grounds of the
                    leprosarium and so right from the beginning, I began as a volunteer at the
                    leprosarium. What we did — there were several of us who got involved, Embassy
                    wives — was to try to help the patients at the leprosarium do something in the
                    way of handcrafts that would enable them to earn some money, so that when they
                    were dismissed from the hospital, they would have some means of livelihood.
                    There were about four of us who went regularly to the leprosarium and we taught
                    them macrame, among other handcrafts. It was a revelation to me that these —
                    they were both women and men (we worked mostly with the women) — most of them
                    had only stubs, I mean very short stubs for fingers. The disease had eaten away
                    their fingers. The same thing had happened to many of them with their toes. But
                    they could take these yarns for macrame and weave the designs we taught them.
                    Also they could do beautiful embroidery. The wife of our Embassy doctor had been
                    trained as a home economist, and she was able to show the women how to cut the
                    fabrics they wove. They actually wove a rather rough but pleasant cotton
                    material. Sue Babcock gave them patterns for cutting blouses and tops for
                    wearing with slacks that could be sold, primarily to Westerners but also to some
                    Ethiopians. One of the things...two things we felt we accomplished: one was that
                    we were able to disseminate information that leprosy is not communicable
                    through...it is communicable only by constant contact with the disease.
                    Therefore, these for instance, the tops and the blouses, after they were
                    carefully washed in boiling water, I might say, were quite safe to be worn, and
                    any handcrafts were quite safe to be used. One thing to promote the sale of
                    these, I had a coffee. We had a large Embassy house and garden, and Dr.
                    Fritchie's wife, Manu, brought quantities of handcrafts that the patients at the
                    hospital had woven or had embroidered or had sewed. It was a beautiful day in
                    Addis as most days are. So we had a big exhibition of the handcrafts in the
                    garden. We had coffee, tea, and cold drinks in the house. And we had several
                    hundred women who came and who bought these handcrafts, and the money went to
                    help these patients in the hospital. And we felt we had done two things: we had
                    been able to help these patients to earn a little money; we also helped to get
                    out the information that it was quite safe to buy these things. Later, not
                    because of us, but with a little help from us and from the officials from the
                    leprosarium, we obtained an outlet in the town of Addis where these things were
                    later sold in a shop. But we did initiate this and we felt very happy about
                    that. I also worked with the blind in Ethiopia. There were a number of blind
                    students at the University and I was asked by — we had a friend we had met at
                    the University — and he asked if I would help with teaching some of these blind
                    students. And I did enjoy that. I felt it was an interesting experience for me
                    and it did help them get through their years at the University.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your husband was assigned to ten countries — accredited to
                        ten countries in East Africa when you were there. Did that offer
                        opportunities for you to travel with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes. Fortunately it did. The first year we were there, I didn't travel
                    with him because Peggy was in high school and it was difficult for her to miss
                    school and it was difficult for me to leave her. But she came back to Cornell
                    University and I did travel with Bob. I traveled to all ten countries. Several
                    of the countries I went to more than once. I grew to know how great a country
                    East Africa is, how varied it is, how much natural beauty it has, and to get to
                    know people slightly — not as well, of course, as I did in Ethiopia — but to get
                    to know some of the people of each of these countries. We were fortunate to have
                    a weekend where we could occasionally on our trips to Kenya, go to the game
                    parks. And, of course, this is something everybody enjoys. Before Peggy left for
                    Cornell, we did manage a trip to the game parks with her and to some of the
                    other countries of East Africa. In Kenya, too, I would like to mention (I had
                    talked about Karen Blixen when we were in Denmark) I did go to Karen Blixen's
                    “farm” in Nairobi in the Ngong Hills and I was delighted with this opportunity.
                    Of course this section of Nairobi is now called Karen for Karen Blixen, and it
                    is not a farm but you can see the rolling hills and you can imagine what it was
                    like. And the house is charming — I was really fascinated by that. This was a
                    unique opportunity to see East Africa. Also we had, perhaps, a unique
                    opportunity in Ethiopia, to visit a great deal of the country, which the people
                    who came to the Embassy after our second year there were really not able to do
                    because when Haile Selassie was deposed, revolution followed, after which the
                    military government came into power and there was so much guerilla fighting and
                    unrest in all parts of Ethiopia that we were not allowed to go outside the city.
                    In fact, it wasn't too safe in the city. I remember on one trip when Bob had
                    gone to one of his other countries and I did not go, I would go to the Embassy
                    to collect the mail, but on several occasions Bob's secretary would call and
                    say, “Don't come because stones are being thrown by all the boys at the Prince
                    Makonin School...” [which we had to pass to get to the Embassy]. When we were
                    driving in Addis during those months, every time we saw a person on the street
                    bend down, we accelerated because we were sure they were picking up a big stone
                    to throw at our car. That seemed to be the chief way of harassing the Americans.
                    But Addis took on a completely different complexion in those last months than
                    heretofore, because all the streets and the squares of the town were lined with
                    a number of motorcycle policemen and helmeted policemen. And it took on an air
                    of revolution. One did not feel quite safe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were all the families allowed to stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Nobody was evacuated at that time. We left in '76 on a direct transfer
                    to Turkey. A few months after we left, families were evacuated. But we were very
                    fortunate that we were not evacuated, and no one was injured. We had some near
                    calamities, but there were no tragedies, fortunately. It was an unfortunate time
                    in Addis Ababa. It was also unpleasant in that it was not safe for friends whom
                    whad made during our first years — two years — in Addis to visit us because the
                    military government was very suspicious of Ethiopians who went to the houses of
                    Westerners and to diplomats. And some of our friends were imprisoned. This year
                    in Falls Church we had a visit from Elizabeth of Ethiopia. Had the monarchy come
                    back, her husband would have been the ruler. She had been imprisoned. Her
                    husband was imprisoned in the dungeon of the Gebby, as it's called, the old
                    palace, where he was imprisoned for seven years. Then after he was out of
                    prison, he was killed in a so called automobile accident. Some of these
                    accidents were arranged. It was always felt that his was arranged. But several
                    of our friends were imprisoned, and this was a very unhappy time. Before the
                    revolution, we had had two years of uninterrupted pleasure in Ethiopia and in
                    the other nine countries of East Africa.</p>
                <p>One very interesting experience for our family was the arrival of a team of
                    American anthropologists and a team of French anthropologists. The way we became
                    involved was that the teams arrived without a permit to excavate — work in the
                    field — although they thought it would be granted as soon as they came into the
                    country. These anthropologists and geologists were investigating an area called
                    the Hadar in Eastern Ethiopia. It was down in the lowlands, a very hot, arid,
                    barren part of the country and it was in the Rift Valley. And in the Rift Valley
                    there are few rivers now — they have dried up. But that's where fossils and
                    fossils of early man had been found by the Leakeys, although the Leakeys' finds
                    were in the Rift Valley in Kenya and in Tanzania. But it was a part of that same
                    Rift Valley. So Don Johanson, leader of the American team and Maurice Taieb as
                    head of the French team had come out to do some further exploration. Well, a
                    British archaeologist, Richard Wilding, had been contacted by Don Johanson to
                    see if he could help in getting the permit. Richard couldn't and he didn't have
                    contacts with the government officials that he might have had. He was in Addis
                    as a professor at the University. So he called Bob and asked if he would receive
                    these American and French anthropologists. And, of course, Bob was delighted.
                    And this started a two year friendship with these people while they were working
                    in Ethiopia, and that friendship has continued to the present time. A
                    representative of the Musee del 'Homme from Paris was with Maurice and then Don
                    had a team of three people to go out for an exploratory session — season in the
                    field — and then hopefully to come back for a longer season. Bob was able to
                    help them and their permit was granted after some days. I might add that these
                    young scholars had no money. Later when they came their finds which were really
                    quite extraordinary — they had financing from National Geographic and from the
                    National Science Foundation and they had enough money to carry on their work.
                    This time, they were really living on a shoestring. So our house became their
                    headquarters when they were not in the field. Well, that was quite all right
                    with us. They were fascinating people and we enjoyed them. Yes, we had a kind of
                    dormitory when they were not in the field.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The first excitement, and I remember it well, was after they got their permit and
                    took their Land Rovers and went down in the Hadar. Within about ten days they
                    returned. We saw these Land Rovers coming into our driveway. When they went down
                    to the field we had given them some food and then one person had indicated that
                    he was going to miss having cigars. Well Bob didn't smoke cigars but he happened
                    to have a box in the house so he gave them to him. When they came back from the
                    field, here came this cigar box with cotton in it and put out on our coffee
                    table, and there were what later proved to be 3.5 million year old hominid
                    fossils. And it was a very exciting day. So for two years while they were in the
                    field — of course they were only in Ethiopia for a period of several months each
                    year, and then they went back to their respective universities. Don now has
                    established the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley. We are in touch with him
                    and whenever he is in Washington, he stays with us and so we continue this, not
                    only professional relationship, but the friendship.</p>
                <p>Peggy had an interesting experience in being in the field with them for two weeks
                    to help close their expedition. This was at the time that there was guerilla
                    fighting very close to this area of the Hadar. The Embassy felt it was not safe
                    for our American and for the French anthropologistand geologist to remain there.
                    For some time we had been supplying them with food with a small airplane. Now it
                    was time to bring them out of the field and get their Land Rovers out because it
                    was not safe. So in order to close the work of the season as quickly as
                    possible, Don asked if Peggy could help them with cataloging and getting the
                    whole expedition closed up, not knowing when they would be able to return. She
                    did. And she now is a forensic anthropologist, and perhaps that experience might
                    have had some influence on how she decided on her career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she still in school there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: At first she was in the high school in Addis, and then, the next year,
                    she had come back from Cornell, and was on holiday.</p>
                <p>The finds have become famous. There is a book called “Lucy” [LucyThe Beginnings
                    of Humankind by Donald Johanson and Maitland Edey, published by Simon &amp;
                    Schuster, N.Y., 1981.] , and this tells about a forty percent complete skeleton
                    of a 3.5 million year old hominid (more than 60 separate pieces of bone). She
                    was about three feet five inches and she still is the oldest, most complete,
                    best-preserved skeleton of a hominid of that period. Don inscribed the copy of
                    “Lucy” which he sent us, “to Bob and Marthwithout your generous assistance,
                    “Lucy” might not have been found.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thrilling to have been a part of all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: It's very thrilling to have been a part of this exciting discovery and
                    to continue to be in touch with Don and Maurice. In January 1976, Bob received a
                    call from the Department of State asking if he would go on direct transfer as
                    Labor Attach� to Ankara, Turkey. Bob accepted this assignment with great
                    pleasure and knew it would be a very interesting post, as it did turn out to be.
                    So, in February of '76, we arrived in Ankara for a posting of nearly three
                    years. Actually Bob retired from the Foreign Service in 1979. Retired from
                    Ankara a bit before he had to retire, but he had always said he didn't want to
                    stay to the last minute, so he retired about six months before he had to retire.
                    We retired at post in Ankara, so that was 1979. Our three years in Ankara were,
                    for me, very interesting in that I did get to know quite a number of outstanding
                    Turkish people. Again, some have remained friends and have visited us here in
                    Washington and we telephone each other from time to time, and we also made
                    friends in the archaeological community. Dr. Akurgal, one of the most famous
                    classicists in Turkey, and Dr. Alp, a Hittite scholar, were two of our good
                    friends along with their wives. We, of course, went to Troy. One of our first
                    outings was to see Troy. I remember so well being at a meeting at the American
                    Officers Club of American wives in Ankara and mentioning that we were going to
                    Troy.And a wife of a businessman I had just met said, “Oh don't go to Troy,
                    There is nothing to see.” And I could hardly contain myself because, knowing Dr.
                    Blegen who after Schlieman and Dorpfeld had gotten all the levels straightened
                    out at Troy, I wanted to see Troy, and just to see the Plain of Troy, of course,
                    where the Trojan Horse was dragged up from the sea, but just to be there to me
                    would have been exciting. I told her I thought we'd enjoy it. We didn't expect
                    to see any monumental sculpture or buildings, but the walls of Troy, and we were
                    excited about it. We were not disappointed.</p>
                <p>When opportunities presented themselves, for instance, a long weekend, or if we
                    had local leave, we did take advantage of seeing many other historical and
                    archaeological sites in Turkey. Of course, Asia Minor with early Greek, Roman,
                    Byzantine, monuments — fascinating places. We did a trip around the southern
                    shore going to, well first, the Aegean, going to Ephesis and Miletus and Pirene
                    and then in the Mediterranean to the ancient Greek and Roman sites. This was
                    really a great pleasure. Also, partly because of our acquaintance with Dr. Alp
                    we had many interesting excursions to the Hittite sites. Dr. Alp is a well known
                    scholar who has been instrumental in, and is still working on deciphering some
                    of the Hittite script. And so we also saw Hittite monuments. On the community
                    service there — again I taught English. This time I was asked by USIS to be one
                    of several teachers of English to wives of professional men. These professional
                    men had learned English and used it rather well. The wives had not quite kept
                    pace. They wanted to improve their English and they felt it was important to
                    their husbands' professions that they know English. So a group of us from the
                    Embassy and some USIS wives taught in groups of never more than twelve and
                    usually about ten women. It was fascinating to teach English to this type of
                    person. Also, another factor that I enjoyed was that we had the classes in the
                    houses of each student. And that meant that I was able to get acquainted with
                    professional mens' wives with whom I might not have had a contact through the
                    Embassy. And to be in their homes and to see their way of life, I found from my
                    standpoint that that was a great plus. They enjoyed learning English, so it
                    worked both ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Before we left Ankara, Bob and I had a buffet supper for my “students” and their
                    husbands, and did have a chance to get to know these people a bit. This was more
                    of a superficial friendship. It is one that hasn't lasted, but it was extremely
                    interesting while I was there.</p>
                <p>For a while, I did have a hip problem (I won't go into that), but when I could I
                    went on the bookmobile to village schools. Through the military mission in
                    Ankara, we, Embassy wives, were provided a bus and a driver — small bus and
                    driver — van, I guess I should say and driver. We went to village schools and
                    distributed books. It was an absolutely enlightening experience for me to go
                    into a village school in Turkey and see the poverty of the whole situation. I
                    could not have imagined how important it was to take books to these young
                    students. They had no library in the school. They practically had no textbooks.
                    It was the poorest type of education I think I have ever seen. And I didn't
                    expect that in Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these young students? Were the books in English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: The books that we took...we took both. We took Turkish books. I don't
                    know about procurement of them. This was done by someone else. But the books
                    were about half and half...about half were in Turkish and half were in English.
                    I suppose the ones in English at first were used only to see the pictures, and
                    for the teacher to explain what the pictures were. Most of them were picture
                    books. I was appalled at the conditions in these village schools. These were
                    remote villages and they were very poor villages. The children had very poor
                    clothing. We did manage to get some clothes at times when we went to the
                    schools. And the children had very, I consider, inadequate lunches, and had very
                    little opportunity, it seemed to me, for real learning. And to distribute these
                    books meant a great deal in improving what little education I felt they were
                    getting. One experience I just want to mention...it was frightening and no one
                    was hurt. But in Turkey, one never wants to be friendly with dogs, especially
                    sheep dogs. Sheep are part of the livelihood of many of the villagers and the
                    people in the countryside. The dogs that are used to herd the sheep are enormous
                    dogs. These happened to be white, and they were as tall as what I would
                    say...taller than German shepherds. That is what I might compare them to — wolf
                    hounds...much bigger. And they had collars that had spikes about an inch long in
                    their collars. Of course these collars, the purpose of these collars was to
                    enable the dog to fight off the wolves who might threaten the flock of sheep. We
                    started out the door of the school and between us and the van in which we were
                    traveling was this big herd of sheep and about six of these enormous dogs with
                    these spiked collars. We retreated into the school to wait until the shepherd
                    got his flock and his dogs out of our way, and luckily we had enough sense not
                    to walk into that flock of sheep. [laughter]</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're continuing the interview. It is November 4 in Martha
                        Caldwell's apartment.Did you want to continue from where we left off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, yes. Excuse me, I didn't realize you wanted me to talk. I would
                    like to round it off in that we, Bob, retired from post while we were in Ankara,
                    retired from the Foreign Service. And we took a trip of two-and-a-half months in
                    Europe on our way home from Ankara. The purpose of the trip was to see friends
                    in many of, or some of the countries in which we had served. For instance, in
                    Greece we saw many of our Greek friends, in England and Ireland we saw our
                    English and Irish friends. We also, in Italy and other places, saw Foreign
                    Service colleagues. Some were American, some were other nationality Foreign
                    Service or diplomats of other countries. So that was, we felt, a very nice way
                    to end our career in the Foreign Service and have a chance to see again old
                    friends and colleagues. And then to come home and start our, I guess you would
                    say, retirement life, though it hasn't been retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But to be able to return, to go through those posts and
                        see your personal friends from a personal viewpoint, you were no longer
                        official at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No. This was just absolutely friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: And I think that is something that is significant. Many people would
                    feel the same way, that when you're on post and you meet people in the other
                    embassies and your own colleagues, it isn't just a friendship while you're
                    together. After you leave, some or quite a few of these friendships are
                    maintained and they're quite...you cherish those friendships. Not as
                    official...no longer as official friendships, but they are friendships for
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Martha, to go back to the other end, the very beginning of
                        your career in the Foreign Service — you were a young staff person during
                        World War II. Tell me what your expectations were at that time of the
                        Foreign Service as you entered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Career wise, I had no expectations. I was not interested in advancing
                    to an officer level, nor was I so concerned with what kind of work I did, as
                    long as I was doing something useful. I had come into the Service not to make it
                    as a career, but really to help out in a wartime situation. I had intended to,
                    after a few years in the Foreign Service, after the war was over, to return to
                    the United States and go back into the educational field.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have a chance to do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No. Not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were required to resign when you married. You married
                        in Athens, you were overseas at the time. Did you have any regrets about
                        your career at that time...that you were giving up, at that particular
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I had no regrets at all because I felt I could still be useful as a
                    Foreign Service wife and although I could not continue to work, I was sent with
                    Bob on temporary assignment to Salonika twice, to our Consulate General there to
                    help out. And I felt I would always have some opportunities to be useful. And
                    that is exactly why I came into the Service, so no I had no regrets
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you envision your role as a Foreign Service
                        wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I envisioned my role as a Foreign Service wife as, I guess the word I
                    should use, a helpmate. I felt very lucky to be marrying someone in a career in
                    which I could have a part. And I looked forward to having a part as a Foreign
                    Service wife in whatever way I could be helpful and useful. And I knew that Bob
                    and I would enjoy doing together whatever came. And that's the way it worked
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were two for the price of one? Had you

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Later I heard that expression many times, and I never even gave it a
                    thought because I was doing what I wanted to do. And I had no idea of being
                    paid...it never occurred to me...I didn't want to be paid. I wanted to be a part
                    of the life that Bob was leading and feeling that I could be a useful part. It
                    never occurred to me that there would come a time when this would be a
                    problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Actually, we were in only one Consulate General. We were in embassies
                    except in Madras. And I can say that from my standpoint, the relationship with
                    the mission and mission personnel was excellent. Bob and I were very happy that
                    our colleaguefrom New Delhi found reasons to come to south India and many were
                    entertained at Bower, our residence, and we got to know them as friends, from
                    Ambassador and Mrs. Bowles to other officers in the Embassy in New Delhi. We
                    felt this was a privilege. So far as I know the relations were excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to Delhi once in a while? I remember one
                        meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...at least. Was it an annual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Bob, of course, came to Delhi perhaps several times a year. I was in
                    Delhi only a few times, I guess only three or four times during our four and a
                    half years in south India. I enjoyed it immensely because the officers in the
                    Embassy treated us most cordially and these were pleasant experiences for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During your Washington assignments, '60-'64 and again
                        '68-'72, were you a member of the Association of American Foreign Service
                        Women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes, I was a member of Association of American Foreign Service Women
                    and in 1968, '69. '70, I was on the Board of AAFSW. During both assignments I
                    was active in the affairs of the Association. Of course, I was more active, I
                    suppose, as a member of the Board. I had two specific assignments. I was first
                    asked as a member of the Board to be in charge of teenage activities. This was
                    sort of what you made it. The principal part was a ball that was a tradition —
                    it had been done for a number of years at Christmastime — which included the
                    sons and daughters of foreign diplomats posted in Washington and the sons and
                    daughters of American Foreign Service people on assignment in Washington. And I
                    enjoyed...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that include the World Bank and IMF?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right, right...those other agencies. And in including those agencies,
                    we worked very closely with an organization called THIS, The Hospitality and
                    Information Service in getting the names of the young people and working with
                    them and arranging dinners before the ball and that sort of thing. We worked
                    very closely, our two organizations. I was in charge of the ball in the John
                    Quincy Adams Room in Christmas of 1969. I felt very fortunate that the wife of
                    the Secretary of State came as a guest to the ball. Adele Rogers, who always
                    insisted that those of us on the Board who had gotten to know her through small
                    groups and luncheons and so on, call her Adele. It was a little hard to do that.
                    She was a most delightful person and she gladly accepted the invitation to come
                    to the Christmas Ball. And I was very impressed with our young people — both the
                    American and the foreign diplomat children who seemed to show a great deal of
                    interest in the fact that the wife of the Secretary of State cared enough about,
                    well, shall we say, foreign affairs to come and represent her husband and
                    represent the Department of State. And, of course, personally, I was very
                    pleased. It added quite a nice note to the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope some of them had an opportunity to meet or talk
                        with her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, many of them did. The first ones to meet her were the ones who
                    formed a little committee which I had set up. Having a teenage son, our son
                    George, was at the ball that year. He was, I guess, at his senior year at
                    Woodbury Forest Prep School. Wally was in Cornell, but was for some reason, not
                    at that ball, as I recall. However, with George, I talked about having a little
                    committee of the American young people to act as hosts to the children of the
                    foreign diplomats. And without really emphasizing this, it was my hope that they
                    would see because of their behavior, everyone would be nicely behaved. And I
                    felt a little nervous at having the ball in those beautiful 18th century rooms.
                    And there 's always been an unwritten rule, I guess you would say, that no food
                    or drink would be taken into the John Quincy Adams Room which at that time, was
                    the most gorgeous of the rooms, because not all had been completed at that time
                    — the restoration of them. But the young people were absolutely marvelous. I
                    need not have worried about it. There was no problem whatsoever. I do think
                    having this group of American young people probably was a good idea. And they
                    enjoyed it. Now they were the first to meet Mrs. Rogers, but she mingled with
                    everybody and stayed for quite a little while and really talked with as many as
                    she could. She had great rapport with the young people. And she seemed to enjoy
                    it and I know the young people enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure they all did. How did the 1972 directive on the
                        status of Foreign Service wives, women affect your status role as a wife of
                        a senior Foreign Service officer? And therefore, in a more demanding
                        representational position in the former traditional sense.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: The '72 directive affected me not at all. I continued to do as I always
                    had done to entertain. Our life, of course, we had our family life. Our two boys
                    were back in the States in school. Peggy was with us the first time this
                    happened in Madras. She was at boarding school part of the time of necessity.
                    Our life was very busy in all kinds of representational activities. I look back
                    and recall that it was not unusual to have four or five activities, more or less
                    official, every day, and to have people in our house for dinner several times a
                    week, or to be out almost all the other nights of the week. This was all a part
                    of, what I felt, was the life of a Foreign Service wife, and I loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took it as a responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I did. And it was a happy responsibility. I was so pleased to have the
                    opportunity to get to know people in the country and to work in a
                    representational way as a Foreign Service wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find after that directive, and you were
                        abroad, that other wives did not feel the way you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I did, to a certain extent. In Madras, Addis Ababa, and Ankara, I did
                    find a difference. Well, in Madras it was just beginning to happen, because that
                    was just before the directive came out. In Addis and Ankara I did find that some
                    of the young wives of junior officers coming to the post had a little reticence
                    about being asked to do anything in a representational way. Several of them had
                    careers that they wanted to pursue. It was difficult as I'm sure many have
                    related. Foreign governments did not always give permission for these young
                    women to pursue the type of career for which they had been trained. But they
                    just had their own interests. And I know from the Ambassador's wife down, all of
                    us who were senior wives, were reluctant to ask these young wives to take part
                    in representational entertaining. I think those of us who were in the senior
                    category continued to do even a greater share rather than ask some of the young
                    wives who felt they were being “put upon”. And therefore we didn't ask them.
                    They were reluctant, so we thought to let them live their life as they wanted as
                    long as the rest of us could carry on and their husbands do their job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You understood their point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I understood their point of view absolutely. I didn't share it. I felt
                    they were missing a great deal, and I thought they were limiting their lives and
                    their activities in what could have been a very happy and, well, been a larger
                    kind of life had they participated. I felt they were really missing something.
                    But I understood that was not their point of view, and therefore I respected
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Martha, before the directive...two years before in
                        1970...weren't you involved in a committee...an ad hoc committee of the
                        AAFSW?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes, I was. I attended one specific meeting...I was involved in this a
                    little more than that...but I attended one specific meeting I'd like to mention.
                    That was the ad hoc women's committee meeting in October of 1970. All these
                    things that were happening were precursors, or they came, they were leading up
                    to what then became the 1972 directive. There was a group of women officers in
                    the Foreign Service agency who felt that the task force reports of July of '70
                    had virtually ignored women in drawing up a management strategy for the 70's.
                    And because of that they had a department-wide or agency-wide meeting to discuss
                    what they could do. This ad hoc committee did have a meeting with the then Under
                    Secretary of State, William B. Macomber, who was Under Secretary of State for
                    Management. He asked this committee to present its recommendations for
                    inclusions in the reports of the task forces. So they did make recommendations,
                    which included the abolition of any discriminations against women in
                    recruitment, promotion, training, career assignments and to bring an end,
                    recommending an end to any discriminatory practice against married women or
                    those who marry while in the Service. Following this the women officers had
                    another meeting in which I was asked to sit in as a representative of AAFSW
                    which was to discuss the implementation of their recommendations in subsequent
                    reports. The representative for the American Foreign Service Association was
                    Bill Harrop. At this meeting on October 22, 1970 in one of the small conference
                    rooms of the Department of State were representatives of the Department of
                    State, AID, USIA, the American Federation of Government Employees, the American
                    Foreign Service Association, and then I was representing the American
                    Association of Foreign Service Women. The ad hoc committee's chief spokesperson
                    was Mary Olmsted. My report on this meeting will be a part of the files.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I was very glad to have been asked by AAFSW to sit in on this meeting
                    and I did follow as best I could what happened after this all started, what I
                    would say, the ball rolling...before the '72 directive. I could not be involved
                    longer because we were assigned abroad. We went to the Embassy in Addis Ababa.
                    But I felt that the meeting I had attended and the background I had, led up to
                    what became the '72 directive. I was very glad to have been in on a small part
                    of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have any of your three children expressed an interest in
                        either the Foreign Service or any other kind of international service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CALDWELL: Our second child took the Foreign Service exams and, I'm happy to say,
                    passed them with very high marks...was put into the political cone...came to
                    Washington to the Foreign Service Institute and studied Farsi and went to the
                    embassy in Teheran. After he was there about a year, he began to write letters
                    expressing some dissatisfaction with the Service and his involvement in it. At
                    that time, we were in the Embassy in Ankara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: This would have been '76-'77. And I suppose it was '77, I don't have
                    the exact date. but George came to Ankara to talk to us about life in the
                    Foreign Service. He expressed, which pleased us, that he had enjoyed his life as
                    a Foreign Service child, but after being in the Service for about a year, as I
                    recall, he had decided that this was not the career for him. And he felt very
                    distressed about this, feeling that we might be unhappy about it. Bob and I were
                    not at all unhappy. We said “It's your decision”. We had never encouraged the
                    children to go into any specific profession, we left it entirely up to them. And
                    so we said, “If you're going to choose another career you're absolutely right to
                    do it now while you're young and can still do what you want to”. And so we were
                    not unhappy about it. George said, “I always want to travel and be involved in
                    certain aspects of foreign relations, foreign affairs, but I want to be based at
                    home. I want to have a career in political science at home.” And that's what
                    he's doing and we are very pleased.</p>
                <p>As for the other children, our eldest expressed no interest whatsoever in living
                    abroad. He, too, likes to travel, but his interests lay actually in theology. So
                    he is happily settled in a profession (Episcopal priest) here in the United
                    States and that's exactly what he wants. Peggy is a forensic anthropologist. And
                    she was so happy in her life abroad. India, of course, was the last post where
                    she spent the entire time with us, because from our next post, Addis Ababa, she
                    came back to Cornell to the university. She feels a great rapport with Indian
                    people. As a matter of fact, this summer she spent...no, in the spring, from
                    April to July, she spent three months in India and it was the greatest
                    satisfaction and pleasure to her to be back among Indian professional people and
                    all of the Indian people with whom she was working this summer. She went back as
                    an anthropologist. It was very interesting that in Mysore (she had gone with her
                    professor of anthropology at Cornell and his wife and a graduate student), there
                    were the four of them on this trip. And they went over to meet the Director of
                    Archaeology in Mysore. And when Peggy walked in, the Director of Archaeology,
                    Dr. Rao, said to Peggy. “Are you by any chance the daughter of Bob and Martha
                    Caldwell?” Dr. Rao remembered Bob and me from our stay in south India and Peggy
                    was delighted. She found that working with the anthropologists and the forensic
                    people in India was a great thrill, because she loves India, she loves Indian
                    people, she loves Indian food. She just found that she still had great rapport
                    with them and enjoyed it tremendously. I think she does not particularly aspire
                    to a life in the Foreign Service. She is right now back at Rutgers University
                    doing her Ph.D. and intends to continue her career as a forensic
                    anthropologist.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a nice story. What do you sense now is the morale in
                        the Foreign Service? Do you have an opportunity to hear young persons
                        talking about or do you have much contact...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: We have quite a bit of contact. And unhappily, I find that morale is
                    low. We have contacts with several young Foreign Service officers, one of whom
                    sought Bob's advice about going in the Foreign Service, and as Bob always does,
                    he gives the pros and cons and leaves it up to the young person to make the
                    decision. But there are problems in the Service now. It is of much concern to
                    both Bob and me as I know it is to many others of our generation of Foreign
                    Service officers and their wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't Bob active in DACOR (Diplomatic and Consular
                        Officers Retired) and has something to do with bringing the new generation
                        with the older generation of retired...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, very much so. Bob is on the Board of Governors of DACOR...has been
                    now, this is his second term, I think, of three years each. Yes. DACOR is very
                    interested in having some impact, some influence, perhaps, in trying to raise,
                    trying to I should say improve the conditions that would raise morale among the
                    young people. And DACOR right now is in the midst of discussing ways in which it
                    can play an active part in trying to create this esprit de corps which we always
                    felt and which we feel is so necessary in a career of service like our American
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that a continuing program...with the retired
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It is a continuing program...right...and more emphasis now is being
                    placed on it than at any previous time that Bob has been on the Board, Bob has
                    been a member of DACOR from the very earliest times that an active duty officer
                    could become an associate member, which was about twenty-six years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: But now, there is a distinct focus on trying to do something in
                    connection with young Foreign Service officers and being helpful in any way that
                    DACOR can. It's an ongoing program and it's getting a great deal of attention
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Glad to hear that. Martha, you were always very actively
                        involved at your posts abroad in community work of many kinds. What keeps

                <p>CALDWELL: Again, I find that it's a privilege to be able to do some things in
                    which both Bob and I are interested.</p>
                <p>(End of Tape 2, Side B)Tape III, Side A</p>
                <p>CALDWELL: ..an opportunity to work along with Bob on some of the activities in
                    which DACOR is interested. I too, of course, am a member of DACOR, although I
                    have no official capacity. What I do most is work in connection with an
                    organization (it's a philanthropic and educational organization)...I am not shy
                    in saying that I'm a 50 year member, so this tells my age, but you know it from
                    being a retired Foreign Service officer's wife...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...to be proud of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: But this organization...We own a college and give international
                    scholarships for graduate work in the United States. This has a stipulation. We
                    give these grants of several thousands of dollars to foreign students and the
                    stipulation is that these students will return to their own countries and use in
                    their own countries the skills and the knowledge that they get from their
                    graduate work here in the United States. We feel that's very important. We have
                    an educational loan fund with a very low interest rate — I think it's 4% which
                    sounds like nothing now — for undergraduates. Thus far, I would say, that these
                    are for young women. We do not have young men in this program yet. But we do
                    have this loan program for undergraduates, and then our newest program...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me the name of this or would you prefer not
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, yes. We use the initials PEO. It's a philanthropic and educational
                    organization. Actually the letters do not mean that and I should put this on
                    record. PEO was started as a sorority and then it went off campus deciding that
                    it would be a more continuing type of program for its members in later life than
                    just sororities. So it started as a sorority but used English letters instead of
                    Greek letters. So I say that, but that's not what the letters mean, but that's
                    what it is. Our latest program which I think is a fine program, is called
                    Continuing Education. We give grants of money...these are not loans...well, our
                    scholarships are not loans, those are outright grants, too. Women who for some
                    reason have left the work force, probably because of marriage and who find
                    themselves in a position now that they must reenter the workforce, perhaps
                    through divorce or the death of a spouse or for some economic reasons, and need
                    to upgrade their skills, can apply for these grants. We give grants to these
                    women to pursue their education further to make it possible for them to be
                    earning workers in our present day situation.</p>

                        occasionally at AAFSW...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Oh, I continue my association with AAFSW and I go to the meetings as
                    often as I can. I'm very interested in the progress that AAFSW has made and the
                    growth of its interests. I'm also extremely interested in the organization
                    because I find now that the young women who are the present president, and the
                    immediate past president, are former colleagues, young wives of young officers
                    who served with us in Ethiopia or Turkey. And I want to do anything I can to
                    promote their work. I think it's splendid that they are taking over these
                    positions of responsibility. So I do see them and, of course, give any
                    encouragement I can. I'm not as active as I have been. I also do other volunteer
                    work. Right now I'm not doing any volunteer work for the blind. That's on my
                    list. I do work for volunteer agencies...the shelters and the food for the
                    homeless, too.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very long and contributing life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It's been extremely interesting. As I think I said once before on the
                    tape, I wouldn't change a thing [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything you'd like to add? I was thinking of the
                        benefit tea that we had for this project at DACOR Bacon House when you and
                        Doris Metcalf who had gone into the Service during World War II in the
                        Foreign Service Auxiliary, and there was June Byrne, our first president, at
                        the other end of the room and she herself had gone in at the same
                        time...gone abroad as a Foreign Service secretary, I believe. In the living
                        room, Ann Kauzlarich was sitting down alone, our newest president, and I
                        thought, she and the first president might like to meet. And then you came
                        over and joined the little group there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: This was a great pleasure for me because without your doing this, I
                    might not have realized that the present president, Ann Kauzlarich and her
                    husband Sean, and Bob and I had served together. Ann reminded me (I, of course,
                    then recognized her). Ann reminded me that she and her husband arrived in Addis
                    shortly before Bob and I left. So I didn't get to know them very well, but I
                    knew her as a bright, young wife and I certainly will follow her career as
                    president of AAFSW...follow it with great interest. The immediate past
                    president, Susan Donnelly, also I feel a great interest in what she has done and
                    what she is doing for AAFSW. She and her husband were in the Embassy in Addis
                    and I knew that Susan, I felt very sure that Susan, would continue her interest
                    in Foreign Service life and women. She was extremely active in Addis Ababa in
                    all the activities in which the wives could participate. So during her term as
                    president I did have a chance...we did have a chance to continue...to renew and
                    continue our friendship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The thing that strikes me so satisfying about this is that
                        the generation that is now out and retired has a continuing interest and
                        loyalty and support for the newest ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: I hope this will always be true. I think it's very important. It does
                    establish that link and that continuity that I think...I share with you...is
                    very important. In closing, I do want to mention that when Bob and I were at the
                    Consulate General in Madras, Mary Lou and her husband were at the Embassy in
                    Delhi, and when I mentioned that our relationships, so far as I knew, between
                    the Consulate General and the Embassy were all pleasant, I was thinking very
                    much of Mary Lou and Leonard who did come to Madras and we saw them in Delhi.
                    It's a great pleasure for me to continue this friendship with Mary Lou through
                    our activities in AAFSW and in this Oral History Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, Martha.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the 6th of February 1989. I am with Martha
                        Caldwell again for a continuation-addition on the tape. Martha, you told me
                        that church activities played a great role in your life and continued to do
                        so while you were in the Foreign Service. I wonder if you would tell us a
                        little about that. Each post was different in relation to your church and
                        Bob's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Absolutely, and I would be delighted to tell you about it. As I look
                    back, I realize that continuing church activities abroad, at first in my Foreign
                    Service career, was not altogether easy because I was living in an Islamic
                    environment. However, both Bob and I were interested in some kind of church
                    service. Due to his knowing quite a few professors at American University,
                    Cairo, he more or less ferreted out this church group which was organized by,
                    and attended largely by, professors and staff of American University, Cairo.
                    Both of us had grown up in church-oriented families. My father was a deacon in
                    the Baptist church; my mother was the daughter of a Baptist minister. Bob's
                    father was an elder in the Presbyterian Church. You may wonder later when I talk
                    about the Episcopal and Anglican Church. Yes, we did become affiliated with the
                    Anglican and later the Episcopal Church because in most countries where we
                    served the British had built an Anglican church, and that was sometimes the only
                    church available. The Anglican-Episcopal service is one we both love, and we
                    really wanted to be active participants.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>But to go back, the church service in Cairo was held in an upstairs room of a
                    building which was in the middle of Cairo, and the services were in the evening.
                    I remember after church we often walked over to the old Shepherd's Hotel and had
                    supper in the garden of that famous old hotel which was quite a gathering place
                    for international groups. It was a rather exotic old hotel for those who
                    remember it. With its Moorish decor, it was quite intriguing to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the building where the service was held in an office
                        building, or an embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It was not in an embassy. As I recall, it was an office building. I
                    know that we went upstairs in what I think was an ordinary office building. I'm
                    a little vague on it, but I know it was not a church-related nor an American
                    University-related building. Bob knew the American University quite well. He had
                    an introduction to Dean Badeau (John S.), whom you may remember. He later became
                    our American ambassador to Egypt. At that time he was on the staff of American
                    University as was Dr. Smith, the Acting President. They were friends of Bob's,
                    and Bob did a little volunteer work for the university since they were short of
                    staff. That's how we found out about the church service which was really our
                    only church life in Cairo. We did go out to visit two old Coptic sites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this on your own, or part of a church activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No, it was on our own. At that time both of us were seeing the old city
                    of Cairo with its ancient walls, and many mosques. We also were going to
                    out-of-the-way places which maybe not everybody visited — such as the Coptic
                    sites.</p>
                <p>I was in Cairo only six months so it wasn't a long period of time. Going from
                    Cairo into Athens, we found the atmosphere totally different. There our church
                    life centered around St. Paul's Anglican Church, in which we were married. Also,
                    in a church-related way I found it quite exciting to stand on the Aeropagus
                    where St. Paul (The Apostle of Christ) had given his speech on the unknown God.
                    Climbing up the Aeropagus, which as you know is the “Hill of Ares” (the war
                    god), situated at the foot of the Acropolis overlooking the Agora, always was an
                    interesting experience.</p>
                <p>Also, we were in Corinth many times. In Corinth in the Agora there still exists
                    the old Bema with its big blocks of stone, which was a lecture platform. It was
                    a platform from which the Greek elders of the city made pronouncements and from
                    which St. Paul preached.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Getting to know some of the Greek Orthodox church people was most interesting.
                    Two of these had the same name. I remember Archbishop Athenagoras who was
                    Archbishop of North and South America, and the other was Bishop Athenagoras of
                    Boston. The third distinguished member of the clergy was Pantaliamon, Bishop of
                    Edessa and Pelle and ex-Arch of the Dodacanese. We got to know all three quite
                    well. I remember that Archbishop Athenagoras in New York asked Bob and me to
                    call on him when we were coming on home leave. We did call on him at the St.
                    Moritz, a Greek-owned hotel on the park (Central Park). When Bishop Athenagoras
                    from Boston knew we were in New York, he called Bob and then he came to see us.
                    The last time he had been in Athens, he knew that there seemed to be a problem
                    about the birth of our first child, so he came to New York to see us and to see
                    Wally.</p>
                <p>Bishop Pantaliamon we saw occasionally in the house of our Greek friends, the
                    Carolous. It happened that when Bob and I had gone to Rhodes on a Greek war
                    relief ship to deliver supplies, Bishop Pantaliamon was in Rhodes. Our first
                    night at dinner in the hotel the waiter brought us two beautiful partridges,
                    sent to our table by Bishop Pantaliamon. At that time special food in the
                    Dodecanese was not readily available — the food was rather uninteresting and
                    certainly not gourmet — the partridges were a great treat. Bishop Pantaliamon
                    had heard from our Greek friends, the Carolous, that we were in Rhodes. The next
                    day he was leaving for Kos and Patmos and invited Bob to go with him, and we
                    thought how interesting that would be. I was not included, but never mind.
                    Unfortunately, the authorities would not let them go because there had been a
                    storm at sea and some of the mines that had been put down by German submarines
                    in World War II could have broken their moorings. It might not have been safe.
                    Of course Bob was disappointed.</p>
                <p>From Athens we went to Ireland. There, just a block and a half away from where we
                    lived when we first were in Dublin, was the Church of St. Bartholomew, Church of
                    Ireland. That was the equivalent of the Anglican Church — it's all in the
                    Anglican communion. We went a time or two, but we found the services very grim
                    indeed. It was a beautiful church, but it was dark and cold inside. Usually
                    there were only about six people at the services; sometimes there was no music,
                    sometimes very little music. We decided that was not for us at all. So during
                    our stay in Dublin we attended the Presbyterian Church in Rathgar and enjoyed
                    that very much and took Wally to Sunday School there.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The other thing about church connections in Dublin that rather intrigued me was
                    that the Kielys, close Irish friends, had a very long relationship with Father
                    O'Connor, who was the O'Connor Don of the O'Connors of Connaught. My mother's
                    mother was an O'Connor. However, when that family came to the States it became
                    Protestant. They dropped the “O” and they were Connors. I grew up seeing a book
                    in the house, The O'Connors of Connaught. Father O'Connor was a Jesuit. He and
                    Paddy Kiely had been in university together where their friendship began. We
                    often were included at lunch on Sundays or other occasions. Father O'Connor
                    invited us to Clon Alice which is the present seat of the O'Connor Don. Father
                    O'Connor was writing an updated history of the family. He showed me the
                    manuscript which I was fascinated to see. The last I knew, his book had not been
                    published. We had many fascinating conversations about family, and I was
                    interested in seeing Clon Alice, the family seat.</p>
                <p>From Dublin we went to Copenhagen, where we attended St. Alban's Anglican Church.
                    Those who know Copenhagen will have seen St. Alban's because the church is just
                    a step away from the Gefion Fountain. Bob was on the church council and I was on
                    the church council part of the time representing Ambassador Robert Coe. British
                    churches overseas had a chaplain. They were churches to the British Embassy, and
                    instead of a rector or a vicar, the person in charge was called Chaplain. The
                    chaplain was chaplain to the British Ambassador. Because quite a few Americans
                    went to the church, the American ambassador was invited to be on the church
                    council. Ambassador Coe found that he couldn't go to the church council meetings
                    very often so he asked me to sit in for him. I was interested to know the
                    workings of the church and I was interested in the people.</p>
                <p>Princess Viggo was on the church council. It happened that she and her husband,
                    Prince Viggo, and Bob and I became good friends. She was the daughter of Hetty
                    Greene. That may not mean much to many people, but Hetty Greene was a rather
                    well-known person in Brooklyn, a large landowner who distrusted banks. It was
                    always said that her money was kept under the mattress, which Princess Viggo
                    said was true. But what interested us more than that was that her doctor had
                    been Dr. Frank Eddy Caldwell, Bob's grandfather.</p>
                <p>St. Alban's is a lovely church. It is quite small. It had no place for a Sunday
                    School except the vestry which would hold about ten children. We had a large
                    number of American children who wanted a Sunday School. So Bob and I together
                    with Henry and Hood Barringer started an American Sunday School. It was held in
                    the educational building attached to the Danish Army Church. It looked like a
                    school room. I remember the children at Sunday School sitting at desks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a group was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: We had over fifty, sometimes over sixty. We averaged from forty to
                    sixty children. We operated the Sunday School with the help of the American Army
                    chaplain in Wiesbaden, who came once or twice a month. We got our Sunday School
                    materials from him.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Through my uncle, Jesse Horton, my mother's brother, who was Executive Secretary
                    of the Northern Baptist Convention, we met Dr. and Mrs. Johannes Norgaard. My
                    uncle Jesse Horton, through the World Council of Churches, had known Dr.
                    Norgaard who lived in Tollose, a small town about ten miles outside of
                    Copenhagen. And the Norgaards became good friends during our five-and-a-half
                    years in Denmark. One of their sons was in seminary. When he was in Copenhagen
                    he often helped out at the Sunday School which was fine because he was trained.
                    That was quite an experience for us, and it meant that while our children went
                    to Danish schools, the Sunday School provided an opportunity for them to have
                    more American children as friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the children in the SundaSchool mostly
                        English-speaking, or were they British, American, diplomatic...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: They were all English-speaking. As I recall, they were all American
                    children. The children's parents were connected either with embassy or with
                    American businesses in Copenhagen. I remember an American who was representing
                    TWA, for example. The Sunday School proved to be quite a happy experience for
                    all of us who were involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of the children of confirmation age, or were
                        there any baptisms there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: There were no baptisms and there were no confirmations. That would have
                    been difficult because we had a little makeshift altar set up. Having only an
                    occasional visit from the chaplain, there were no confirmation classes. This was
                    strictly Sunday School.</p>
                <p>In connection with our involvement at St. Alban's, Bob, who was on the church
                    council, was asked to prepare the service, (I don't mean the talk that was
                    given), but to outline the service for Ruth Bryan Owen Rohde, who some may
                    remember as being Ambassador to Denmark (1933-36). By the time she died she was
                    living in Denmark, and there was a memorial service at St. Albans. Bob was asked
                    to make all the arrangements for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>From Copenhagen we went to another Islamic environment in Karachi. But Karachi,
                    of course, was a city that had had many British connections, and there was an
                    Anglican church which we attended. One thing that I remember specifically about
                    that church was the bishop. We became good friends, and for some reason he and
                    Bob talked together about many scholarly things. One evening at dinner he said
                    that he had been involved in helping a group translate the Bible into the
                    Tibetan language. He told us at length the story of getting the Bibles by mule
                    caravans into Tibet. He gave Bob at least two copies of this Tibetan Bible which
                    Bob (brought) when he came home. Bob gave a copy to Wheaton College in Illinois,
                    which was Billy Graham's college, and where my cousin, my Uncle Jesse Horton's
                    daughter's husband, was assistant to the president. So one of the Tibetan
                    Bibles, as far as I know, still resides in Wheaton College in Illinois.</p>
                <p>From Karachi we came home and our church life centered around the Episcopal
                    Church in Chevy Chase (Md.). We were active and the children were in Sunday
                    School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were able to continue their Sunday School life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Right. Then we went to Madras. In Madras we were extremely active in
                    the church. Again there was an Anglican church although to be exactly correct
                    the churches had amalgamated and these Protestant churches were called the
                    Church of South India. The church that we attended is historic indeed. It is St.
                    Mary's in the Fort (Fort St. George) and the oldest (built 1678-80, the first
                    English church in India) Anglican church still in use east of Suez. I think I
                    mentioned that when Peggy our daughter was in India this summer, she went back
                    to St. Mary's and it's still very much in use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Fort St. George?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes, Fort St. George in Madras. Fort St. George was built on the land
                    the British had bought from the Vijayanagar kingdom, and that was the first
                    settlement of Madras (founded in 1644). Bob was on the church council of St.
                    Mary's church all the time we were there. I was very active also. In our house
                    or our garden seemed to be all the receptions for incoming and outgoing
                    chaplains. We were quite involved. There was a Sunday School there for the
                    children. It was small but our children attended. We were very lucky in that we
                    had excellent chaplains. It was difficult to have chaplains in that part of the
                    world when there was little money to pay them, but these chaplains were provided
                    partly by the mission to seamen. In addition to being chaplains of the church,
                    they also administered to seamen who came in on the ships. They were fine
                    people. Wally Andrews, I remember, was Welsh; the next chaplain Seldon Hadlow,
                    was from New Zealand and we still keep in touch with him and his family.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, was this congregation a collection or a group of
                        foreigners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: This congregation was made up principally of British, Americans, and
                    many Indians. So that made it fascinating because we had lovely friends among
                    the Indian community who attended that church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't the Christian community in South India especially
                        high due to the background of missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Very high, and Kerala has the largest Christian population in India
                    (one quarter of the population in 1962). We have said this sometimes and people
                    don't understand it, but Kerala has the largest number of Christians and is the
                    only, or it was at that time, Communist state in India. It has the highest
                    percentage of educated people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very high literacy rate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: It's true in Kerala that some of the tram conductors held degrees from
                    universities. They were highly educated people. There was another interesting
                    group in Kerala that I'll just mention and those were the Jews, the White Jews,
                    the ones who had come from the Diaspora. You'll know more about that probably
                    than I do. It was a very small, a very select group. We were invited by the head
                    of that group, his name was S.S. Koder, I believe — it's been a long time since
                    I've thought of this — to visit the synagogue in Cochin. It was beautiful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It (was) still a community when we were there (but down to
                        only twenty or so members).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Very small, and they would not marry outside their own group, so it was
                    dwindling. I was told when we were there that there were about 90 in the group,
                    and I'm told it's now dwindled to about 20 people. Peggy inquired about it when
                    she was there because she remembered Mr. Koder and the visit to the
                    synagogue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We visited that tiny little community and learned the
                        background of the synagogue. (Those called White Jews were expelled from
                        Portugal in the 16th century. Some who came earlier, called Black Jews, are
                        claimed to have fled from Jerusalem in the 3rd and 4th centuries.)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Do you remember the church, the synagogue? It was a lovely little
                    building. I remember particularly the tiles. They showed us, of course, the
                    whole synagogue, but I remember especially the very beautiful Chinese tiles that
                    had been brought by sea. Trade between China and Kerala flourished from early
                    times.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Another point of interest was St. Thomas because the legend is, (but it seems to
                    be more than a legend — there are many books that substantiate this), that St.
                    Thomas (the apostle of Jesus Christ) did missionary work in India. He, it is
                    said, landed at Mylapore in Kerala, so of course we visited Mylapore. We also
                    knew well St. Thomas Mount which was between the city of Madras and the airport.
                    Anybody who went from Madras to the airport would see the small mound. It is
                    called Mount San Thom� or St. Thomas. (There) is also a church in Mylapore, a
                    suburb of Madras, which was called San Thom�. The story is — and I don't know if
                    there is authentication for this — but the story is that St. Thomas' bones when
                    he died, were buried in that church, and later were moved. Legend has it that he
                    died on St. Thomas Mount. He supposedly was shot with an arrow when he was just
                    below the Mount and made his way to the top of the mount. There is now a small
                    church built over the site where he is supposed to have died. There is a rock, a
                    stone, on which are stains which are believed to be the stains of blood where
                    St. Thomas fell.</p>
                <p>I was asked to do a rubbing from a stone on the porch of that church which rather
                    intrigued me. That stone had an inscription in Armenian and a heart with an
                    arrow through it representing the bleeding heart of St. Thomas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe when we visited you in Madras you might have
                        been the one who took us to see this church. I remember looking at the
                        cemetery, the gravestones by the little church.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Yes, indeed. It's a little church that is held in high esteem. It was
                    originally Armenian. It now is under the direction of the Roman Catholic Church.
                    (End of tape III)</p>
                <p>For our second posting in Washington we took a house in Kensington (Maryland). We
                    had bought a house in American University Park (Washington, DC) on our first
                    posting, but at the time we came back from Madras in 1968 we did not want to
                    send Peggy to the schools in American University Park, which would have been
                    Alice Deal Junior High and Woodrow Wilson High School. There were a great many
                    problems in the schools at that time. We investigated school systems and were
                    told that among the best would be Kensington. Peggy had one year in elementary
                    school and then went into Newport Junior High. She got a good education and we
                    were quite pleased.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We were affiliated with Christ Church, Kensington, and both Bob and I were active
                    in the church. I was on the altar guild for a short time before we went to Addis
                    Ababa. Nothing very special except that Peggy was confirmed while we were in
                    Kensington and we were attending Christ Church. The rector and his wife became
                    good friends of ours. While we were in Ethiopia, Bob's brother and his wife had
                    moved from Baltimore to Kensington and they attended Christ Church. They
                    reported to us regularly that a prayer was said for us on Sunday mornings during
                    the revolutionary days in Addis Ababa, praying for our safety, and we thought
                    that was rather splendid.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: In 1972 we were posted to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Coptic Church in
                    Ethiopia is a very old Christian church. Christianity goes back to the third
                    century A.D.In Addis Ababa there also was an Anglican church, St. Matthew's. We
                    arrived in Ethiopia in August. The schools were not in session and in the first
                    week we were there I began to think about friends for Peggy without her waiting
                    until school started. This was going to be difficult. I looked in the phone book
                    under British or Anglican church, found the church number and called Philip
                    Cousins to inquire about the church and its activities. Philip said, “How did
                    you find us”? I said it wasn't very difficult; I just used the phone book! Peggy
                    made friends among the church young people. Philip and Janet Cousins became
                    close friends and still are. Philip now is the dean of the Cathedral in Cairo.
                    He and Janet visited us last summer.</p>
                <p>Soon after we arrived in Addis, Philip asked Bob to be chaplain's warden, and we
                    became quite involved in church activities. The Anglican church, I may have
                    mentioned, does not have an altar guild per se. The wife of the chaplain is
                    called on to do all the necessary things. That's a big job, and (since) Janet
                    was teaching at the English school, a few of us wives did a great deal to help
                    out on what would have been an altar guild. We were very close to that church
                    and we loved it. We had twenty-two nationalities attending. It was extremely
                    colorful! We have a number of photographs of the garden in which after church we
                    had tea and coffee. The women from East and West Africa and from Asia wore their
                    native clothes, and it was so colorful that when we went to our next post,
                    people looked so drab — all wore Western clothes. We were not only active in the
                    church but also in helping with visitors to the church. The rectory was
                    extremely small and the Cousins had two lovely young children, Paul and Rachel.
                    It was difficult for them to do a great deal of entertaining so we helped.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>One occasion that I would like to mention particularly was a dinner party we had
                    for Bishop Spofford. His title was Vicar General of Jerusalem, and he was in
                    Addis for a very short time. One evening he and the Cousins and a few other
                    church people came to dinner at our house. Philip mentioned to Peggy just before
                    dinner that Bishop Spofford was president of the D'Oyly Carte Society in London.
                    This being the 100th anniversary of D'Oyly Carte made it a very special year.
                    Peggy went over to the stereo and put on “The Mikado”, and Bishop Spofford was
                    just so pleased. He then told us that he had arranged for this 100th anniversary
                    to have every Gilbert and Sullivan production performed in a two-week period, at
                    the Savoy (the Savoy Theatre, London, built by Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1881 to
                    house Gilbert and Sullivan operas). He arranged one performance before dinner,
                    and then dinner at the Savoy Hotel, and then a performance after dinner. And in
                    doing that for two weeks they were able to perform every production of Gilbert
                    and Sullivan. We found this fascinating because we like Gilbert and Sullivan and
                    still have many recordings. Peggy sang with the Savoyards at Cornell. She is a
                    great devotee of Gilbert and Sullivan.</p>
                <p>Another thing about Bishop Spofford was brought to light when he saw a tile on
                    the table which had a sketch of a church in Fulton, Missouri.It is a church that
                    was erected, or I should say re-erected in Fulton, Missouri as a memorial to
                    Winston Churchill who gave his famous Iron Curtain speech at Westminster College
                    there. (The president of the college at that time was Franc “Bullet” McCluer, an
                    old friend of ours. I had worked with him a bit on the Missouri Constitutional
                    Convention at one time ) This tile pictures a church which had been bombed in
                    England but not totally destroyed. The stones were there and they were carefully
                    numbered, brought to and re-erected in Fulton. It is a beautiful church, a
                    beautiful memorial. Bishop Spofford told us that he was chairman of the
                    committee which received the people from Fulton when they came to England to try
                    to select a fitting memorial for Churchill. He suggested this churc[The Church
                    of St. Mary the Virgin, Alder-Manbury, a 12th Century London church redesigned
                    in 1677 by Sir Christopher Wren.] and the committee thought it a fine idea, and
                    that's how the church came to be in Fulton. He was an extremely interesting man,
                    and with our church and Gilbert and Sullivan connection, you can imagine we had
                    a happy evening.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Another church-related activity in Addis Ababa was our church group's trip to the
                    Rock-Cut Churches of Lalibela. King Lalibela in the 13th century was extremely
                    upset that there could be no pilgrimages to the Holy Land because it was under
                    the control of the Muslims. Therefore he had churches hewn out of living rock.
                    They're magnificent. They're really wonderful works of sculpture and
                    architecture. Because there could be no visits to the Holy Land, Lalibela would
                    take the place of Jerusalem. Lalibela is a very small village. The only way to
                    get into the village is by muleback or to fly in on a small plane and land on a
                    meadow. So a group, I think the plane held fifteen, fifteen of us from St.
                    Matthew'Church went to Lalibela. Our trip was just before the revolution, before
                    Addis Ababa was in turmoil after Haile Selassie was deposed. Our plane was the
                    last one to fly into Lalibela before some very startling events. The next plane
                    which flew in was blown up on the airstrip, the meadow. The people were allowed
                    to get off the plane but the plane was blown up. There was almost no way for a
                    modern vehicle, a car or even a jeep to get in or out of Lalibela. As I said,
                    muleback was the only way.These people were stranded. There was a tiny hotel
                    called the Mount of Olives, appropriately named for the Mount of Olives outside
                    Jerusalem. These people were AID (Agency for International Development). They
                    were housed in the Mount of Olives Hotel for about two weeks until Land Rovers
                    managed to get over this terrain and bring them out. It was a hazardous trip and
                    they were extremely lucky to get out without any injuries or fatalities. The
                    last time we had heard of any people trying to go into Lalibela by jeep they had
                    been killed. We felt extremely lucky to have been able to fly in and have a tour
                    of these wonderful churches and get out safely.</p>
                <p>When we left Addis, as a gift to Bob as the chaplain's warden, a lovely
                    boo[”Churches in Rock” by Georg Gerster. Phaidon Press Ltd., 5 Cromwell Place,
                    London, S.W.7.] on the Rock-Cut Churches of Lalibela was presented to us by the
                    church. It's rather nicely inscribed and the script is beautiful. We treasure
                    this book. In the church in Addis, having so many different nationalities and
                    such active people, we formed friendships among the Indians, the West Africans,
                    the East Africans, and the British. We cherish the years in Addis Ababa and our
                    connections with St. Matthew's Church.After Addis in 1976 we (had a direct
                    transfer) to Ankara. Ankara is ancient Ancyra, the capital of Galatia. St.
                    Paul's book to the Galatians was delivered to the early church people in Ancyra,
                    which is now Ankara, the capital of Turkey. I'll tell you first about our own
                    church. Again it was an Anglican church. It was St. Nicolas Church, built on a
                    little “piece of pie” within the compound of the British Embassy. Ataturk had
                    decreed in 1922 after he became president of Turkey that no more Christian
                    churches could be built. Those in existence could operate. There was no Anglican
                    church in Ankara at that time. The Anglican church had been in Istanbul, which
                    of course had been the Ottoman Empire capital, “The Sublime Port”. So the only
                    way to have an Anglican church in Ankara was to build it on British property,
                    and that meant building it in the British compound. It was a charming church. It
                    was small. It was designed by a Scandinavian, a Finnish architect. We loved that
                    church. It was beautiful, and we had many happy associations with the people of
                    this church. David Palmer was the chaplain and he almost immediately asked Bob
                    to be his warden. Since David was a bachelor, obviously I, as the warden's wife,
                    became active on what should have been an altar guild. David and we became and
                    remain close friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Toward the end of our stay, the bishop transferred David from Ankara to Rome.
                    Shortly before we left Ankara, Bob and I had a holiday in Sicily and we flew
                    back to Rome on Christmas Eve to attend David's church. He has visited us here
                    in the United States several times. He was with us just a year ago, and so we
                    have continued our friendship.</p>
                <p>St. Nicolas church was fascinating. We didn't have the twenty-two
                    nationalitiewhich we had in Addis, but we had a few Scandinavians, Greeks, many
                    British and some Americans. Because St. Nicolas was the patron Saint, always on
                    St. Nicolas Day, which is December 6, the church had evensong, and after the
                    service it was the custom to go to someone's house and have a reception. That
                    reception was almost always at our house. We had about eighty people every time
                    and the tradition was to serve mulled wine and small mince pies. Well, I don't
                    make small mince pies so Bob and I supplied the mulled wine and the British
                    ladies supplied the small mince pies.</p>
                <p>The church planned an expedition to the bishopric of St. Nicolas which was at
                    Myra on the Southern shore. Myra is known in Christian circles, also, because it
                    was from the port of Myra that St. Paul embarked on one of his missionary
                    journeys. A busload of thirty-eight of us from St. Nicolas went to Myra over the
                    Thanksgiving holiday. It seems strange because that was not a British holiday,
                    but it was determined that that would be a good time to go. Actually the bus
                    tour was a little treacherous because we had a big snowstorm. We knew it would
                    be a long full day's drive and that we would not arrive until after dark, in
                    Antalya which was a few miles from Myra and the place (where) we would spend the
                    night. Bob and I, with help from our staff, prepared turkey sandwiches and I've
                    forgotten what else, a little snack lunch. We would then arrive in Antalya and
                    have a late dinner. That lunch was welcome because with the snow it made the
                    trip much slower and we did not have time to stop any place for lunch. In fact,
                    we were too late for dinner at the hotel.</p>
                <p>We had a happy group on that trip. We went to Termessos, a famous ancient site
                    which was one of the few places that Alexander did not conquer on his way
                    through to the East because it is situated on a hill. I would say the hill is
                    probably 7,000 feet straight up, actually a steep sided mountain. Alexander
                    decided it was too dangerous to try to scale the hill and take the town.
                    Termessos survived. This ancient Roman city of Termessos survives, however, only
                    in ruins because an earthquake partially demolished many of the temples, the
                    Agora and buildings, but there is enough of the theater, enough of the city gate
                    left that it is a beautiful site worth visiting. It is a long climb. One has to
                    leave any motor transportation at the foot of the mountain and climb, but we
                    did. It's a little treacherous in the snow but we were glad we did it. One other
                    time in Turkey we made that trip by car ourselves and we went to Termessos in
                    the Spring. It was much easier than it was in the snow. We were glad we saw it.
                    The trip to Myra we shall long remember because the St. Nicolas Church was very
                    special to us and going to the seat of the St. Nicolas' bishopric really meant a
                    great deal to all of us.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>I do want to end with one other point of interest. When we were in Addis, Bob was
                    accredited to ten countries in East Africa. One of those countries was Malawi.
                    Malawi is the heart of Livingstone country. We took a seven-day trip, cruise on
                    Lake Malawi, which formerly was called Lake Tanganyika. And then it became Lake
                    Nyasa, which is a contradiction of terms. Nyasa means lake, so in Swahili it is
                    Lake Lake but was known as Lake Nyasa, now Lake Malawi. It's an inland sea. To
                    traverse it took seven days and we stopped at twelve ports. Two of the ports we
                    called at were heavily involved in the Livingstone story. (David Livingstone,
                    Scottish missionary and explorer in Africa 1841-52). Livingstone had his small
                    mission at one of these sites on the lake and the second one — Likoma — had a
                    church built entirely by missionaries, none of whom was an architect. It is a
                    small replica of the Cathedral of Winchester in England. And it was unbelievable
                    to see this small cathedral in the proportions of a great cathedral in England
                    built entirely by missionaries who had no training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: Sandstone, local sandstone. Of all the treks which Livingstone made
                    through the bush from that part of the heart of Africa naturally we have read in
                    several books, one in particular, Livingstone's Lake by Oliver Ransford,
                    published by Murray of London.</p>
                <p>In closing I do want to mention two missionary doctors whom we knew. In Karachi
                    Dr. Henry Holland, a missionary doctor, was an ophthalmologist and most of the
                    people in the hinterland of Pakistan had no access to skilled surgeons. He was
                    so famous and so in demand that even in his eighties he would stop at train
                    stations to perform cataract operations and was never paid by any of these
                    people. We came to know him, his son, also a doctor, and his daughter-in-law.
                    They were at our house for dinner several times. They were marvelous people and
                    the work they did in Pakistan was outstanding. The son and daughter-in-law still
                    live in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he American?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CALDWELL: No, he was British. Dr. Henry Holland has died. The book called The
                    Frontier Doctor chronicles his life. A wonderful man and a great surgeon and a
                    great humanitarian.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The other person is Dr. Ida B. Scudder who comes from a long line of medical
                    missionaries. The Scudder family have been missionaries for years in the Middle
                    East, in the Arabian peninsula, and in India. Dr. Ida, Dr. Ida B's aunt, was the
                    founder of the hospital in Vellore, which was the first hospital to train women
                    doctors in India. There were many muslim doctors in India who were all men, and
                    the muslim families would not let these male doctors treat their wives. Many
                    women died because of lack of medical attention. When young Ida Scudder coming
                    from boarding school in the U.S. visited her family in India, she made the
                    statement, repeated to us by Dr. Ida B., her niece, “Well I'm never ever going
                    to come to India and carry on the tradition of my family. I'm not going to do
                    this.” There was a story that in Kerala where some of her family lived, a man
                    came to her father who was a medical missionary, and said his wife was extremely
                    ill. But of course Dr. Scudder, the male doctor in his family, was not allowed
                    to visit her and what could he prescribe? Well, you know doctors are very
                    reluctant without seeing a patient or even knowing what the symptoms are, to
                    prescribe medication. The woman died. Dr. Ida B. told us that while her Aunt Ida
                    was in Kerala she changed her mind about practicing medicine in India. Ida
                    Scudder not only came back to India but she founded the first hospital in
                    Vellore to train women doctors in India who would be permitted by their families
                    to treat muslim women. Vellore started as a very small training hospital. It has
                    now grown, it is international in scope (and) has doctors from America, England,
                    Australia, New Zealand, Scandinavia and many other countries. It's a very big
                    hospital and still a training hospital for women doctors. Ida B. became a close
                    friend of ours; she often stayed with us in Madras. She was invited down every
                    year to the university to help with medical examinations, and she always stayed
                    with us while she was there in Madras for three or four days. Our first call on
                    her after our arrival in South India was in Vellore. Later, we stayed with her
                    on several occasions in Kodaikanal where a house had been built for “Aunt Ida”.
                    It had been built by the Dodge family who had been great friends of the
                    Scudders. It was a lovely house called “Hilltop”, and several times we stayed
                    with Dr. Ida B. in that lovely house in Kodaikanal. It was at the highest
                    altitude in Kodai. Kodai is about 7500 feet and “Hilltop” was just slightly
                    higher. I remember from the garden one could overlook the plains of Madurai
                    which were at least fifty miles away, a very beautiful setting. The Scudders
                    were, and are, wonderful people. The services which they have rendered to the
                    people in the Middle East and in India are just outstanding.</p>
                <p>From this recording I think it's evident that our churches and church related
                    activities throughout our Foreign Service career really enriched our lives.</p>
