                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 5, 1999</p>

                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Ambassador Smith]</p>
                <p>Q: Today is March 5, 1999, and this is an interview with R. Grant Smith, and this
                    is to be done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training,
                    and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Grant, let's start kind of at the beginning. Can
                    you tell me when and where you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I was born on Long Island in 1938. My father was then a professor out
                    there, but he later came to Washington during the war, to the War Production
                    Board, and then joined the State Department and was Wristonized in 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wristonized meaning he was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He became an FSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a Foreign Service officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He went from Civil Service to FSO in 1956, and then he backed up a bit. He
                    had already served as a reserve officer in Bangkok and in Karachi, and in 1956
                    he became a regular Foreign Service officer and subsequently went off to Sri
                    Lanka and New Delhi. I did not accompany him to Sri Lanka and New Delhi, but I
                    did in Bangkok and Karachi. I actually went to school in India, and then I did
                    visit him in Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's move back a bit. In 1938, your father was a
                        professor where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Hofstra.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SMITH: Political science. No, I'm wrong. His father's field wapolitical science.
                    He was an economist. He was an economic officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family came from a professorial background, was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, those two generations. Before that there had been a businessman, and
                    there had been a mix before that. My grandmother's family was from upstate New
                    York. My mother's family was from banking in the Long Island area.</p>
                <p>Q: Growing up as a young lad, World War II was sort of over by the time you were
                    becoming more or less aware of the world. Was that it, would you say?</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to grammar school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Actually, I went to grammar school in the District oColumbia, various
                    places, but I went to fourth, fifth, and sixth grade in the District of
                    Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: High school I was part of the time in India and came back anfinished at
                    BCC -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Well, what about
                        whilyou going into elementary, grammar school, what were your
                        interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I guess my interests were more mechanical - science anengineering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did that continue through high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of science or mechanical engineering were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Most everything - mathematics, science, engineering.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you into taking automobiles apart, building model
                        airplanes,that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, given the places I was - you don't take automobiles apart in
                    northern India. So I did finish a basement on a house, completely, so there was
                    more carpentry and electrical, photography.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the first two years of high school you went to, or the
                        firsthree, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I went half a year at BCC and then went off to India. There's an American
                    missionary school in north India, Woodstock, and I was there, then, for two
                    years and came back and finished at BCC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Woodstock like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's up in the hills, so it's at 6,000 feet. It closes in the winter
                    because it's too cold, lots of snow. It's a missionary school, more so then than
                    it is now, and fairly strict, but a fascinating place, and in my class we had
                    about 20 percent Indian students, so I got to know some Indian students very
                    well, with whom I've maintained contact over the years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be sort of when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was there in 1953 and 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems that you felt as a young boy
                        betweeIndians and Americans there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there were the problems, I guess you'd call them, of post-colonial
                    society that the Indians were clamping down difficult restrictions on a whole
                    variety of things, but there were also the problems that at that time were just
                    beginning. Our relationship with Pakistan, our differences of perception over
                    the Kashmir issue. I can remember arguing with my roommate, who was an Indian,
                    about Kashmir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your teachers missionaries mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Mostly, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q: Were you getting a sort of a straight-line missionary type education, or were
                    you getting “whither India?” and concentrating on Indian affairs?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Woodstock is accredited in the United States, so it has very much an
                    American curriculum and always has and still has, so we got a fairly standard
                    American curriculum. What we got about India was culturally being there plus
                    there was a course in Indian history which I took. I did not take a course in
                    the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would there have been a language you could have taken a
                        course i- Hindi or Urdu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They gave a course in Hindi. But the course in Hindi which they gave was
                    really meant for their Indian students so they could be sure of passing the exam
                    in Hindi, which they needed to do for their own advancement. Therefore, the
                    people who were in it were not beginners, and it was being taught as what we
                    would call shud Hindi, which is very proper, correct, newspaper-newscast type of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up American-Indian relations at home when
                        yocame home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Going home meant going to Karachi, which meant taking the train down from
                    the hills and then flying from Delhi to Karachi. Yes, my father was economic
                    counselor in Karachi at the time, and I heard more about U.S.-Pakistan relations
                    and stories about that than I did about India, but just making that trip, one
                    got a fair idea of the problems and the refugees on both sides. My roommate was
                    from a refugee family, so one heard, certainly, about he India-Pakistan
                    relationship and some of the things about the U.S. role, although less about
                    U.S.-Indian relations, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is quite soon after the partition in '48.
                        We'rtalking about '53-54.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We still had war surplus peanut butter available in thbazaars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the British? Were you getting any feel for who
                        peoplreally looked upon the British at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SMITH: Some. The relationship has always been very complicated, I think, between
                    the Indians and the British. Of course, the Indian students in our class were
                    not studying for an Indian examination. They were studying for a Cambridge exam,
                    and therefore they were into the British system that way. This was in the very
                    early period. We did meet with Nehru. Our senior class met with Nehru. We made a
                    trip to Delhi and met with Nehru. I can remember he was quite prickly that
                    evening. Somebody asked him a question - I may have been one who asked him a
                    question - somebody asked him a question on a political and international
                    affairs subject, and he sort of brushed it aside. He was prickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went back to Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School -
                        thiwould have been '55-56, thereabouts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this was a different world? I mean, was it a
                        littlhard to adjust?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a difficult adjustment. The number students who had been overseas
                    was fairly small at that time. The faculty, although they gave me credit for the
                    time at Woodstock, I can remember that they didn't want to give credit for the
                    course in Indian history. They said, “Well, that's sort of like taking a course
                    in the history of the state of Maryland. You don't get credit for that.” But
                    since I actually had been ahead of myself in school, so that I'd taken a lot of
                    the required courses already, so the last year at BCC I was able to take courses
                    which I wouldn't have been able to take otherwise, including a course in
                    journalism, advanced physics, advanced chemistry - which meant that I wasn't
                    doing the same thing that everybody else was, and I think the course in
                    journalism, for instance, really made the difference as far as I was
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you on the paper and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I ran the school paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at '55-56, McCarthyism was a pretty big
                        thing. Wathat sort of a subject at the time you were there in school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember it being a subject at school; I remember it being a
                    subject I heard about at home. Because with a parent who'd worked in the federal
                    government during World War II, who knew some of the players, a father who was
                    then in the State Department, I heard a fair amount about it, concern about
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Q: Well, tell me now, with this sort of emphasis on sciences and mechanics and
                    also a strong background in Indian history, where did you want to go to
                    school?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as I recall, I wanted to go to someplace where I could do both, and
                    therefore I looked at universities and colleges where I could do science but
                    also either at the same time or, as it ultimately proved I changed my mind, do
                    international affairs or history, political science, economics courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did you finally point yourself towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I went to Princeton. I entered as an engineer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what happened at Princeton? You were at Princeton
                        what,from '56 to '60?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I graduated in the class of '60, yes. And as an engineer, the initial
                    courses are very set. The first year I was taking all of the initial courses,
                    and I don't even remember what my elective was. I think I had one other course.
                    And the second year also, but since I had already met a language requirement, I
                    think it was the second year I took economics, and by the end of the second year
                    I'd decided that I didn't want to be an engineer. I was interested in political
                    science and international affairs. I was also interested in science, so by the
                    end of the second year I'd gotten admitted to the Woodrow Wilson School but also
                    was taking enough science courses so that I could still change my mind if I
                    wanted to - but not engineering but physics at that point. I continued taking
                    physics courses junior year and finally gave up by senior year. But in the
                    Woodrow Wilson School I think I did more economics and history than anything
                    else, partly because I felt those were the stronger departments - some political
                    science, but more economics and history.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you've grown up with a father in the Foreign Service by this time. Were
                    you thinking at all of the Foreign Service, or was this on your radar?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I certainly was by senior year because I took the exam. And in the
                    summer of 1959, I was in Colombo with my parents. I did some research work
                    there. I had a small grant from the university and did some research on
                    technical assistance programs in then Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. So by senior year I
                    was thinking of the Foreign Service, although I interviewed and continued to
                    think about other things. There was a possibility of working for a company
                    active in international affairs, like, I think it was, ESSO Standard Eastern.
                    Stanvac was just breaking up, and ESSO Standard Eastern was being formed.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I think they were fairly neutral about all of this.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I passed the written, did not pass the oral.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you recall what the oral that you didn't pass was like? Do you remember
                    any of the questions?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember who was there. I do remember that I wasn't prepared
                    enough for the motivational questions for it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why you want to be in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, that type of thing. They were really looking foanswers like “to do
                    good for the world” and things like that.</p>
                <p>Q: I think this is always a difficult one in any case to apply, because you don't
                    want to overdo it. “It sounds like an interesting life and they pay me for it,
                    what the hell,” isn't a very satisfactory answer.</p>
                <p>SMITH: They didn't like that answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, having taken it and not passed the oral exam, did

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I went on to Columbia School of International Affairs for 1960-1962,
                    took the exam again in the fall of 1961 and passed the written, passed the oral
                    this time. This time I can remember that the chairman of my panel was Homer
                    Byington, III. You may have served with him at some point.</p>
                <p>Q: No, I didn't, but his name was hanging around because I was consul general in
                    Naples, where he, his father, and his grandfather all had been consuls
                    general.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SMITH: And I remember that one of the questions in the oral happened to be about
                    food assistance to India, PL-480 to India, and because of my background in India
                    and my interest in economics, was something that I understood fairly well and
                    understood that it was the equivalent of budgetary subvention, very helpful to
                    the Indian government. So in 1962 I did pass the Foreign Service Exam and spent
                    six months in the Marine Corps and entered at the beginning of '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Columbia first. Why Columbia, and what
                        were yodoing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I looked at three graduate schools. I'm not quite sure why I chose
                    Columbia over Tufts, where the Fletcher School is. But it was nice to be in New
                    York City. I found that in some ways it was not as academically stimulating as
                    the preceptorial system at Princeton. On the other hand, some of the course
                    there - there was the School of International Affairs... At least, I had a
                    specialty in South Asia. That was before they had the Southern Asian Institute,
                    but there were some people there who were very good in south Asia. So some of
                    the courses were exceptionally useful. There was one on the United Nations,
                    there was one on international law, which were very dry courses but proved very
                    valuable later on. Two or three courses in south Asia, one a very good one on
                    Indian history [with] Embry, another one on politics of South Asia with
                    [Wilcox].</p>
                <p>Q: Were you finding yourself attracted to south Asia, the subcontinent, or was
                    this because you had some experience you might as well fill in with in that
                    area?</p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I was definitely attracted to it, more so than other places.
                    Linguistically, I'd studied French. I could certainly read it easily enough; I
                    wasn't that good at speaking it. But I wasn't particularly attracted to Europe
                    or to Africa at that point.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, of course, this was the period, '60-62, sort of the discovery of Africa
                    by the United States. We were opening posts, and Africa was quite exciting
                    because of the decolonization there. Did this catch you at all, or what about
                    our colleagues? Was there a movement towards learning more about Africa
                    there?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember that there was at that point. I know there was an East
                    Asian Institute; I know there was a Russian and/or Eastern European Institute, a
                    Latin American Institute. I don't remember whether there was an African
                    Institute there. I remember it more as an issue that we would discuss in courses
                    on the UN or international politics - peacekeeping in Africa, things like this.
                    The Congo was particularly on top of everybody's plate.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, 1960 was the Nixon-Kennedy campaign, and it was for many a time when
                    people of your generation were particularly caught up by sort of the spirit of
                    Kennedy and working for the government. Did this touch you, or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think I'd already been caught up by it. It didn't change my
                    approach that much, and I remember a lot of enthusiasm among one or two of my
                    roommates, but I don't remember that translating into going into government. But
                    to back up a bit, if you go back to college and graduate school at that time,
                    people even before Kennedy, were already looking at going into government, and
                    the percentage of people from Princeton entering the Foreign Service was
                    significant. I think there were eight or nine classmates who came into the
                    Foreign Service. These days it's very, very small, much smaller than that.</p>
                <p>Q: I was not a veteran, but I went to college '46-50, and 75 percent of my class
                    were veterans, but also our teachers, many of them, of course, had military
                    service or had worked in the government, so that going into the government was a
                    very natural step. The fact that a significant number of my classmates went into
                    the CIA...</p>
                <p>SMITH: And professors at college tended to be people like that,who'd had some
                    background of this kind.</p>
                <p>Q: And there was, subtle or not so subtle, a recruitment. I mean, these were
                    people who had come out of this, and it's interesting, and going down to their
                    students and sort of pointing the way, which I don't think happens much any
                    more.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it happened more at the undergraduate than at the graduate level.
                    I should say, at the graduate level, I was a participant in the first year of
                    the International Fellows Program at Columbia, and that had people there who
                    became very much involved - Dick Gardner, who there during the year, came down
                    to Washington to be assistant secretary for international organization
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And as part of that program, we came down to Washington and met with a
                    number of people through the connections of the head of the program, Bobby
                    Kennedy included. So it was certainly part of that program. It was not part of
                    the general academic program at Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you came into the Foreign Service in early
                        '63, ithat right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you took the A-100 course, the basic officer
                        course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you characterize the people who were in that at the
                        time, odescribe the people who were in it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We were a very small class, about 13, with varied backgrounds. I can't say
                    that I've kept track of all of them. I kept track of a few of them. Some of them
                    have left the Foreign Service, didn't serve a full career there. It was a very
                    stimulating group. We had a lot of fun together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you trying to get back to the Subcontinent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I did ask for Karachi for my first assignment, and I did get Karachi. I
                    don't know whether there was any competition. I suspect that there wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect that's true. So you went out to Karachi - in
                        '63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH. Q: In '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from '63 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '64, just a short time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, in the middle of my tour I went to the embassy one Saturday morning
                    and there was a telegram for me which basically said, “Go directly to Kathmandu;
                    do not pass GO.” Because the consular officer position in Kathmandu had come
                    open because Desaix Anderson had been pulled out for someplace else, whether it
                    was Vietnam or Japan I don't remember, and they needed a consular officer
                    urgently. So I went to Kathmandu, and I'd got married just before we went to
                    Karachi, so my wife and I drove most of the way to Kathmandu. We had a
                    Volkswagen beetle, and the regulations at that time were that they wouldn't ship
                    that car, so I said, okay, I'll drive it. And they way I read the regulations -
                    and I later persuaded the State Department was the correct way to read them -
                    was that if I drove they had to pay me mileage. Whether they could ship it or
                    not, they still had to pay me mileage if I drove it, so we had a fascinating
                    trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to Karachi. You were in Karachi from
                        '63 t'64. In '63 it was the embassy at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Karachi was the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And could you describe the embassy - who was the
                        ambassador, anoperations there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, Walter McConaughy was the ambassador. Bill Cargo was the DCM. Dick
                    Greider was the economic counselor. Sneider was the political counselor. It was
                    large, and I was a rotational officer, served in the Economic Section, the
                    Political Section, briefly in the Consular Section, but mostly in the Economic
                    and Political Sections - the first year I was there I started out in the
                    Economic Section - and working on small things, at that time, but it was an
                    interesting time to be there, very much a continuation of that earlier period
                    that I mentioned. You could see a lot of changes in Karachi compared to when I'd
                    been there 10 years earlier. But the Pakistanis were developing their
                    relationship with the Chinese then. As I recall, Zhou En-Lai came to visit while
                    we were there. There was, of course, a very large aid program and military
                    assistance program, and although we didn't know much about it at the time, we
                    knew that there was something up in Peshawar, which was our base and listening
                    post.</p>
                <p>Q: The U-2 and all that sort of thing. Well, did you feel at all the hand of
                    Walter McConaughy, or not. I mean, was his presence noticeable at your
                    level?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Much more the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM being -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: - Bill Cargo, who'd come out about the same time. In fact, his wife and my
                    wife had been in the initial wives' course at the same time then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often there's been this tension between our embassy in
                        Pakistaand our embassy in India. Was this apparent at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very definitely so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a little about this?</hi>

                <p>SMITH: I just remember, in the sense of being conscious of the cables from New
                    Delhi being very much from the Indian point of view. That was by then... Bowles
                    was there on his second time in New Delhi, and Lane Timmons was the DCM, I
                    think, and it was a fairly shrill time. I don't remember following that closely
                    what was going on with India, because that was the post-China war situation.</p>
                <p>

                <p>SMITH: '62, and I don't remember being that aware of it. One of the complications
                    was that I'd actually been at Parris Island during the '62 war, so I didn't know
                    very much about the '62 war except what I'd gone back and found out about.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Yes. Much more conscious of the things that were going on between the U.S.
                    and India and Pakistan and our attempts to mediate the Kashmir dispute, although
                    I've forgotten the details of it. It's the kind of thing I go back and read
                    about now in books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Pakistanis with whom you
                        were dealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think that we had always been impressed by the professionalism of the
                    Pakistani bureaucrat, and we knew some of the military officers, since my wife
                    is a rider, and that's the way you get to know the military. Very professionals,
                    very good with Americans, and comparatively open. I don't remember having the
                    feeling that they were very closed. They certainly gave the impression of being
                    open. You could travel around, and they would say, “Well, you shouldn't go up
                    there because there are tribesmen up there,” but you could travel other
                    places.</p>
                <p>Q: I've never served in either of the two countries, but the Pakistanis,
                    certainly in the earlier times, seem to have impressed the Americans more than
                    the Indians. The Indians always seem disputatious and argue, and usually come at
                    the United States lecturing us on where we've gone wrong, and of course
                    Americans prefer to lecture other people on the morality of something. And it
                    doesn't seem to work very well. Did you have the feeling that the Pakistanis
                    seem kind of like us, or something like that? Was that at all noticeable?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, this was a period, remember, of basically military rule.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. And it was also a period, I think, if you'll go back in the
                    intellectual history, you'll see that we were thinking of the military in some
                    developing countries serving as a modernizing influence, and Pakistan was often
                    cited as an example of a place where the military would be nationalizing and
                    modernizing influence - which was something that one could relate to in Pakistan
                    at that time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course it was a factor in our relations with Pakistan. The
                    Pakistanis have always been much more focused on India than they have been on
                    Kashmir. On some occasions they're focused a little bit on Afghanistan, but not
                    so much on the Soviets.</p>

                    after I got in the Foreign Service we got married and went off to Karachi. We
                    took a ship from New York to Naples, in the days you still could do that, and
                    that was sort of our honeymoon.</p>

                    that hit Pakistan? Was there any attention paid to that?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I was very impressed by the reaction of everybody. I think we were out at
                    the Yacht Club when the news came, and the Yacht Club just shut down for the
                    day. The Yacht Club was certainly a relic of the British Raj and still had a
                    significant number of expatriate members, but it was Pakistan Navy also. No,
                    there was a tremendous outpouring at all levels in Pakistan, from Pakistanis as
                    well as from the expatriate community.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SMITH: I've often thought that if I was going to write anything in the way of a
                    memoir, I would write about trips I'd taken, and this would be the first,
                    because we didn't drive from Karachi to Lahore. We'd already driven from Karachi
                    to Lahore before, and we knew that we didn't want to drive that again, but we
                    put the car on the train up to Lahore and then drove. So we drove from Lahore
                    across the border between India and Pakistan, which is always an experience,
                    going across the land border there, and then on to New Delhi. I don't remember
                    whether we spent the night in Amritsar or not - yes, we spent the night in
                    Amritsar and went to the Golden Temple, then drove on to New Delhi. We had a dog
                    with us. We had to find a hotel that would have the dog. We spent a day or so in
                    New Delhi. My wife, of course, had never been to India before, and then we
                    looked at the map and we saw that the direct road, the old Grand Trunk Road,
                    didn't have a national highway number on it. The national highway went south
                    through Agra and sort of looped around and came back into the old Grand Trunk
                    Road. Well, we thought that that's a national highway; it's a good way to get to
                    Agra and see the Taj Mahal, which I'd seem but my wife hadn't. So we went to
                    Agra to see the Taj Mahal, and the next day, after 10 or 20 miles out of Agra,
                    we encountered a flood. There had been heavy rains that year, the Jumna had
                    flooded, and we had to make a decision whether we were going to try and find out
                    whether Volkswagen beetles could float - because we could see camels wading
                    through it - it was up to their knees - or we were going to turn around. And we
                    chickened out and turned around, and we had to go all the way back to New Delhi,
                    spend another night in Delhi, crossed the Jumna in New Delhi, and drive a very
                    long day's drive, I think it was, to Khanpur and spent the night there in a
                    terrible hotel, drove another night to Patna, another terrible hotel - no
                    sightseeing along the way. And from Patna, to go north to Nepal, first you had
                    to cross the Ganges, and there was not bridge at Patna then. To find a bridge it
                    would have meant a detour of a couple of hundred miles, so we put the car on a
                    ferry, which was an experience. It took a long time, as we watched the bodies
                    come floating down the Ganges, but we got across, we got to the other side. We
                    were approaching the Nepal border late in the day, and the terrain was beginning
                    to change; the language was beginning to change. This whole time I'd been able
                    to speak Hindi. I'd studied Hindi-Urdu. I'd been able to speak during the whole
                    trip, and suddenly as we got up close to the border, the... In India, you know,
                    they say that every 50 miles the language changes, and if you go far enough you
                    aren't going to be able to understand it. Well, by then I wasn't able to
                    understand it, and we had gotten cool, and we were steaming along, and a
                    beautiful new bridge up ahead of us we saw. We screeched to a stop because we
                    realized the whole approach had washed out. We had to go down a little tiny
                    trail, down to where they had a raft where they would ferry you across; and the
                    raft consisted of two country posts - like big canoes - lashed together with a
                    bamboo platform. But fortunately it was a Volkswagen Beetle, and we had no
                    trouble getting it on. At one point one wheel went in through the bamboo, I
                    guess, and the guys were helping us pick it up that time. And we got across, we
                    got to the Nepal border at just about dark or after dark. The Indian side was
                    difficult, lots of forms. Particularly when you're trying to arrive or leave
                    with a car you have lots of forms. We got across. We got to the Nepalese customs
                    post, and they said, “Oh, it's very late. Why don't you go spend the night and
                    come back, and we'll check you through in the morning,” wich is what we did.
                    There was a very nice state guest house there, and we came back the next morning
                    and did the customs paperwork and drove to Kathmandu and had the heater on by 11
                    o'clock in the morning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In Kathmandu, of course it was a very small embassy. Henry Stebbins was
                    the ambassador, and Harry Barnes was the DCM. I always consider that I was
                    fortunate to serve in a-</p>
                <p>Q: Two professionals... Later, anyway, this became often the plaything of some
                    wealthy contributor who liked to hike or climb mountains or shoot animals or
                    something.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Stebbins was the first ambassador and was there for I don't remember how
                    many years. I think it was four or five years. And Carol Laise was the second,
                    who was also there for a considerable period of time. But we had very a
                    professional ambassador, and a very hard-charging young DCM who spoke the
                    language, had studied Nepali with the Peace Corps, and was a real example to
                    everybody on the linguistic side, and was determined that people not spend too
                    much time in Kathmandu. He insisted that everybody go out and trek. At one
                    point, I was sent off on a trek with our admin officer, who although he was a
                    hunter, he hadn't been off on any treks in the hills. We went off to eastern
                    Nepal and trekked there for a ways, did some political work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I was doing consular work and economic work, so I saw much more of
                    the economic side, and I certainly became very knowledgeable about the problems
                    of small countries which are economically linked to larger ones, as Nepal is to
                    India, and the complexities of trade, exchange rate, and development in that
                    case. They were just beginning to think about developing Nepal's hydroelectric
                    potential at that time. Nepal has enormous hydroelectric potential. I remember
                    some years later an Indian telling me that one project alone was larger than the
                    entire installed electric generating capacity in north India. That project still
                    hasn't been built, largely for political reasons.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SMITH: They knew about the United States. The level of education and knowledge
                    was much less than of course in India, where you had and have that very
                    well-educated international - then Anglicized - group. That group was much
                    smaller in Nepal, a very, very thin veneer, so if you got below that level, you
                    really did need Nepali, and you wouldn't have anybody who knew much about the
                    United States. We did have a substantial Peace Corps contingent there, and for
                    the size of the country it was then one of the larger ones, I believe - 40, 50,
                    60 Peace Corps volunteers spread around the country really had an impact, and
                    several of them subsequently joined the Foreign Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was the consular officer. There was very little to do in the way of
                    visas. There were some American citizen services problems, but it was before the
                    influx of tourists because at that time only DC-3s flew in, and you just can't
                    get that many tourists in a DC-3. So we had few tourists, but I didn't have any
                    large numbers. It was before the hippies. I didn't have any large numbers, and
                    as it turned out when I was there, there were no mountaineering accidents or
                    major catastrophes like that.</p>
                <p>Q: Because also there was always the mountaineering, but it also became a sort of

                <p>SMITH: Yes, there were contacts. I can't remember feeling that we developed
                    personal relations with too many, although with some. Some people in the Foreign
                    Ministry I can remember developing relations with, some younger people in town,
                    whom I later saw in other capacities.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SMITH: The AID mission in Kathmandu was very large. It actually institutionally
                    was [more like an] the embassy. The embassy came in after the AID program and in
                    many ways we were piggybacking on their infrastructure. They were very involved
                    [on] a lot of different levels, doing a lot of agricultural development, rural
                    development, things like that. I don't remember at the time having strong
                    impressions of impact of those programs - with the exception of some of the work
                    that was done on road building, which was obviously very visible and important
                    in tying the country together. And that became more after I left, in fact. But I
                    don't remember having impressions of the impact of the developmental
                    activities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very definitely, and much more so than you would say that the Soviet
                    menace was felt in Pakistan, the Chinese presence was felt in Nepal. They
                    started building the highway from Kathmandu to Tibet while we were there, and
                    with large numbers of Chinese workers. We saw the examples of the kind of aid
                    which China gives, building things - a brick factory, as I recall, a leather
                    factory. I don't remember whether they built a stadium or not. Q: What about
                    Tibetan refugees or events in Tibet? Was that sort of spilling over into where
                    you were?</p>
                <p>SMITH: The big influx from Tibet had occurred earlier. There certainly were
                    Tibetan refugees, and there were Tibetans. There were Tibetan refugee camps, and
                    there were Tibetan articles available in Nepal. I didn't personally have a
                    strong sense of what was going on in Tibet that I didn't already have from my
                    acquaintance with India. But going back to your earlier question about the
                    Chinese, of course that was a period when we, the United States, were very
                    concerned about Chinese influence, which led, while I was there, to the “deal”
                    with India, that we would provide India some assistance - as I recall, some
                    equipment - so that they could help build a portion of the east-west highway and
                    preempt the Chinese down in Tarai from building roads down in the southern part
                    of Nepal, which is plains and geographically much more connected with India. So
                    there's a sense of cooperation with India vis-�-vis the Chinese and Nepal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the presence of the Indians? Were they pretty

                <p>SMITH: They were very influential. This was another post-colonial society,
                    although the colonists in this case were more like the Indians. The British had
                    left at Independence, and what had been the British embassy because the Indian
                    embassy, and just as if you had read recently about how in Tibet the only way
                    you could send a letter was to send it to the British embassy. In Nepal, when we
                    were there, the best way to send a letter was through the Indian post office at
                    the Indian embassy. The Indians had been very involved, were very involved in
                    Nepal, had been very involved in the restoration of the monarchy there. The
                    Indian embassy - I think it was then a third or second secretary who actually
                    sat in the Nepalese cabinet meetings when the monarchy was restored, to give you
                    an idea of Indian influence - that individual was then director for Nepal in the
                    Indian Foreign Ministry back in New Delhi.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the impression you were getting from the ambassador, DCM, about the
                    king and the royal family and the government at the top level?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Supportive. I'm not sure of the exact sequence of events, but of course
                    the current king, who was then the crown prince, went to Harvard for a period.
                    We certainly had a hand in arranging that. So there was an interest in
                    modernizing the monarchy. At the same time we had relations with the democratic
                    elements, the Nepal Congress elements, relations of whom were there in Kathmandu
                    and others were outside of Nepal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was quite a small international community, but there were some
                    younger Nepalese who participated in the social life of that international
                    community, who were students or airline pilots or filmmakers - I remember those
                    three in particular.</p>

                <p>SMITH: With them, yes, but as I say, I never established the kind of relations...
                    I established them to some extent, but not to the extent that I later did in
                    other places with younger Foreign Service officers or government officials and
                    academics that I was later able to. It was a little bit harder in Nepal.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Not much at that time. Some. I think we were certainly aware of it. I
                    don't remember diplomatically exactly what we were doing about it. Of course,
                    the embassy there later became much more involved with the shuttle flights,
                    Bunker-Laise.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I came back to Washington to work in the Office of UPolitical Affairs.</p>

                <p>SMITH: That was back in the days of the old officer-in-charge system. This was
                    the Office of UN Political Affairs, and they had an officer in charge of the
                    Middle East within that, issues in the Middle East, and I was his assistant.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Elizabeth Ann Brown.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it was the major issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean Middle Eastern affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was mostly the Arab-Israel issue. At that time, it's hard to remember
                    before the '67 War, but the Arab-Israel issue in the UN context came up
                    primarily in the debate on UNRRA [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
                    Administration], on aid to Palestine refugees. That was the vehicle for the
                    whole debate. There was no separate issue the way it is now. So we were very
                    involved, not only in what was going on there, the operations of the UN Truce
                    Supervision Organization, which was the peacekeeping organization which was
                    observing the armistice between Egypt and Israel, Egypt and Jordan, Lebanon, and
                    Syria, but also the refugee affairs part of it.</p>
                <p>Q: I imagine everything divides between pre-June of '67 and... How did we view
                    the Palestinian refugee situation? Were we looking for a plan to do something
                    about them, or we just willing to let this kind of fester?</p>
                <p>SMITH: My recollection is then that, yes, there were a lot of plans to try and
                    resolve this problem, unwilling to let it fester permanently, as it has since.
                    Although there were a lot of refugee camps, you hadn't had the '67 or '73 wars,
                    so you were still working on the basis of the original Arab-Israel conflicts,
                    the original armistice, the refugee flights - everybody harked back to those
                    events. And there were lots of plans around for resolution in some way of these
                    problems, many of them being done by people concerned about the refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, during the first half, was there much
                        interest othe part of the politicals in the United States about the
                        refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, but I don't think to the extent that they later got anybody's
                    attention, and... I was thinking back whether there were major efforts during
                    this period to resolve the problem, as there were later, and I'm not sure that I
                    remember any. I may be wrong.</p>
                <p>Q: Those of you who were dealing with this, was there a feeling that we were kind
                    of alone in being concerned about this, or were other countries concerned about
                    the Palestinian refugees?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Other countries were concerned. We certainly had a leadership role because
                    of our particular relationship with Israel, and we were seen that way. As I
                    recall, the head of UNRRA was an American in that period, and we had the deputy,
                    and we had another person in an important post back then.</p>

                <p>SMITH: No, I wasn't.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, I became more aware of it later - let's put it that way. I'm not
                    sure that the issues were out there at that time, as they later were.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, it was just how much money, what we can do to support this and all that.
                    I take it that there wasn't much of a feeling of support for helping the
                    refugees in the other Arab countries as far as trying to resettle them at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don not recall that as being our policy. We were stilgiving very
                    substantial amounts to UNRRA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather that for most of the Arab world -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: - the idea of resettlement would have been an anathema.</p>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: I mean, it was something... “The festering will continue.” This was the
                    general... I think, too, that the Palestinians weren't that well regarded
                    throughout the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, they were recognized for their intellectual abilities and the Saudi
                    representative in New York at the time was actually a Palestinian.</p>
                <p>Q: You had Palestinians running things in a lot of the Arab world, but again, it
                    was a little bit almost the mirror image of anti-Semitism in Europe: these were
                    essentially a more capable group of Arabs, which does not necessarily generate
                    love.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. The Security Council at the time, as I recall, was caught up in
                    issues, cross-border incidents - this was, again, before '67 - a continuous
                    stream of cross-border incidents, not with Lebanon, but with the other three
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was no real organized Palestinian
                        LiberatioOrganization. These were more sort of at the local level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: As I recall, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, then, let's talk about the June, '67, war, which was precipitated by
                    Nasser and what he did. Could you talk about how this developed, as far as we
                    were seeing it? I imagine you got caught up in this, didn't you?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, it was something of a Greek tragedy, as Nasser demanded the
                    withdrawal of UNEF, and the natural result of that... Well, the question of the
                    withdrawal of UNEF and there was the question of blocking the Straits of Tiran,
                    as I recall. And these two were naturally driving things towards conflict. At
                    the same time, it was... Well, the U.S. felt that UNEF should not be withdrawn.
                    On the other hand, UNEF had been put in in a way that if the troop-contributing
                    countries reacted to Egypt by withdrawing their troops, there was very little
                    that the UN could do about it. As I recall it was only on the Egyptian side of
                    the border. It was there with the approval of the Egyptian government, so it was
                    very hard for the UN - given the way UNEF had come about - to keep UNEF there if
                    Nasser insisted on withdrawing it. And therefore you could see where this was
                    going. At the same time, I think that we were surprised by the Israeli attack
                    and confused ourselves. At least, at my level I was. The higher-ups may have
                    been clearer-sighted about exactly what had happened in those first hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, where were you when the whole thing started, the

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SMITH: I was in Washington - as I recall, having just gotten out of the Marine
                    Corps reserves, so I didn't have to go off to summer camp that year, and the
                    Office of UN Political Affairs staffed the task force in the Operations Center
                    together with the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and split the responsibility to
                    a certain extent. The Op Center was a much smaller place in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we basically bystanders while this war was
                        fought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We certainly were not basically bystanders. In the Office of UN Political
                    Affairs we were trying desperately to get it stopped, although in hindsight -
                    and I'm not sure whether I thought about it at the time - when you look at maps
                    there are logical stopping places, and the logical stopping places were the Suez
                    and the Jordan, but the problem was that in Syria there was no logical stopping
                    place. I was on duty, I think, the night as the Israelis were pushing towards
                    Damascus, and it was not clear if and where they would stop, because there was
                    no logical stopping place. We didn't know about the phone calls that were going
                    on at that time between the White House and Moscow - at least I didn't - but
                    certainly tensions were rising considerably.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling within the bureau that you were picking up from people
                    who were dealing with it? It was U Thant, wasn't it, who was the Secretary
                    General, and there were those... At least I remember at the time criticism that
                    when Nasser said pull out the United Nations forces, he sort of saluted and did
                    it right away rather than stall and try to make it apparent to all that this was
                    not a good idea.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think he didn't do it quite that quickly. Those of us in the
                    bureau who followed the UN felt that, given the way UNEF had been created, he
                    really didn't have much choice. He could have tried to delay a little bit more,
                    but it wouldn't have made any difference when the national contingents began
                    withdrawing, when the Indians began withdrawing. I think the Yugoslavs were
                    withdrawing also. He didn't have much choice. And I guess we understood the
                    political pressure on him to be harder-lined, but didn't see how he really could
                    be.</p>
                <p>Q: When the war started, what was the feeling? It was a six-day war - say on Day
                    One, was there a feeling that the Egyptians and the Syrians and all and the
                    Jordanians are in for a very bloody nose?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Remember, it only began with the Egyptians. The Jordanians joined later. I
                    don't remember exactly when the Syrians joined, but the first run was with the
                    Egyptians, and I think everybody recognized the Egyptians were going to have a
                    very difficult time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. Well, as the war started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A surprise attack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Everybody, I think, felt that Jordan did the wrong thing, the wrong thing
                    for the country, perhaps the right thing for the survival of the monarchy,
                    because I don't remember at the time the details, but I do remember that there
                    was some question whether the r�gime would have survived not participating. But
                    certainly as far as Jordan was concerned, it was a bad decision, because they
                    lost the Left Bank and gave the Israelis an excuse to take territory that they
                    had long wanted, particularly East Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>Q: By the time this was moving on and the Israeli armies were advancing, was
                    there concern within the Department about the Soviets? Was this being done on a
                    level that didn't really penetrate?</p>
                <p>SMITH: The time when there was concern was when they were moving against the
                    Syrians. As I recall, the sequence was they took care of the Egyptians and then
                    went after the Syrians, and so in the case of the Egyptians, there was a logical
                    stopping place. They may have even sent a message to that effect, but it was
                    pretty clear. Would they go for Cairo? But in the case of going up the Golan,
                    there wasn't a logical stopping point, and that's where there was concern about
                    the Soviets and their reaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this thing was over, after the six days, what were
                        you dointhen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, after the war itself, of course, any effort turned to some kind of
                    framework solution, and that was the negotiations about what became 242, which
                    went on... I don't remember the exact sequence, but 242 was adopted by the
                    Security Council in November, was it? It was many months after the war itself.
                    It took a long time, a tremendous amount of effort, to get that agreement in
                    place, and it was very difficult. The negotiations were very difficult with the
                    two sides and with the other permanent members.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you doing during this time?</p>
                <p>SMITH: The work that a junior officer would do in that kind of an office but, I
                    remember, very involved in minutiae about wording and references to exactly how
                    the resolution would be worded, exactly what word would be used, how you would
                    bring in the past, all of those details.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was very much a cooperative relationship. We jointly manned the task
                    force. The UNP, my boss or myself, went to their staff morning meetings - very
                    much a cooperative relationship there, and I think a very good relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, too, I think that during this period - I try to capture the atmosphere a
                    bit - what were the... Since '56 we had not been great admirers, at least at the
                    top levels, of Egypt's Nasser, and was there a certain amount of, oh, discreet
                    pleasure about his missteps that had caused this disaster for Egyptians?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember that sentiment specifically. I do remember that we did
                    have some very strong differences with the Egyptians, not only Nasser, writ
                    large, but also specifically the kinds of things they were doing in Yemen at
                    that time, because as I recall, one of the first uses of poison gas was by the
                    Egyptians in Yemen, and we had closed our embassy in Yemen, I think, even before
                    the Six-Day War. But we already had differences with them about Yemen. The
                    concern I remember the most out of this was for the Jordanians, that they had
                    been the biggest losers and, in a sense, the innocent bystanders who had really
                    gotten hurt the most in this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, we thought that the basis for the long-run solution was present in
                    that resolution, in 242. But there wasn't much focus yet on things like that. It
                    was very much on getting the overall framework, in my recollection. Well, and
                    getting some mechanisms in place to supervise the new lines.</p>
                <p>Q: Here all the attention of you and your colleagues is focused on this war. Was
                    there the feeling at this time that the United States was being overly
                    distracted by Vietnam?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember that sentiment.</p>
                <p>Q: I understand. You're down worrying about the nitty-gritty of the thing. I'm
                    just trying to capture any feeling. Well, then, in '68, what did you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SMITH: I had been assigned to the embassy in Tunis. In fact, I had been going to
                    early-morning language classes and gotten up to the 3/3 level in French, but
                    sometime in late '67, I think it probably was, we had the first GLOP, and as a
                    result of that, the junior political officer position in Tunis was abolished, so
                    I did not go to Tunis, and I was scrambling around as to what I was going to do.
                    This was the end of the year or the beginning of '68, and there wasn't much
                    there at that point. The only thing that was there was the post in Belize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: As actually the number two in Belize, which was then British Honduras. So
                    I took that, in I guess it was March of 1968, and we went off to Belize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Belize from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: '68 to '70. Q: I've read this book - what is it, Our Man in Belize?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I haven't read it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there's a book about when the hurricane hit. When

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: '61.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '61, so this is before. You have to check on that. It's

                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was still a British colony. There was a British garrison out near the
                    airport but not visibly present in the city. It was very much in the British
                    tradition, in the sense that policemen didn't carry guns. It was very peaceful.
                    The governor wore a hat that looked very colonial, with plumes and everything.
                    The economy was very open, as was usually the case in the colonies, but it was
                    de facto much more tied to the U.S. than to the UK. The Belizean dollar was
                    then, as it is now, I believe, pegged to the U.S. dollar. The major exports were
                    sugar, orange juice, some vegetables. As far as Belize was concerned, their
                    share of the sugar quota of the United States and whether there was a freeze in
                    Florida or not were major economic issues. It was poor but quite open and
                    democratic. There were regular elections. The government changed. I'm not sure
                    whether it changed while I was there, but the prime minister, who was prime
                    minister several times later, used to drive himself around in an old Land Rover.
                    Everybody knew him, driving around in an old Land Rover. The major issue was
                    Guatemala - the Guatemalan claim - and how that would be resolved. And we were
                    involved in negotiations. I must admit I don't remember the details of the
                    negotiations any more, but we had produced a proposal which had been rejected,
                    and the opposition was strongly against any deal with Guatemala. We'd often have
                    demonstrations, “We don't want no Guatemala.” Q: Did Guatemala claim a part of
                    Belize or all of it?</p>
                <p>SMITH: That was the problem. Guatemala claimed the entirety oBelize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a little difficult to negotiate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It's one of those cases where the very existence was threatened by the
                    claim, not a sliver but the whole country. And it dated back to the previous
                    century and the history of British colonization of that coast and the agreements
                    with Guatemala at the time. But in fact, the country had become very British. It
                    was slightly less than 50 percent of Indian or Hispanic origin people and
                    slightly less than 50 percent of blacks who'd come in from the West Indies, and
                    a small percentage of Chinese, Portuguese, English. But very balanced racially,
                    very mixed racially. And a fascinating place to be because, I used to say, it's
                    the only place where there is no difference between macroeconomics and
                    microeconomics, and you could almost look at the balance of payments or balance
                    of trade and track individual transactions because everything was so small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Bob Tepper was the consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your job - well, you were number two.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SMITH: I was number two, but I was the economic officer and icharge when Bob
                    Tepper wasn't there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did America have any interest other than just not wanting

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We certainly had an interest in the resolution of the dispute with
                    Guatemala, this being our back yard, and we had an interest in that being
                    resolved peacefully. We were not, however, in a position, I would say, that we
                    were strongly... We were supporting a resolution of the dispute; we were not
                    out-and-out supporting Belizean independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Guatemala? Did our consulate general have
                        mucrelation with our embassy in Guatemala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We used to go there periodically. In fact, we took the pouch by plane to
                    Guatemala and picked one up and brought it back, which gave us a reason to make
                    that trip regularly. Guatemala was a very different place. You could hear
                    machine gun fire at night. Our ambassador was later assassinated there, as I
                    recall. When we had visitors from Guatemala, we would take them down to a street
                    corner political rally to remind them what democracy was like. The few AID
                    programs that we had in Belize were being run out of the regional office in
                    Guatemala, which was another reason for our going there and people coming
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the British? Were the British committed to
                        thindependence of Belize?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were committed to the protection of Belize. They weren't committed to
                    pushing ahead with independence blindly. They very much wanted a negotiated
                    solution themselves, because if they pushed ahead blindly, then they had to
                    protect Belize, and they weren't sure that they wanted to protect Belize that
                    completely, although they did show an interest in the readiness of the airplanes
                    of the Guatemalan Air Force.</p>
                <p>Q: As far as Guatemala was concerned, it seems like Guatemala, more than the
                    other Central American governments or societies, is in a way more prone to
                    violence. It sounds like Belize is relatively quiet and the Guatemalans use
                    their revolvers and machetes.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SMITH: That was our impression at the time. Subsequently, things have changed a
                    bit, in the sense that there is some almost gang warfare in Belize City now. So
                    some of the violence that later came to affect U.S. cities affected Belize also,
                    but at that time, certainly, Belize was very peaceful. While we were there, we
                    had one robbery. Our trash cans were stolen. And it was some kids, we were
                    pretty sure, and we asked around and found out who they were and sort of left a
                    message at the home of one of them that if the trash cans weren't back by noon
                    we were going to report this to the police; and the trash cans were returned.
                    The place was extremely peaceful when we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the “Soccer War?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Soccer War happened while we were in Belize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was between Guatemala and Honduras.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right, and we had very little impact in Belize. Both sides were
                    concerned that somehow there might be something going on in Belize supporting
                    their opponent. I can remember in the middle of the war a DC-3 from the
                    Salvadoran Air Force arrived, and the Honduran consul went, “Ah,” to the
                    governor and said, “You must impound that plane. It might have been bombing.”
                    Although it was clearly a cargo plane. And the governor, I always felt, was sort
                    of uncertain about what to do, but he got his police chief and asked the police
                    chief to go see if the pilot would let them have a look in the plane. And that's
                    what the police chief did. By that time the plane had been on the ground for
                    several hours, so when the police chief looked at it, it had already been loaded
                    with a full load of Scotch Whiskey. So the Salvadoran Air Force, in the middle
                    of the Soccer War, was running whiskey. Ballantyne's, or Scotch, was then $18 a
                    case. You can see why they were coming to Belize to buy Scotch.</p>
                <p>Q: The Belize government had a prime minister and all. Did you find that except
                    for the defense element it was a pretty independent operation, or were the
                    British still pulling all the strings?</p>
                <p>SMITH: No, we found it quite independent. The area that the British had control
                    of, of course, was foreign affairs and the negotiation with Guatemala, where
                    they were the prime negotiator but were not going ahead without the agreement of
                    the Belizeans. There was a British advisor in the police department, as I
                    recall, who was from the intelligence side, but the level of British influence
                    was certainly not oppressive, and the prime minister was basically in charge of
                    things at home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was isolated. It was quiet. The consulate had a Boston Whaler. I'm not
                    sure whether it was justified on the basis of recreation or justified on the
                    basis of evacuation, officially to Washington, but it certainly served the
                    recreation purposes, because the U.S. government paid for the boat, and the
                    consulate staff could use it, go out. In a 45-minute run you'd be out on a
                    little spit of sand on the reef and some of the best skin-diving in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it still iLumber - was that a big industry
                        still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Lumber was the reason for the establishment of the British presence in
                    that part of the coast but it had become much less of an industry by the time we
                    were there. Again, sugar - there was a big British sugar mill - citrus, some
                    vegetables - they were beginning to grow vegetables for the U.S. market. There
                    was an expatriate community. There were three social clubs. The one which was
                    predominantly British, which was dead. There was a Latino one, which was quite
                    lively, and there was one whose backbone, I would say, was black civil servants,
                    which was also very interesting but in a different way. It tended to focus more
                    on cricket and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Caribbean weigh in? I'm thinking of
                        Jamaica,particularly, or what about Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Mexico was influential. There was a considerable smuggling trade from
                    Belize to Mexico. If you looked at their trade statistics, you could only
                    understand them if you knew that all of that champagne that was being imported
                    was in fact being smuggled out to Mexico, and other things like that. The
                    Mexicans had taken a position on the Guatemalan dispute that was interesting.
                    Mexico also claimed part of Belize. They didn't claim the whole country, and
                    their position was that if the Belizeans and Guatemalans resolved their claims,
                    the Mexicans would withdraw theirs, which was a position that certainly gave
                    them a lot of credit with the Belizeans.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, I would think. I mean, this gave them somebody behind them. How did you
                    all feel? Did you feel that this Guatemalan claim was something you really
                    wanted to do, or was this just sort of a local election ploy?</p>
                <p>SMITH: We felt that the Guatemalans had made a large issue out of it. They were
                    printing stamps, Belize was theirs. It was certainly an issue, or seem from our
                    side to be an issue in Guatemala. On the other hand, it was clear to us that the
                    Belizeans - certainly the Anglophone ones, but most of the non-Anglophone ones
                    as well - didn't want much to do with Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Guatemala was also not a very impressive place.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, from our personal standpoint that was something else. Here we had a
                    country that was really a democracy and that, by developing country standards,
                    an impressive democracy. And if you look at the statistics, you'll see that
                    elections in Belize are won by 15 votes and that the government has regularly
                    changed from one side to the other. It is a democratic place, and it goes down;
                    it isn't just an elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel there was much interest in what you
                        were doinin Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Not too much. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>I was talking about democracy in Belize and how it really was a democracy, and
                    you asked whether there was much interest in Washington. There was interest in
                    resolving the dispute, and that had engaged people in Washington, but I don't
                    think there was much interest beyond that. I remember some years later when
                    Belize did become independent, I happened to be working again in UN Political
                    Affairs and was working with our mission in New York on the statement that we
                    would make at the time Belize became independent and became a member of the
                    United Nations, and I had to keep reminding them how much history the United
                    States had with Belize. After the Civil War some people had fled to Belize and
                    established plantations there. We'd had the strong history of rum-running during
                    Prohibition, which wasn't something we were about to touch on. But Washington
                    didn't see Belize as a key country in Latin America by any means then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any disputed islands off Belize? Some of these
                        placein the Caribbean... any island problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Guatemalan claim, of course, meant that all of the Belizean islands
                    were disputed, and subsequently there has become a dispute with Guatemala over
                    where the border is, but at that time, there wasn't a dispute because it was all
                    or nothing as far as Guatemala was concerned. There was no dispute; there is a
                    history of relations between Belize and the Bay Islands of Honduras. I don't
                    think there's any claim there, but there are strong cultural ties.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it was during this time - maybe I'm wrong - that we inserted troops
                    into the Dominican Republic. Was it at this time, or was this a little
                    earlier?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I believe it was a little bit earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe it was earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SMITH: But the events of that kind had very little reverberation in Belize.
                    Things that would go on in the English-speaking Caribbean would have some effect
                    there, because you did have a community of Jamaicans or Trinidadians, but those
                    were fairly small. It was a very insular place, with one big issue, which was
                    Guatemala.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop at this point? We'll pick it up
                        nextime. In 1970, you left Belize. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I came back to Washington to work in the India Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is April 29, 1999. Grant, you came back in 1970 to work iwhat, the
                    India-</p>
                <p>SMITH: The India Desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: India Desk. And you did that from when to when? SMITH:
                        Until the summer of 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the India Desk consist of? I mean, was it
                        large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, then as now, it covers India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, as well as the
                    Maldives and Bhutan. Then we had a director, a deputy director, two political
                    officers (I was the junior of the two). The deputy director was also the senior
                    economic officer, and there was a junior economic officer, plus there was a Desk
                    officer for Sri Lanka and one for Nepal.</p>
                <p>Q: This was an interesting time, wasn't it, for being on India? Kissinger was in
                    the White House and was interested in the China via Pakistan connection, and
                    India seemed to be getting sort of short shrift. Did you feel that, or was this
                    a fair way of saying it, or how would you describe it?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the key event of the two years I was there was the December 1971
                    India-Pakistan War, and the key action that we took during that war that
                    affected our relations with India for many years thereafter - if not still - was
                    the dispatch of the carrier task force headed by the Enterprise to the Indian
                    Ocean during the war. And it was something that, when it happened, we on the
                    Desk didn't know about. We found out about it later. It was done by Kissinger,
                    and he always made clear in the little book he wrote when he commented on this,
                    that this had been done “in the context of the relationship with China.” In
                    other words, Pakistan was an ally of China, and because of our new opening to
                    China and the relationship that Pakistan had in establishing that opening, he
                    didn't think that we could stand by in the situation which could have occurred
                    towards the end of that conflict, which was that India succeeded in liberating
                    Bangladesh and would then turn to Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was later. It didn't start in '70, did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, the events which led up to it started in March of 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What area were you dealing with in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Particularly as we looked at political aspects of the cultural
                    relationship, scientific relationship, Peace Corps, and things like that, all of
                    which were... Well, it wasn't an easy a time for any of those. Certainly the AID
                    program was declining in size; the Peace Corps was declining in size; so there
                    were political elements to all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was sort of “Mr. India” in the State Department at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Dave Schneider was the country director, and I guess you could say he was
                    Mr. India. The deputy assistant secretary in the NEA front office was Chris Van
                    Hollen, who of course covered all of South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get it into the picture, who was India's
                        primminister at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, that was Indira Gandhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Ken Keating.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ken Keating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression? I mean, you had been in Belize, and all of a sudden
                    you're dealing with India. What was your impression of what we were getting out
                    of India, and also that always tricky relationship between India and Pakistan as
                    far as within our own internal State Department? Were you feeling a sense of
                    rivalry, or what were you picking up?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course, this was a time in India-Pakistan relations... Well, our
                    relations had gone through a number of cycles with Pakistan, and there was one
                    particular cycle that lasted up until 1965, the 1965 India-Pakistan War. And of
                    course I'd left the area, although not having worked specifically in India
                    immediately before the India-Pakistan War - I left the area just at that time -
                    and we did not support Pakistan in the 1965 war. We were always criticized by
                    Pakistan for that. Of course, our relationship with India had been framed by the
                    1962 Sino-Indian War, where we did help India, but not as much as they wanted.
                    So there were, as there have been always when I've worked on these issues in
                    Washington, questions of sales of particular pieces of military equipment to
                    Pakistan, resuming the sales or one-time sales - those were very much issues
                    during that period in Washington. I must admit I don't remember all the details
                    right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you picking up as you sort of arrived on the
                        Desk, awhat did we really think about Indira Gandhi at that particular
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: My recollection is that we were still learning about her. She'd come to
                    power as a compromise candidate after the death of Shastri, and she was put on
                    the throne by some of the old party bosses, expecting that they would be able to
                    manipulate her, and turned out to be a very strong person in her own right. And
                    this was a process that was going on while I was there. I don't remember the
                    exact dates of specific events, and I believe it was during that period she
                    nationalized the banks and also withdrew the privy purses from the princes, the
                    former princely rulers. So she was in the process, in that period, of
                    establishing herself more firmly, taking these very populist actions that won
                    her public support, didn't have that much effect in terms of long-term
                    development of the country (although the banks had some effect, certainly), but
                    were very clearly taken for populist reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And for you, I imagine they sliced the pie up in a certain
                        way -what part of the Indian-American relations did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as I say, being the junior political officer, I was doing a lot of
                    the political aspects of the cultural relationship - Peace Corps, AID, things
                    like that. I was fortunate in the first few months that I was there to be
                    involved in the visit of an Indian parliamentary delegation headed by the
                    speaker of Parliament, and both involved in planning the visit and actually went
                    along also as an escort officer, which as far as I was concerned was a wonderful
                    opportunity, because I got to arrange a schedule for them to see the midterm
                    elections in the United States, which gave me, of course, an opportunity to do
                    that, and did a lot of things that aren't necessarily the common way that things
                    are done. For instance, as I recall, we pooled our resources in San Francisco
                    and invited the head of the Field Poll to come and give a presentation on the
                    polling there in San Francisco at a lunchtime presentation, which went very
                    well. It also gave me the opportunity to get to know these members of the
                    delegation, because I subsequently went to India, and of course, we were old
                    buddies.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find it? I mean, I always had the impression that the upper class
                    of the Indians had picked up a certain amount of disdain for the Barbarian
                    American, picked up both internally and also from their British colleagues. Did
                    you sense any with this delegation that came through, or were they a different
                    breed of cat?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Perhaps among some of them, but not among most of them, because the
                    delegation was headed by the speaker, who was a Sikh from one of the main Sikh
                    groups, and the other members were not, for the most part, ones that would fall
                    into that category. I know very much what you mean, and I remember being
                    convinced both on this occasion, later in India, and later other places, that to
                    understand a recently independent view of the United States, you have to go back
                    and look at the mother country's view of the United States. In the case of
                    India, very much, the London School of Economics' view of the United States
                    certainly affected Nehru and a generation of senior Congress Party officials and
                    bureaucrats.</p>
                <p>Q: I've often felt that the London School of Economics and its predecessors did
                    more damage to the Third World than Lenin, Marx, and the whole group.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, India is certainly an example of that, because unlike many Third
                    World countries it was large enough to have a continental economy and to turn
                    inward and try to do everything itself in a way that many other countries could
                    not.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, how did you and your colleagues see the situation before the Bangladesh
                    thing, which at that time was East Pakistan? How did you see that situation
                    developing?</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course it began, as I recall, in March of 1971 with the crackdown
                    by the Pakistan military in East Pakistan, as it was then, which came after the
                    election in Pakistan, which had actually resulted in a majority for the main
                    politician from East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The crackdown by the
                    Pakistan military immediately resulted in this massive flood of refugees, and
                    we're talking about a magnitude that, looking at present-day situations, makes
                    present day numbers, as bad as they are, seem small, because there were 10
                    million altogether that came into India from Bangladesh, including the poor
                    peasants but also the Bengali leadership. And one of the things that I was very
                    involved with was organizing the money to transfer, as I recall, to UNHCR
                    [United Nations High Commission for Refugees] to help these, although the
                    Indians, I believe, did not want to call them refugees. They were “temporarily
                    displaced persons,” because the Indians did not want these people to stay; they
                    wanted them to go home, and they did not want to give them full refugee status.
                    The whole purpose of Indian policy was to create a situation in which they could
                    go home. Pakistan has always accused India of masterminding this whole thing so
                    that it would divide Pakistan, split off East Pakistan and become independent.
                    My view was much more that the Pakistan army, the West Pakistanis, were
                    responsible for the events that precipitated everything, but once those happened
                    and the refugees began to flow, then India, yes, Indira Gandhi, made a very
                    hard-nosed decision that India would do what was necessary to stop this problem,
                    and what was necessary to stop this problem involved training, equipping the
                    Bengalis to be fighters in East Pakistan, supporting them with the Indian Army,
                    which before the war actually started was, as I recall, operating across the
                    border into East Pakistan. So India, pressured by this massive flow of refugees,
                    did everything to force that conflict in East Pakistan, and its whole objective
                    then was to hold to the west and to liberate East Pakistan - which it did quite
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any feeling as the situation was developing, you and your
                    colleagues, that we were giving too much support for the Pakistan position and
                    too little for the Indian position on this?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Very much a sense that we were not addressing the fundamental problem of
                    this massive flow of refugees and what do you do about it - and the human rights
                    violations which had occurred in East Pakistan, which were very fully covered by
                    our team which was then in Dhaka, reported on. Mrs. Gandhi visited Washington in
                    November, 1971. I was there the day she was received at the White House. It was
                    an unusually warm day, and people were quipping about Indian summer, and of
                    course I reminded them about the real meaning of Indian summer, but she was
                    coming as a last minute effort to try to get support so that this problem could
                    be resolved diplomatically rather than as it ultimately was. And she spoke about
                    the problems that India was facing, and Nixon, as I recall, really pretty much
                    dodged that issue. There had been a cyclone in Orissa in Eastern India, and he
                    spoke about concern about that. Well, you know, in absolute terms, yes, there
                    was a lot of death and destruction from that cyclone in Orissa, but compared to
                    the 10 million people that had flowed into India from Bangladesh, this was very
                    small, and he pretty much ignored that. And I think that reflected the kind of
                    policy that was going on. People were not really focusing on the bigger
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Q: Did you see the Bangladesh, still called East Pakistan, situation sort of
                    coming out the way it did? Was there a thought that India might just plain annex
                    this and have a greater Bengal or anything like that?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember specifically considering that issue at that time. I
                    remember in looking at it later and being convinced that India definitely did
                    not want to have East Pakistan - Bangladesh - become part oIndia. India did want
                    a relationship with East Pakistan, and the bottom line for India in that
                    relationship would be that this kind of thing never happen again, that
                    Bangladesh would never cause this kind of problem for India again, that there
                    would never be a huge inflow. And of course, after Independence there still was
                    a substantial Hindu population in Bangladesh, and there were a lot of problems
                    left over from the war and before the war between the two. But no, I didn't have
                    the impression that India wanted to annex Bangladesh. India wanted primacy in
                    South Asia, wanted that to be recognized, although when you speak of India,
                    there are a lot of different factions in India and different people wanted
                    different things; but the majority positioI don't think was that they wanted to
                    take over the other countries of South Asia.</p>

                <p>SMITH: She didn't get what she wanted, and she went home, and thingprogressed

                <p>Q: I was wondering whether we were looking at... One of the major tensions in the
                    world is between Pakistan and India, and to have Pakistan in the Near Eastern
                    Bureau at that time (it's now changed) and India being in the-</p>
                <p>SMITH: No, everything was in the Near East-South Asia Bureau, sthere was no
                    problem of a scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, it was the Near East -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: - South Asia Bureau, and there was no problem of a scene. Chris Van Hollen
                    was the deputy assistant secretary for South Asia, the senior person working on
                    South Asia.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find, being part of this bureau, that Palestine sort of seemed to
                    absorb most of the tension - I mean the problems of Israel and the Arab world?
                    Did that seem to pretty well absorb the energies and attention of the
                    principals?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. There always has been that problem, and I think the only time that
                    there was somebody heading the Near East-South Asia Bureau who was really
                    interested in South Asia was actually before I joined the Foreign Service, was
                    Phil Talbot, who was there early in the Kennedy Administration, who was a South
                    Asianist. But after that, certainly, there was a problem getting attention for
                    South Asia, and I was in the bureau later; I know that that was a problem.</p>
                <p>Q: How about when the Enterprise was sent to... “Steam” isn't the right term, but
                    it used nuclear power, but its task force to go into the Indian Ocean? How did
                    that hit you all?</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SMITH: It hit us pretty hard. And you should interview some of the people who got
                    together and formed a particular group to protest. But it wasn't clear the exact
                    purpose of it. One of the problems was, and I think often is in the question of
                    ship movements, that ship movements are done and not explained - which is
                    probably part of the idea. But certainly India saw this as a threat to India,
                    and there was a lot of misinformation about exactly how far it went. Actually,
                    it didn't go very far into the Indian Ocean. I don't remember; at one time I
                    learned the exact level to which it went, but it wasn't very far up into the
                    Indian Ocean at all. But they saw this as a direct threat to India, that the
                    U.S. had sent a very powerful task force, presumed to have nuclear weapons, to
                    threaten India in a situation where India believed itself to be completely in
                    the right and where India - I don't remember the exact timing now, but it became
                    very clear after India succeeded in Bangladesh, that it was not going to begin
                    an all-out offensive against Pakistan; it was just going to hold as far as
                    Pakistan went. It wanted a cease-fire then: hold in the west, win in the east,
                    cease-fire. And the purpose of sending the Enterprise was, I believe, because we
                    did not know that that was the Indian [intent] or were not convinced or sure
                    that that was what India planned to do, and if India had planned to turn against
                    Pakistan then all out, that would have concerned us.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time, just sort of the personal feelings of those on the Indian Desk -
                    did you feel that India was justified in what it was doing?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, in what it was doing in East Pakistan in a Realpolitik kind of way,
                    India was playing a very hardheaded game and could get away with it and was
                    justified.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find after this episode was over - you were there until '72 - did you
                    feel a real lowering of relations or a hardening of relations?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, well I was not only there until 1972 but in 1972 went to New Delhi,
                    so the answer is yes. I spent much of the three years I was in India, from '72
                    to '75, explaining the Enterprise. It produced a very difficult time in our
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else that you were dealing with during
                        th'70-72 period that you think we ought to talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SMITH: One thing happened during that conflict that may have had an effect on
                    down the line, and that was that, in looking at the flow of military equipment,
                    we looked - I learned personally, not only at military sales but also at
                    commercial sales of items on the munitions list. And I remember that Chris Van
                    Hollen was very embarrassed at one point, went up to testify, and he knew about
                    FMS [Foreign Military Sales], but he hadn't looked at commercial sales. And
                    there were some commercial sales going on to Pakistan, so we had to cut those
                    off, obviously, and we also looked at some things going on to India that were
                    spare parts for, for instance, Super Constellations that we believed were being
                    used for marine reconnaissance, which gets into a whole other area of commercial
                    sales, cutoff of spare parts in times of tension, use of commercial items for
                    military purposes. And I think that the Indians were probably already determined
                    to, whenever possible, not be overly reliant on one supplier, probably for both
                    military and commercial aircraft, for example. I don't know how much notice they
                    took of what they did, but if they did, it probably confirmed their policy,
                    which later meant, of course, that they always bought both Boeing and Airbus and
                    on the military side probably a variety of weapons systems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the Soviets during this time? Was
                        thia little early, or were they making overtures to the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, they already had an established relationship with the Soviet Union.
                    You need to look at the exact year. An Indo-Soviet treaty was signed. I believe
                    it was in this period. I've always interpreted it as guaranteeing Soviet
                    neutrality or better in times of conflict. Some people have put much more
                    emphasis on the Soviet support than I think is warranted because I think India
                    was fairly self-reliant, but I think it was very reassuring to India to have in
                    the back pocket this treaty with the Soviet Union of neutrality or better in
                    time of conflict. That was important and something that, when added to the
                    Soviet military supply relationship with India, to the Soviet position on
                    Kashmir (of vetoing things that India didn't like on Kashmir) was very useful. I
                    don't remember the exact details of the Security Council consideration of the
                    India-Pakistan War of 1971, but I do remember that the Soviets took the Indian
                    side and prevented any resolution from being adopted in the Security Council
                    which would have demanded cease-fire and withdrawal before India achieved its
                    objectives.</p>

                    again, was the Enterprise, and that was related to it all. Of course, our
                    relationship with India about China had always been very complex, that we had
                    supported India in the Sino-Indian War, provided India with some materiel, but
                    not as much as they wanted, and had had some cooperative relationships in other

                    the countries of South Asia, which I managed to add a little bit on Kashmir to,
                    but basically, it was India-Pakistan, and a little bit on India-Nepal, India-Sri
                    Lanka, and India-Bangladesh.</p>

                    some impressions of India's relationships with those countries, but I don't
                    remember anything specific on the Desk.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, particularly with Nepal. It has been a very complex relationship
                    over the years, and Nepal has a terrible inferiority complex as far as India is
                    concerned, feels very... Well, India has been very heavy-handed with Nepal, and
                    Nepal reacts - let's put it that way. I may have mentioned this earlier - when
                    India put the king back on the throne in 1951, an Indian second secretary
                    participated in Nepalese cabinet meetings. That Indian second secretary, I think
                    he was, was Krishna Rasgotra, who, when I was on the India Desk in Washington,
                    was their DCM - later was their foreign secretary, some years later - and was
                    ambassador to Nepal, in fact, at one point. Just the idea of sending this person
                    back to Nepal who had such a relationship there gives an idea of the nature of
                    that dynamic between India and Nepal. India had very definite objectives with
                    Nepal. Indian intervention in Sikkim in 1972-73-74 (I forget the exact year.),
                    where India went into a country - it wasn't an independent country - to an
                    entity whose status was uncertain and, essentially, deposed the ruler because of
                    the Nepalese-speaking majority there. But Nepal always saw that as, you know,
                    potentially threatening, the kind of thing that India could do elsewhere. One of
                    the key issues in the India-Nepal relationship was water. There had been some
                    very good books written about this. When I was in Nepal, 1965-65, we learned
                    about a very large potential hydroelectric scheme, which involved taking a river
                    which has a large S in it and drilling a tunnel across - huge hydroelectric
                    potential. I was some years later - and in fact I think it was in the early '80s
                    - told that that project alone was as much as the total installed electric
                    generating capacity in north India. But of course that power had to be sold to
                    India, and that produced a very complex negotiation, with the Nepalese not
                    wanting to be totally reliant on India for market and India not wanting to be
                    reliant on Nepal as the source of this - as a result of which the project has
                    never been done, although this is the one kind of project that could be
                    tremendously beneficial for India and Nepal.</p>

                <p>SMITH: No, Sri Lanka did not become... As far as India-Sri Lanka relations were

                    to Colombo and didn't see anything particular to comment on. There had been
                    historic issues there. Indian Tamils - not just the Sri Lankan Tamils, but the
                    Indian Tamils - historic issue, but nothing big.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SMITH: Keating was the ambassador when I arrived. Moynihan came while I was there
                    and left while I was there, and Saxbe arrived. So I served under three
                    ambassadors while I was there.</p>

                <p>Q: - Israel, got there just in time, I guess, for the October War of '73, didn't
                    he; but what was the feeling about Keating at that point? I've heard people say
                    that he was getting to be an old man and really wasn't that plugged in, in a way
                    - or not? Or did you have that feeling?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I've served under a lot of ambassadors in New Delhi, and I was only there
                    briefly while Keating was there. I don't remember that he was terribly engaged,
                    but with a few exceptions, a lot of the ambassadors there were not terribly
                    engaged. He had had a difficult time during the India-Pakistan War. He had a
                    very difficult last meeting with Mrs. Gandhi. She sort of fidgeted, answered the
                    telephone, and gave very short answers, didn't really engage at all. I don't
                    remember whether other people were walking in and out of the room, but it would
                    have been consistent with what I remember hearing about the conversation. And
                    that, of course, was after the Enterprise and the war, so you can understand
                    maybe why it happened that way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the embassy when you arrived there in '72? Were
                        thefeeling sort of at odds with Washington and all, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SMITH: At odds with Washington and demoralized, and something else was going on,
                    because of course we had had an enormous mission in India during the 1960s. You
                    had the military buildup after the '62 war. We'd had a military mission there.
                    Then you had the very large AID and U.S. agriculture activities there during the
                    '60s, as we provided large amounts of aid, particularly food aid, PL-480 - very
                    large AID mission - and all of this was winding down. I should get the figures
                    for you. My wife tells of going to her first American women's club meeting when
                    she was there and there being 200 people, and when she left there were 30. It's
                    that kind of enormously... Peace Corps was on the way out. In fact, as I
                    mentioned before, it was declining before the India-Pakistan War, and that was
                    sort of the final nail in the coffin. The reason it was declining before the war
                    was explained to me by a retired Indian state official, the father of the wife
                    of a colleague in the Indian Foreign Ministry. And this retired state official
                    said to me, “You know, when the Peace Corps was bringing BA generalists with
                    enthusiasm, that was fine; what we were getting was enthusiasm. When they
                    started trying to send us technically trained people, you know, we have lots of
                    technically trained people.” So the Peace Corps was already declining for a
                    variety of reasons, and the war stopped it.AID was already declining, and
                    dwindled to almost nothing after that period, that three-year period. The
                    military mission was already much smaller and by the time I was there was down
                    to one or two or three people. So the nature of our relationship had already
                    begun to change, and the war just brought it down to a very different
                    relationship from the kind it had been in the 1960s.</p>
                <p>Q: You were watching India's relations with its near neighbors. With Pakistan by
                    half and all, did you see a changed India as far as its attitudes toward
                    neighbors, or was this of secondary interest to the Indian government?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, certainly as far as Pakistan is concerned. Pakistan was and is the
                    main issue for India, and there was, is, a hard line there in the Indian
                    government, which I think after the 19- (end of tape)</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SMITH: - was Pakistan. It's always been true that the way ahead in the Indian
                    Foreign Ministry is to be tough on Pakistan. You aren't going to get ahead by
                    broaching compromises on Pakistan. And I think after the 1971 War that was
                    reinforced. The Simla agreement at the end of the 1971 War, in July of 1972, was
                    as far as India was concerned a tremendous step forward because it basically
                    said India-Pakistan issues shall be resolved bilaterally. And in the negotiation
                    of that, Bhutto had refused some language which would have even more firmly
                    established the Indian point of view, but that much he accepted, and that pretty
                    much did establish the Indian point of view on that. So it was a period where
                    India had won a war, it felt, could be fairly firm with Pakistan. The '65 War
                    had not gone nearly as well with India. It was fought to a stalemate. The '71
                    War had gone fairly well. The Indians were proud of their success, at their
                    secularism. They would always point out that their Army chief during the time of
                    the Bangladesh War was a Parsi. The Indian Air Force chief, as I recall, was a
                    Christian. The handover was to a Sikh. There was quite a religious variety in
                    the Indian military. However, there was a lot of focus internally, within India,
                    in this period because Mrs. Gandhi had certainly won the 1971 election, which
                    occurred just before the war. She'd had an overwhelming victory in the 1971
                    election. We always thought that those populist issues that she'd succeeded at
                    before - the privy purses, the bank nationalization - had had a major effect.
                    The Bangladesh War reinforced her position. But then she began to have trouble.
                    And there's been a lot written recently, of course, about the 1973 nuclear
                    explosion and how one reason for the timing of that may have been problems she
                    had domestically.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your contacts with the Indian Foreign
                        Ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I had good relations with the Indian Foreign Ministry. We did a lot
                    with them socially. We actually made fairly good friends there. There was a
                    group in the Indian Foreign Ministry that were of similar age. Many of them come
                    into the Indian Foreign Service together, so they all knew each other, and we
                    got to know them quite well. We had good relations. They probably all thought I
                    worked for the CIA because I was so active, but no, we had very good relations,
                    relations that we've kept up over the years afterwards.</p>
                <p>Q: So this almost... “anti-Americanism” is probably not the right term, but
                    coldness towards America didn't particularly rub off in the officialdom.</p>
                <p>SMITH: You had to work at it, but if you worked at it, it was okay. And my
                    approach was always not only to work with those officials that I had to know but
                    also people who were interested in these issues outside of the Foreign Ministry,
                    which would include professors, newspaper columnists, people like that. And in
                    many cases, they were of that same age group, perhaps had gone to the same
                    universities as the people in the Foreign Ministry. It was a pleasant time in
                    that sense. As I said, it took work, but it was possible. Sometimes, some things
                    weren't possible. I was never able to visit Sikkim, and I was told basically
                    that I wasn't going to be able to visit Sikkim because they were too suspicious
                    of me.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Q: What about the other confrontational relationship that you probably had to
                    deal with, and that is with our embassy in Islamabad. There must have been a
                    counterpart who dealt with Pakistan-Indian relationships. How did that work?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember that as being a particularly confrontational time. I
                    visited Pakistan once or twice during that period, visited all of the
                    neighboring countries, in fact - except China - during that period. I don't
                    remember it being a particularly tense relationship. I was trying to think back
                    about it, and I just don't remember it being that bad, although I'm sure that we
                    did disagree about these key issues of, usually, arms supply.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Yes, they did, and we never really recovered from the dispatch of the
                    Enterprise. Of course, during two of the three years I was there, Moynihan was
                    the ambassador, and Moynihan had an access in Washington which was very useful.
                    And I think, you know, if anybody could get a point across in Washington, he
                    probably could.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I explained it very much in the lines I mentioned earlier, that they
                    should see this as part of our relationship with China. They should recognize
                    that even though the Indian intent during this period may have been very clear
                    to Indians, to deal with East Pakistan and call it finished, it wasn't
                    necessarily clear to others on the outside - but also to explain, to get in some
                    of the details of... The Enterprise really had just barely got into the Indian

                    still a factor in our relations.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, actually, for about three months, I was his staff assistant and was
                    offered the job on a longer-term basis, and instead I really... The job in the
                    Political Section had been one I had been after for a long time and would like
                    to return to it. He was an ambassador who could deal with those Indian
                    politicians and officials of the London School of Economics background and
                    otherwise, could deal with them on an equal footing because of his own
                    intellectual background. It was fascinating to watch him work the issues in
                    Washington, in many cases, to write a telegram, then go back to Washington to
                    negotiate the response. It was fascinating to watch him in his dealings with the
                    press, because this was a period in which within India he had very low
                    visibility. He only gave one press conference while he was there, and that was
                    just before he left. And he was asked a question about Diego Garcia. This is
                    probably in his book. He quipped that he didn't know why India was getting so
                    worked up about the Indian Ocean. “It's only a chance of history that it was
                    called the Indian Ocean. It could have been called the Madagascar Sea.” But he
                    did spend a lot of time with the American press. We noticed that... He wrote his
                    own telegrams, I should back up and say. He was somebody who would... I remember
                    learning as an undergraduate in college that Woodrow Wilson had a portable
                    typewriter and used to sit there in the White House and type things. Well,
                    Moynihan had a portable electric typewriter in his office, and he worked sort of
                    ten to two and four to eight. He would sit there in the evening and write these
                    long cables. Sometimes they'd be about a meeting he'd had. Sometimes they'd be
                    about an issue. And sometimes they would appear in the New York Times within a
                    couple of days.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The one that I remember the most was one he did about the return of the
                    South Building to the Indian government. The South Building had been constructed
                    with PL-480 funds for the use of AID. AID was shrinking dramatically, had no use
                    for this building, which was in the southern part of New Delhi, and had decided
                    to turn it back to the Indian government as provided for in the original
                    agreement on the use of PL-480 funds. And at the last minute AID Washington had
                    second thoughts, and he sent back this blistering cable that talked about great
                    empires building these enormous buildings in their period of decline, which he
                    called an “edifice complex.” But of course, he always says that his biggest
                    achievement, the one for which he will always be remembered, is his ending the
                    rupee problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, would you explain what it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, let me say that Moynihan was somebody who would jump into an issue
                    and work on it. Sometimes he would only work on it briefly. In fact, we often
                    thought that he was ideally suited to be a senator. But in this case, he worked
                    the issue thoroughly through to the end. The issue concerned this enormous
                    quantity of Indian rupees we'd accumulated by selling wheat during the 1960s to
                    India for rupees in those two years of drought. The rupees, a very small
                    percentage we could use for our administration, but most of them could only be
                    used by joint agreement and, in fact, were piling up faster than we were
                    spending them - the interest on them was piling up faster than we were spending
                    - and the amount was enormous. I think it was something like more than the total
                    amount of money in circulation in India. The Indian press and public opinion saw
                    this as a threat to economic stability in India, although in fact it couldn't be
                    used without the approval of the government of India. In economic terms it
                    didn't mean anything, but in political terms it meant a great deal. So Moynihan
                    negotiated an agreement under which we turned back two-thirds of the rupees, and
                    he handed over a check of that amount to the Indian government, the largest
                    check ever written. At the time, he thought that we had saved enough to continue
                    our educational and cultural programs, our scientific research programs (which
                    were funded with rupees), through the end of the century. He was a few years
                    off. The money ran out sooner than that, but the concept was to take a major
                    political problem the heart of which was this infinite amount of rupees and turn
                    it into a finite issue that would end in a certain amount of years, which he
                    succeeded in doing.</p>
                <p>I sometimes had an impression that after that and after the Kissinger visit (the
                    details of which I don't remember much of now but that would have been in 1974),
                    he sort of lost interest. So he left and was replaced by Saxbe.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it then that Moynihan did not fall into... I won't call it “the trap,”
                    but certainly the pattern that a number of our ambassadors have, of coming to
                    India and becoming so entranced with it that their objectivity is at least
                    seriously in question as far as people who deal with Indian affairs back in
                    Washington or even on their own staff are concerned.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I certainly don't think he was perceived in Washington the way Chester
                    Bowles was seen. Chester Bowles was seen as a total apologist for India, and
                    Moynihan was not that. He was on occasion -</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, but Moynihan was certainly critical of individual Indians. I can
                    remember some very, very critical cables that he wrote. I think to get a full
                    impression of this you need to go back and review the telegrams of the time,
                    which now should be available.</p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SMITH: I don't recall. I probably did, but I don't recall. It was better than the
                    Keating relationship, definitely, but I don't recall that it was particularly
                    warm. I could be wrong.</p>
                <p>Q: I can't think of anything; I'm just thinking that Mrs. Gandhi didn't take
                    fools lightly, and I don't think Moynihan did either. They may have sat there
                    and had self-satisfied smirks on their face in each other's company, but-</p>
                <p>SMITH: If you've done one of these with Dave Schneider - he was DC- he would have
                    a much better recollection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the nuclear explosion - did that sort of change things
                        as faas the relationships, how we viewed India at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it definitely did. I must admit, I've recently been reading
                    articles about this, so I'm not sure what I remember myself and what I read in
                    the articles, but before that we had had a relationship with the Indian atomic
                    energy establishment, which ended abruptly with that. We cut off all contacts -
                    as to the Canadians, from whose heavy water reactor the plutonium raw material
                    may have come. I think the Indians were surprised, probably, by our reaction.
                    The Indian explanation of this as a peaceful nuclear explosion was seen widely
                    as an example of typical Indian posturing. Indians, Indian diplomats, have
                    always had a troubled relationship with Americans and many Westerners, and this
                    was an area which was a particular issue, I think, because it was just so
                    transparent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, were there any other problems or issues during this
                        '72 t'75 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There probably were, but I'm not sure that I remember them. I did manage
                    to get up to Kashmir a couple of times. We were still a bit careful about how we
                    traveled to Kashmir, but I did get up there a couple of times on vacations and
                    managed to call on the governor and other officials whom I knew - from
                    Washington, in fact. I also managed to travel around the southern part of the
                    country a fair amount, doing speaking for USIS. And the latter was during the
                    Watergate period. The Indian interest in Watergate was considerable. It was not
                    like the situation in Europe, where they didn't really understand it - France,
                    “affaire des plombiers.” The Indians related to it in an interesting way,
                    because here is a prescient who is being accused of abusing his office, of
                    elements of “imperial presidency,” and ultimately has to resign. And in India
                    they have a leader who is being accused of abusingpower, later more than at that
                    time but already at that time, being challenged in the court about various
                    things involving election practices, is removing chief ministers around the
                    country; so the Indians followed it very closely, and I often thought that they
                    related to it in the sense that, Gee, they can do that in the United States,
                    maybe we can do that here.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Q: It's interesting, isn't it, because I know the European - I was in Greece at
                    the time, and there was no real understanding of this. I mean, “Everybody does
                    this, and what's the big deal?”</p>
                <p>SMITH: It was always difficult in India, because with the parliamentary system,
                    they didn't understand our system, so in talking about it, you had to do some
                    basic Civics 101 to explain the American system. But they were very interested
                    in it. And of course the Indians have always had journalists in Washington.
                    There has been a group of Indian correspondents in Washington, so they were
                    getting a lot of reporting about it. There's a considerable amount of reporting
                    in the Indian press on international things, and a fair amount on the United
                    States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do we view the Kashmir problem? It really goes back to
                        '48, doesn't it? I mean, essentially a done deal, with a lot of squabbling
                        but probably little is going to change there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think that after the 1971 War, we did, that the 1971 War brought
                    an end to a U.S. policy which had initially been one of supporting a plebiscite
                    and later had been one of trying to work out agreements. In 1963, after the
                    Sino-Indian War in particular, we tried to broker an agreement between India and
                    Pakistan, even suggesting dividing Kashmir - deals there. But in 1971, with the
                    Simla agreement, which says “issues between the two countries shall be resolved
                    bilaterally,” I was one who advocated, no, let them do it. Third parties can be
                    available, but they said they're going to do it bilaterally, and the easy way
                    for the United States to handle the problem in both countries is to say Simla.
                    And later on, in 1982, I advocated that line as well.</p>

                    favored our backing off, and I think we did back off.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there is a State Department fellow at the Council on Foreign
                    Relations, a one year assignment up there. In addition, the Council on Foreign
                    Relations has a program of foreign affairs fellows for younger professors,
                    government officials, State Department officers. I had applied under the latter
                    and was assigned there by the State Department under the former. So I, in fact,
                    was sort of both.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I had developed a project to look at U.S.-Soviet competition in
                    Third World countries and spent a fair amount of time researching that, came
                    away with the conclusion that there was actually a lot less competition than
                    people thought. I hadn't realized until I really got down to it how little the
                    Soviets were actually doing, how little they could deliver, how their economic
                    aid was virtually nonexistent, how the only thing that they could deliver was
                    military assistance in a few locations, but their economic aid - I mean this
                    pattern of Soviet announcements of huge amounts of aid and then delivering next
                    to nothing was one that was repeated time after time after time around the
                    world.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, that's very interesting. What was your impression of the role of the
                    Council on Foreign Relations? Was it a holding area for those who were out of
                    power to come back in, or a training ground?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, all of the above. Certainly, there were a lot of people there who had
                    been prominent or who would again be prominent, the revolving door aspect of it.
                    There was a conscious effort, particularly later but somewhat when I was there,
                    of bringing younger people in who later became prominent. They have every year a
                    State Department fellow and two military fellows. One of the military fellows
                    when I was there was Colonel McPeak, who later went on to be chief of staff of
                    the Air Force, and the Army fellow who was there was Gene Dewey, with whom I'm
                    now up at Carlisle, who later went on to be number two in UNHCR. And every year
                    they have a journalistic fellow who's there, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find that what you were... You wrote this paper, which really should
                    have been the sort of thing INR would be doing, and all that. Were you able to
                    insert it into the system, to say, “Hey, fellows, look at what's really
                    happening?”</p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I never got as far as drawing all of the policy conclusions that would
                    come from that, and really, the Council is interested in the policy conclusions.
                    And in fact, I wasn't there as long as I originally expected because my next
                    assignment required some French language training and I came down to Washington
                    for French language training, so I was only there about nine months.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, this was our first time in a former French colony, and our
                    experience had been very much in former British colonies up until then, having
                    served in, well, three plus Nepal, which of course had its main relationship
                    with the UK. So it was quite a... The nature of former French colonialism is
                    very different from the nature of former British colonialism, and it took a lot
                    of adjusting. I mean the French cultural imperialism and even more so in some
                    ways than India, the Francophone African view of the United States comes by way
                    of Paris, came by way of Paris, anyway. To back up a bit, later, when I was
                    traveling some years later, I had an opportunity to be at a luncheon with
                    Houphou�t-Boigny.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Ivory Coast. And the person I was with didn't speak French - I was a
                    bag-carrier - so I had an opportunity to have some conversation in French
                    separately. And I asked Houphou�t about the French and the British, as colonial
                    masters, and he said, “Well, you know, it's as if there are two masters and each
                    of them has a dog, and one is very rich, but he makes the dog sleep outside, but
                    the other is poor and the dog sleeps in the bedroom.” It was very clear which
                    he... Houphou�t, who had been a senator in France before independence, where he
                    thought... and in Bangui we could see elements of very much assimilated Central
                    Africans there, or Africans. The economic relationship was particularly
                    striking, that the French had maintained an economic relationship in a way that
                    the UK had not, after it gave up its colonies, and had maintained a control
                    through the economic relationship. The Central African franc, being issued for
                    all of he Central African countries, was pegged to the French franc, 50 to 1,
                    and the Central African Republic could not print money. The French had a veto in
                    the bank on printing the money. So when it came time to pay the troops, if the
                    government didn't have the money, it couldn't just print it, it had to get a
                    loan. To get a loan, really, it had to go to France. So the French could decide,
                    well, do we want a coup or not? Pay the troops or not? It gave them tremendous
                    influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, what did you see as American
                        interestin the Central African Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Fairly small - some trade interests. There, in fact, was an American
                    company trading in diamonds there. Some human rights interests, some
                    humanitarian interests. I don't recall any deep security interests, although of
                    course that was a period of U.S.-Soviet competition, and we were trying to keep
                    those votes and those countries on our side to the extent possible.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned human rights - because you were there by '77, when the Carter
                    Administration came in. What sort of issues were human rights issues there?</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, Bokassa himself became a human rights issue and became a human
                    rights issue while I was there but even more so after I left, in the sense that
                    he was extremely arbitrary, ran a very arbitrary system, and while I was there
                    threw one American and one British journalist in jail, beat the British
                    journalist before he threw him in jail, which certainly got everybody's
                    attention - the fact that the British journalist was on his way to have dinner
                    with me when he got thrown in jail. And later there was a case of a Peace Corps
                    volunteer who I don't think he got beaten but got thrown in jail and got thrown
                    out of the country, for just stopping in front of one of the emperor's houses
                    and asking questions. It was a very arbitrary government, and it was only later
                    that the mistreatment of the schoolchildren occurred, which became the major
                    human rights issue and ultimately resulted in the French deposing Bokassa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did Tony Quainton use you as a DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We were very small. We had an ambassador, a DCM, a junior officer, a
                    couple of others - an administrative officer. We had some AID projects, so I was
                    very involved in self-help projects, AID projects in building a new chancery,
                    which we succeeded in doing while I was there, political reporting, a little bit
                    of everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Bokassa while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think that we were always suspicious of him, but only as things went on
                    did we come to know how arbitrary and irrational he was. And as we were trying
                    to do some AID projects there, it became clear that the more we learned about
                    Bokassa the more we realized that this was going to be difficult. His
                    administration, Central Africans in general, were very suspicious of foreigners.
                    We thought at first that this was a racial thing, but some of the African
                    diplomats there also had trouble. It may have been particularly Central Africa -
                    I mean, this was a country which had been very badly treated by the slave
                    raiders. Slave trading in that country or raiding in that country continued into
                    the 20th century, slave raiders coming down from the north.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There was a slave-raiding area in the northern part of the country which
                    existed until 1911, 1914, and people could still remember. So that may have been
                    an element. Bokassa's background in the French military may have been a
                    background. But as it went on, we began, I think, to get a better appreciation
                    of him. Tony Quainton has probably told you some of the stories about
                    Bokassa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He was certainly cunning, and he went through this wholthing with
                    Qadhafi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Qadhafi visited - I don't remember which year it was - well, it must have
                    been in '76, before he became emperor, certainly before the coronation - '76 or
                    early '77. The huge display for him, some of it must have been particularly
                    strange for a Muslim who considered himself a serous Muslim. All of the African
                    women out there dancing and singing “As-salaam 'aleikum,” shaking-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially topless, weren't they, at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, no, they weren't topless, but they were shaking their bodies. He was
                    there for a couple of days. I didn't go to the big dinner for him. Tony Quainton
                    did. But the result of the visit was that Bokassa converted to Islam, and one or
                    more of his ministers also. It was widely believed that there was a considerable
                    under-the-table payment, of a million dollars or something, just for this
                    conversion, plus a promise of various other things, including weapons. Of
                    course, a few months later, he declared the empire, declared himself Bokassa
                    Klimin, and he later told Tony Quainton (I was with him.) that the whole thing
                    was planned - what did he say - “Il est malin, mais je suis plus malin que lui.
                    [He is cunning, but I am more cunning than he is.]”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Malin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Malin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: “Cunning.” So he presented this, anyway, as something that he had planned,
                    the whole thing of having Qadhafi visit, getting these payoffs, getting some
                    arms, and then converting, and then delaying the empire, declaring himself
                    Bokassa Premier, having a coronation mass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Pope sent a representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. We did not send a special representative from Washington. It
                    was interesting that the Chinese, the Americans, and the Russians, all used
                    their local ambassadors, did not send special representatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the French went pretty far, didn't they, on this
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They did. The French obviously knew a lot more about Bokassa than we did.
                    As I said, in the course of the two years I was there, we gradually got to know
                    and understand him more, and I think the incident of the two journalists, the
                    incident of the Peace Corps volunteer, and then some things we heard from the
                    French after those - we really realized how arbitrary and irrational he was, and
                    therefore we weren't surprised at what happened later, the killing of the
                    schoolchildren, or Bokassa beat the schoolchildren to death, although that was
                    farther than he had gone, that we knew about anyway. But he had beaten people.
                    He did drink prodigious amounts of whiskey, and there was one incident with a
                    Russian at the Soviet embassy where a busload of Soviet embassy staff member
                    were going by his - he didn't call it his palace - his farm, about an hour south
                    of the capital, and they were stopped at the checkpoint and they were taken in
                    and harangued. I don't think they were beaten, but treated very badly, detained
                    and harangued and everything. But in the course of the hours that they were
                    there, he drank a huge amount of scotch, and by the end of it he was maudlin,
                    and they were the greatest friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there cunning behind this irrational behavior, or was
                        hcunning but also irrational?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think he was cunning but also irrational. He did have an addiction to
                    liquor. He had no concept of dividing state funds and personal funds. And after
                    the coronation we discovered that the cotton stabilization fund was empty, or
                    almost empty. It had so much before and this much afterward. He was useful in
                    some ways, in the sense that he was a friend of Mobutu. He supported Zaire in
                    the problems it had in Shaba in '77-78. They were very much with the French in
                    areas that were of concern to us; that was helpful. But clearly there was a
                    large element of bad judgment on his part. He would go off to France for long
                    periods, spend huge amounts of money, give away diamonds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women, were there problems as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: There were always problems with women. I forget how manwives and children
                    he had, but there were always stories of others.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. What about the Congo-Brazzaville? That was at that time still a Marxist
                    r�gime which was very much in our bad books. Was there any particular connection
                    with the Central African. It abuts onto it?</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember any particular connection. The only connection I remember
                    is that the plane, the jet Air France-Air Afrique route went to Brazzaville and
                    then to Bangui, so we occasionally saw people just because of that. Much of our
                    contact was with Cameroon, which is adjoining. The AID mission which supported
                    Bangui was located in Cameroon and for us was a big city.</p>

                    the Algerian role, the question of U.S. arms sales to Morocco in that context.
                    There was a huge issue of U.S. arms sales to Morocco, F-5 sales, as I recall -
                    would we sell them, and how many would we sell them, what effect would that have
                    on this dispute, what effect would it have on our relationship with Algeria?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Dick Parker. Dick Parker left, basically because, I always felt, the king
                    saw Parker as somebody who knew too much about the country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, Dick Parker had written a book, a Baedeker type book on Islamic
                    monuments in Morocco. He'd been, I believe, DCM there, knew the country
                    extremely well, and I always felt that - you're right - the king much preferred
                    pliable political appointees, and the king raised an objection to Parker. He did
                    it in a meeting with a high-level representative from Washington - I don't
                    remember who it was - but the ambassador was excluded from the meeting, and we
                    learned about it from the interpreter. Parker left, and Angier Biddle Duke went

                <p>SMITH: Well, there was an academic interpretation of him, a book, Commander of
                    the Faithful, which I always considered quite accurate, that he ruled by smoke
                    and mirrors. He was somebody who manipulated the political system to retain his
                    control and stay in power - quite effectively - and had for some years and has
                    continued to do so.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that there was a problem being on the Morocco Desk, because the
                    Polisario movement seems to be sort of like the Biafran one and other ones where
                    a certain amount of - oh, particularly in Congress, often in the congressional
                    staff, there are people who sort of are friends of these rebel movements and
                    all. Was this a problem for you?</p>

                <p>SMITH: Steve Solarz was a problem, or Steve Solarz's staff. My recollection is
                    that at that time, I'm fairly sure, North Africa and certainly this issue was
                    included in the African Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and
                    Solarz therefore took a considerable interest in it and had somebody on his
                    staff who followed it very closely and went out to the field, went to... I don't
                    remember that he went to the Western Sahara. I do remember that he went to that
                    part of Algeria where the Polisario headquarters was and objected strongly to
                    the proposed F-5 sales to Morocco.</p>
                <p>Q: How were you attributing this? I mean, what did you feel was causing this
                    support of the Polisario side?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember specifics at this point. I suppose it had to do in part
                    with the fact that Morocco had pretty much sort of moved in and taken over. And
                    there hadn't been a referendum; there hadn't been an opportunity for this area
                    to make a choice, and I don't remember that the Moroccan legal case was all that
                    strong.</p>
                <p>Q: Outside of the F-5, which was at the time our standard fighter plane for
                    export, where there any other... How did that come out? Did we finally get some
                    there?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I must admit I don't remember the details. I don't remember the details. I
                    don't remember any other major issue while I was there. There was the broader
                    issue of the relationship. The king visited while I was on the Desk. Here was a
                    country that had been a historic ally. We'd had military bases there. We'd had a
                    very close relationship, had been very useful to us in a variety of areas.
                    Moroccan troops had gone to Zaire. Morocco had always been very
                    middle-of-the-road as far as the Arab-Israel dispute had been concerned. So he
                    was an extremely valuable ally. On the other hand, we weren't supporting him
                    fully in his problem in the Western Sahara, and that created a lot of obvious
                    friction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Israeli connection? Did that come up at all
                        whilyou were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The fact that there were contacts between the Israelis anthe
                    Moroccans?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember the history of those. As I recall, they were a fact at
                    that point. I don't remember the details, though. Certainly there was a Jewish
                    community in Morocco.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's see, I guess in 1980 what did you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SMITH: I moved over to the Bureau of UN Political Affairs again to be one of the
                    deputy directors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did that from 1980 to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: - to '82.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '82. Now I would imagine that was a rather stormy
                        period,particularly with the Reagan Administration taking on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, particularly, I was working on... They divided the deputy directors.
                    The other deputy director did the Middle East and disarmament issues, and I did
                    Africa, Puerto Rico, Micronesia, and institutional issues. But the one that took
                    up the most time was southern Africa - or South Africa and Namibia were the two
                    issues, primarily. And that was an area where the arrival of the Reagan
                    Administration turned us round 180 degrees. Again, I've been reading articles
                    and books on that, so my impressions may be affected by those; but I certainly
                    remember that the work of Don McHenry on Namibia in particular, the contact
                    group - you know, very serious, thought progress had been made, and then the
                    Reagan Administration came in and sort of changed the ground rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the better, for the worse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as it turned out, the problem was solved, in a very complicated way.
                    Whether it would have been solved otherwise I don't know. Certainly the South
                    Africans were not on board for solving it the way the contact group had been
                    trying to solve it. And the way the Reagan Administration, constructive
                    engagement, did ultimately result in a solution. But it was quite a change.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that particularly right at the beginning - you arrived in
                    1980, the election took place, Reagan came on board, Jean Kirkpatrick went to
                    the United Nations - this represented, at least at the beginning, sort of the
                    pretty far right of the Republican administration, because the UN had always
                    been a focus. There had always been a sort of an anti-UN movement. Was there a
                    feeling of discouragement or what?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think on the southern African issues there was, and also on other
                    issues. Of course, she resurrected an effort that Moynihan had started to keep
                    track of voting records, and I'm trying to remember whether this was later
                    mandated by Congress or not, but when she resurrected it I don't think it had
                    been - to start charting how countries vote in the UN compared to how we vote,
                    which is a very complicated question and one where if you just look at numbers
                    you don't get much understanding. You have to look at what's behind them. She
                    certainly resurrected that approach, and a very hard-headed one, of looking at
                    the voting percentages of countries in the United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was tied to our support, financial or otherwise,
                        wasn'it? Or at least -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No... Do you mean tied to our support of those countries?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, it could be, in that case, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because otherwise it wouldn't make much difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, she wanted it to become a factor in our relationship with those
                    countries. And we began - I don't remember exactly what year - but that
                    ultimately resulted in the publication of the lists of how countries are
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find a major change in the... You're basically the backup for
                    the embassy at the United Nations in New York, aren't you? Did you find a major
                    change when the new mission to the United Nations under Jean Kirkpatrick came
                    into operation?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, she moved people out. There were more political appointees. And
                    again, on particular issues, there was a very wrenching change of direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you all respond to this? Was it grumbling in the
                        ranks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: On the South African issues there was, yes, grumbling in the ranks. Of
                    course, that wasn't just Jean Kirkpatrick in New York; it was also Chet Crocker
                    in Washington. So we were dealing with new leadership in New York, new
                    leadership in the African Bureau, and they both together were changing the
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Chet Crocker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very convinced on his approach, certainly. But again, it's always hard to
                    test whether it worked or not. Thinking specifically of Namibia, we did feel
                    that it was undercutting the efforts, not only our, but the UN efforts on
                    Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was money an issue at all during this time, paying UN
                        dues, odid that come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It came later. It was not, as I recall, an issue then, although we might
                    have begun to cheat then, in the sense of - I forget what year it was when we
                    began to pay our dues late, cheat in that sense. But the big issue came
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was always hard to get money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, international issues that you were dealing with -
                        did you deal with UNESCO [United Nations Economic, Social, and Cultural
                        Organization] and those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Didn't deal with UNESCO. I dealt with Micronesia, dealt - to the extent
                    that we got involved - with the Puerto Rican issue. There were some - I don't
                    remember the details of them now - institutional issues: Security Council
                    enlargement, things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Puerto Rican issue - could you explain what the Puerto
                        Ricaissue was, and how we felt about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course, the basic issue is a political issue within Puerto Rico
                    and with - in the United States, and very hard for these two political processes
                    to mesh in a way that will come to a decision. It's a question of statehood or
                    commonwealth, and then some people want independence. In the UN, as I recall, it
                    came up in the committee of 24, which was the anti-colonialism committee of the
                    General Assembly, where we always had to have an effort to make our point that
                    Puerto Rico, in the various referenda which had occurred, had clearly voted
                    against independence and that this was not an issue for that committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is just a finger in our eye, wasn't it, on the
                        part oCuba and some other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, basically. It was not a major issue in the UN, but obviously one
                    which had to be dealt with, and one in which we had a considerable... a good
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I mean, the referenda were there all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, and I don't remember the details. I think we may have had some study
                    groups go to Puerto Rico from the UN, from the Committee of 24. I don't even
                    know whether that committee is still in existence.</p>
                <p>Micronesia was an issue, because then we were grappling with the question of...
                    Micronesia was, I think, the last issue before the Trusteeship Council, and we
                    had to report to the Trusteeship Council every year on Micronesia, and it was a
                    very complicated series of questions. Does it become independent as a whole, or
                    in pieces? What kind of independence is it? Does some of it become U.S.
                    territory? Very complicated questions where we ultimately prevailed in getting a
                    system established where these countries are independent but with guidance and
                    where, as I recall, we got it out of the Trusteeship Council.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that it was a constant battle during this time with the Soviet
                    Union on all these issues, from your perspective, or did they sort of keep out
                    of something like Namibia and all?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember. I must admit I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably wasn't much of an issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Of course, the Soviet Union was active in Angola, and Angola was active in
                    Namibia, supporting the Namibian... I'm sure that the Soviets were very vocal in
                    supporting SWAPO, the Namibian independence organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '82, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In early 1982, not in the normal rotation cycle, there was a sudden and
                    unexpected vacancy in the job of political counselor in New Delhi, and they
                    asked me to come to New Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like kind of fun, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Coming back to New Delhi, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from '82 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: '84.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we cover this period, then I think -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Okay, fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was India like coming back? I mean, you had left in,
                        what,'75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, came back in '82. Well, I used to tell people, “Well, I left in '75.
                    Indira Gandhi was prime minister. I came back in 1982. Indira Gandhi's prime
                    minister. Plus �a change... [The more things change...]” In fact, a lot had
                    happened domestically in the meantime, in the sense that the Congress Party had
                    lost an election in 1977, in fact had lost an election because of what began
                    just weeks before I'd left in 1975, which was the Declaration of Emergency and
                    the limitation of civil rights during that Emergency and the active, coercive,
                    family planning program during that Emergency period. They'd lost the 1977
                    election. A coalition opposition government was in power that lasted fairly
                    briefly. By the time I got back in '82, Mrs. Gandhi was back in power, and a lot
                    of the same players. The relationship with Pakistan probably hadn't changed all
                    that much.</p>
                <p>Of course, the big even that had affected our relationship with Pakistan, and
                    therefore our relationship with India, had been the Soviet invasion of
                    Afghanistan. And that colored things a great deal during this period, in the
                    sense that we - particularly under the Reagan Administration - had come out in
                    full support of Pakistan. The Indians had opposed even the very limited package
                    of support that Carter had proposed, and of course very much opposed the support
                    to Pakistan which Reagan was providing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought the Indians would have not been happy
                        abouthe Soviets moving into Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They weren't happy, but they were even less happy about our relationship
                    with Pakistan and our rearming of Pakistan. It varied, of course, from Indian to
                    Indian, including some of their diplomats. They had very different view on what
                    the Soviets had done. India, as I recall, had a somewhat ambivalent position on
                    the whole thing, but they were definitely against what we were doing in support
                    oPakistan, because their line was basically, this is like the situation before
                    1965; Pakistan wants those weapons to use against us, not against the Russians,
                    but against us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The whole time I was there it was Harry Barnes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Harry Barnes was a professional. How was he as
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I had worked for Harry Barnes once before, when he was DCM in Kathmandu in
                    1964-65. Harry Barnes was very good to work for. He spoke Hindi. He wanted
                    people in his embassy to speak Hindi. In fact, he insisted that I - or
                    encouraged me to - have a month of brush-up Hindi before I came out. He
                    encouraged everybody to get out, to travel. I often thought that his approach to
                    India was very much that this was a country with which there was a lot we could
                    do. There were a lot of areas of common interest. He wasn't sure quite which one
                    was going to work, so he pushed on this broad range of issues, drove us crazy
                    sometimes because there was an element of not setting priorities. But in
                    retrospect, it was probably pushing on a broad range of issues to see which
                    would work, and some of the ones worked which people did not expect to work,
                    such as the beginning of a relationship in the defense area. He would go around
                    to see the science advisor in the Ministry of Defense, and I accompanied him on
                    several of these calls. We sort of entered by the back stairway, because the
                    idea of the American ambassador calling on the Ministry of Defense was very
                    strange, so we'd sort of come in the back way, get taken upstairs separately.
                    But we were discussing sort of the beginning of a relationship in the high-tech
                    area.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we beginning to see an India that was beginning to connect to... You
                    mentioned that they said they had a lot of people technically trained. I was
                    wondering whether you were beginning to see India looking towards what was to
                    become the computer age. They had a very talented population evidently?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it was the beginning of the end for the India which had been
                    created under Nehru, with all of the statist economic controls, the London
                    School of Economics approach to economics. The former Indian ambassador in
                    Washington, L. K. Jah had been brought back to dismantle many of the controls
                    that he had put in place. This was something we saw a great deal of later, but
                    it was beginning in that period, as I recall. Again, there are others who would
                    remember that aspect of it better than I would</p>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, that occurred during that period, and I had some Sikh friends. One of
                    them had been the speaker of Parliament who had come to the United States on
                    that Parliamentary delegation in 1970, a leader in the Congress Party in Punjab
                    - just devastated by this. And her action in sending troops into the Golden
                    Temple in Amritsar later led to terrible things, but certainly when I was there,
                    the Sikh reaction to this was uniform, very, very negative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought about this confrontation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there were a group of Sikhs who reportedly had received some support
                    from Mrs. Gandhi or the Congress Party earlier on in a game of power politics or
                    balancing factions within the state of Punjab, a group of Sikhs who wanted
                    independence for a Sikh state - Kalistan - and they were not supported by the
                    majority of the people of Punjab, but some of them did have weapons and they
                    were killing people.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, my recollection is that some of these militants were holed up in
                    there, and she could have probably handled it differently, but she ended up
                    sending troops in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, but on the other hand... Well, she certainly faced a problem, of
                    these armed Sikhs - their arms, presumably, were coming through Pakistan - not
                    supported by the majority of the Sikh population but very definitely undertaking
                    terrorist acts in Punjab. And India has faced problems before, particularly in
                    border areas and groups wanting independence, particularly in the northeast, and
                    historically has dealt with those with a combination of firmness and tact - very
                    hard-nosed dealing with the counterinsurgency and then at some point negotiating
                    - and has tended to adopt that approach elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, as political counselor, were you looking at India and looking not to
                    glory in it but just to see that this was a state that could divide up? Were
                    there fissures in India along religious lines or regional lines?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think that we were looking at it that way. It's a good question.
                    Interestingly enough, it was a better question in the late 1950s, and by the
                    1980s very few people saw the likelihood of India breaking up. In the late
                    1950s, both Indians and foreign observers saw this as a real possibility. Jim
                    Grant, who was later head of UNICEF, told me in Delhi once - he had served in
                    our mission there in the AID mission in the late '50s. John Sherman Cooper, one
                    of the ambassadors in that period, and he said that it was right after the
                    creation of the linguistic states in India. That was done in 1957, so it must
                    have been the '57-58 period. He said the ambassador drew his country team
                    together and asked two questions: one, will India still be united in 10 years
                    and, two, if it is united, will it still be a democracy? And the country team
                    split fairly evenly on the first question and was fairly uniform on the second
                    question that if it was still united it would not still be a democracy. And by
                    25 years later, if you had done the same thing, I don't think the country team
                    would have felt that India was likely to split up, and would also have felt that
                    democracy was extremely well-established there - parliamentary democracy in the
                    sense of elections and the system that they had. So that was not something that
                    we were looking at that much. In the case of the issue of Kalistan, I think we
                    were convinced that the Indian government would prevail, partly because we
                    didn't see great support for it within the Sikh community. It had arisen in part
                    because of splits within the Sikh community. The Sikh community was very
                    divided, but it wasn't largely supporting this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a strong “old Indian hand” cadre that was
                        working oIndia at this time in our own Foreign Service and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Not that many old India hands left.</p>

                <p>Q: I'm not talking about going way back, but I mean people who had been around a

                    much people coming in on excursion tours?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, let's see. Marion Creekmore was the DCM. His background was not
                    South Asia. Harry Barnes was the closest to an old India hand at that point. I
                    was political counselor. I had served in both Pakistan and Nepal and previously
                    in India. In the political section, my labor counselor was an old India hand. I
                    don't remember who else we had there. Ernie Heck was there during that period, I
                    think. She was an old India hand. So yes, we did have some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations down south, the Tamil side and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The problem began in that period, in the sense that it was 1983 when you
                    had the... I don't remember the exact sequence, but there was a killing, bodies
                    were brought back in Colombo, riots in Colombo, a lot of killing of Tamils. It
                    was a problem which had been going on for some years, and it suddenly became
                    very clear the extent of alienation between the Tamil and the Singhalese
                    community in those riots in the summer of 1983, which was what later led to the
                    establishment of the guerilla groups and the current civil war that's going on
                    there. But it was something that had its origins, many people think, in the
                    policies of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike in 1956, when he was first elected under a
                    Sinhala-only policy, emphasizing the Singhalese language and culture and
                    dividing the educational systems - because before that they had been educated
                    together, and after that they were educated separately. So it goes back a long
                    way, but it really bubbled to the surface in 1983.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find American relations with India by this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SMITH: Improved. Harry Barnes was working on them hard, and I don't remember the
                    nature of our economic relationship in this particular period, but I do remember
                    that he was working very hard on things like building a military relationship, a
                    lot of very active personal diplomacy, quiet diplomacy - not only quiet, in the
                    sense that with his Hindi language capability he had some public diplomacy as
                    well. I accompanied him in October of 1982 on a trip to Kashmir, which may have
                    been one of the first ones in some time by an American ambassador. It was a very
                    good trip. Before we went, he said, “Grant, I'll only go to Kashmir if you tell
                    me what to say about he Kashmir issue.” And I said, “Mr. Ambassador, the answer
                    is very easy. There's one word: Simla.” And later, and I think Ron Spiers was in
                    Pakistan at the time, and they later collaborated on a joint statement on the
                    anniversary of Simla. I shouldn't say later; it must have been before. In the
                    summer of 1982 they collaborated on a joint statement on the anniversary of
                    Simla. That was a particular period of close coordination of the policies
                    between the two ambassadors. It seems to me, in fact, that they each gave
                    lectures at the other's defense colleges, so that Harry Barnes went over and
                    lectured in Quetta and Ron Spiers came over and lectured at the National Defence
                    College.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there are some times when political ambassadors make good sense,
                    particularly if they're well connected, but in a case like this, to have two
                    professionals, they're less likely to have their egos on the line and get, you
                    know, caught up as being overly friendly to the country. They're more likely to
                    see things in a little more objective sense. Would you say that, or is that a
                    fair statement?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think so, and of course Harry had served in the area before and served
                    in India before and knew Hindi, had ways of doing things that people hadn't
                    thought of. At one point there was an American singer of south Indian classical
                    music, and Harry had him give a concert at Roosevelt House and went through the
                    government of India book and invited everybody with a south Indian name. And
                    people came to that who had not been to the American ambassador's house ever
                    before or for years, and wouldn't have come under any other circumstances. So it
                    was brilliant.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It really was. And I think he had a kind of a relationship there that was
                    extremely useful. I can't say that his relationship... You should talk to him
                    about his relationship with Mrs. Gandhi, but he did have a good relationship
                    with Mrs. Gandhi's advisors, the foreign minister, the foreign secretary, other
                    secretary and minister level people around the government.</p>

                    back in India '88 to '91, but yes, we did at that point see that the Congress
                    Party was winding down, in the sense that it had lost its monopoly, and Mrs.
                    Gandhi's way of running the party was killing it by over-centralization,
                    over-control, that the life was going out of the party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it wasn't just her; it was her family, because she had been in, she
                    had been out, she had come back - she had come back with the help of her son,
                    Sanjay Gandhi, her younger son, who had died in a plane crash before I got there
                    in '82, as I recall. And then she was promoting Rajiv, who... You know, the joke
                    that went around Delhi was that Sanjay was a good politician but a bad pilot,
                    and Rajiv was a good pilot but... He was very personable, however, and he
                    certainly, in certain situations, could put things across very well. Sanjay was
                    probably part of the problem in running the Congress Party, and Rajiv was not
                    able to reorganize, revitalize the party to bring it back. It's not clear if
                    anybody can. The problem was that the Congress Party had been built as an
                    independence party, as an umbrella independence party, and that aura continued
                    for many years. They had the benefit until 1964 of Nehru being there, and then
                    for many years Mrs. Gandhi, so it had a continuity of leadership which benefited
                    it tremendously in winning elections, but organizationally it had a very

                <p>Q: Well, then, is there any other issue that you think we should cover on India
                    in this particular '82-84 period? Why don't we stop at this point, and we'll put
                    at the end, you're leaving India in '84, and where are you going?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I actually came back to the State Department to head the Office of
                    Multinational Force and Observer Affairs in the Bureau of Near East and South
                    Asian Affairs, which was the backstop for the Sinai force.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Yes, there had been a long-run issue of American ship visits. This was
                    part of the overall question of having some kind of a contact between our
                    militaries, or contact on military defense issues. And there was a problem with
                    ship visits. The Indian Navy was always very prickly about the U.S. Navy, since
                    1971 in particular, and we had not been able to have ship visits because the
                    Indians had developed a questionnaire that you had to submit on ship visits
                    which asked, “Has the ship called, or will it call, at a port not under the
                    control of a littoral state” or something to that effect. It was a complicated
                    bit of wording which really meant, “Has this ship been to or is it going to
                    Diego Garcia,” which was a base to which the Indians objected considerably. The
                    U.S. Navy policy was never to say where the ship had been or where it was going,
                    and therefore no U.S. naval ships were visiting, even thought we had a fair
                    number of ships that were going through the area that weren't going to Diego
                    Garcia. And we were turning ourselves inside out trying to come up with a
                    formulation that would allow us to have some contact, because this was obviously
                    an important area, and the fact that we had ships that weren't going to Diego
                    Garcia, it seemed we ought to be able to make something of that. And we were
                    wrestling with all of this language. I remember a very long telegram that we did
                    that was convoluted, and Harry took it, and at the very end we added, “Of
                    course, we could always just say no.” And it came back, and the Navy finally
                    accepted that, when we had a ship that wasn't going to Diego Garcia and hadn't
                    been there, we'd just say “No.” And it worked. That was the beginning of some
                    minor contact between our navies, which in fact was beginning to bear fruit when
                    we had the second atomic explosion last year.</p>

                <p>It is June 9, 1999. Okay, Grant, to 1984.</p>
                <p>SMITH: 1984, I returned from India to become director of the Office of
                    Multinational Force and Observer Affairs in the Bureau of Near East and South
                    Asian Affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about where that fit in and what sort of things were you all up
                    to? And then we'll talk about what you did, at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SMITH: This was the force that was created as a result of the Egypt-Israel Peace
                    Agreement, and the concept in the agreement had been that the UN would create a
                    force, just as it had policed the cease-fire agreements between Egypt and Israel
                    over the years, UNEF I and UNEF II, that the final peace would have a UN force.
                    But at that time, the Arabs were very much opposed to the Peace Treaty, and the
                    Soviets supported them, and so this was not something that would fly in the
                    United Nations. We therefore took the lead to create a non-UN multinational
                    peacekeeping force, to help with the implementation of the treaty. However, it's
                    different from some other forces. Partly, of course, the background to it was
                    the Sinai Observer Mission, which had been there before the treaty, which had
                    provided technical early-warning reassurance to the Israelis, which had been a
                    wholly U.S. operation. The force actually consists of two parts. One, which we
                    could call in peacekeeping terms, an interposition force between the two side,
                    which consisted then and still consists, I think, of three battalions - one
                    U.S., one Fijian, and one Colombian (I think it's still a Colombian battalion.)
                    - plus support troops at headquarters, some of which are U.S. Then, in addition
                    to that, that's the other part of the title, there are observers who are
                    responsible for going out and visiting sites in the more distant parts of Sinai.
                    The force is only in one of the zones of Sinai closest to Israel, and there are
                    other zones where there are armament limitations under the treaty, and the
                    observers are responsible for going out and checking in those areas, as well as
                    in the area where the force is, that these armament limitations have not been
                    exceeded. These observers are all Americans. Every team consists of one Foreign
                    Service officer and one retired U.S. military. So in each team you have the
                    combination of the diplomatic and military expertise, which means that we have
                    to have a continuing supply of Foreign Service officers for that. The
                    headquarters of the force is in Rome, with an American director general in
                    charge over all. And then the force commander on the ground, in Sinai, is...
                    Well, when I was there he was a Norwegian two-star general, as I recall, and
                    various nationalities have - I think it's another Scandinavian now. And there
                    are a variety of European and other countries that participate in the force, on
                    the support troop side as well as, of course, the three battalions. It's unique
                    among peacekeeping forces in the sense that it's paid for one-third by the U.S.,
                    one-third by Egypt, and one-third by Israel, which gives the beneficiary
                    countries, if you want to call Egypt and Israel that, a stake in not having too
                    large a force, because usually one or both of the beneficiary countries are
                    going to want the largest force possible. But now since they're paying, that
                    introduces an element of rationality into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it working that way at that time, because it strikes
                        me thawe're paying a hell of a lot of money to Israel and Egypt in aid
                        anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>SMITH: But that's a separate commitment and doesn't go directly for this. If they
                    don't spend it on the force, they can use it for something else. It's fully
                    fungible. No, there was even a case when I was there - I don't remember what the
                    issue was; it had something to do with force size, as I recall - and the
                    Israelis first reaction was, oh, you know, as big as possible, or don't cut, and
                    then they thought about it and looked at the dollars and cents and came back and
                    said, “Well, maybe you could do it this way.” So it did have an effect. And the
                    State Department office was originally much larger, had been responsible for
                    setting up the force, basically, but by the time I got there, it was fully
                    functional. It was on its second director general. The first one, of course, was
                    Ray Hunt, who was assassinated in Rome. The second one was Peter Constable, who
                    went out just as I was moving into the job. And things had become pretty
                    routine, so it was a very small office, and we frankly weren't all that busy.
                    And by the end of the year, I was able to get the office abolished, folded into
                    the regional affairs office, and I took over as head of regional affairs. But
                    during the year I was doing MFO [Multinational Force and Observers], most of
                    what we were doing was... Of course, we had to recruit those Foreign Service
                    officers to go out. We had a fair amount of support and assistance that we were
                    involved in with the Force, both in the administrative sense and also dealing
                    with the Army because the Army was providing services to the force for which
                    they were submitting bills (or should have been submitting bills, but often the
                    amounts were so small that it was difficult to get the army to even submit the
                    bills), so we were in the position of both paying for it but also getting
                    reimbursed for certain things for it. I made a trip out to the Sinai. There's an
                    annual meeting where I represented the United States. And at that annual meeting
                    and subsequently more - it began very gradually - the Egyptians were pushing for
                    the resolution of the Taba dispute.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What dispute was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: This was a small piece that, at the time of the peace treaty, had been
                    left in Israeli hands. There was a tourist hotel there, and there was a question
                    of the final resolution of that. The head of the Egyptian delegation to the
                    annual meeting of the MFO that I attended - I guess it was November of 1984 -
                    was Nabil El-Arabi, who I recall was the legal advisor to the Egyptian foreign
                    minister and had been Egyptian ambassador in New Delhi when I was there, so I
                    knew him personally fairly well. And he pushed very hard for getting this
                    process underway, and it was that effort which, several years later, resulted in
                    the arbitration which Judge Sofer did which successfully resolved the issue. But
                    the beginning of the resolution began there.</p>
                <p>Q: You went out there, I guess, at one point and saw how they were operating.
                    What did they do, particularly the Americans and the FSOs? How did they operate?
                    This was in the '84-85 period.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I assume they're still operating. They had these periodic inspection
                    missions by helicopter to visit sites, locations in the Sinai, to make sure that
                    the Egyptians were not exceeding the force levels and equipment types that were
                    specified in the treaty for that area. And they'd usually go there... It wasn't
                    just flying over and looking down; it was getting off, meeting with the Egyptian
                    officers, sitting and drinking coffee with them, talking about things. There
                    were occasional disputes. I don't remember the details of any of them at this
                    time, but there were occasional disputes about what was going on. And the head
                    of the observer part of the Multinational Force and Observers is a Foreign
                    Service officer, an FSO-1, who is both the head of the observer group and the
                    political advisor to the force commander in the field. So when there are issues,
                    he's the one who takes them and works them with the force commander, who then
                    talks to the Egyptians and the Israelis, or perhaps the chief observer may talk
                    directly to them. There were very few issues going on.</p>
                <p>Q: I was going to say, early on - I've talked to some people who have been
                    involved in this - it was pretty hard work, but I would imagine that by this
                    time there weren't sort of the challenges, the pushes, the maneuverings, almost
                    the macho business, particularly... Apparently the Israelis were early on always
                    wanting to see how far they could go and all that.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SMITH: There were some issues. As I said, I don't remember the details of them at
                    this point, but there were some issues about what was where and what it was. And
                    of course we were involved. If it was a question of treaty interpretation, since
                    we had provided the good offices for negotiating the treaty, our records of the
                    people who were sitting in those meetings were very important, and I can
                    remember one time going back to, I think it was, Jock Covey, who pulled out a
                    stenographic notebook and just went through his notes from a meeting to find out
                    exactly how that issue had been handled in the negotiations, and that was
                    important. I don't remember what the issue was, but I remember that was quite
                    important to be able to go back and get that record of the negotiations. So you
                    had the observers - we provided the observers - we provided a neutral
                    negotiating record from our side, which was very important. And as I said, there
                    were some issues on the Egyptian side when I was there, and as I recall - I
                    don't remember if it was when I was there or just before I was there - on the
                    Israeli side there was a question, too. It had to do on the Israeli side with a
                    mortar that was larger than the size permitted in the treaty, because the
                    treaty, unlike the cease-fire agreements... You may remember that the issue - we
                    may have discussed this earlier - in 1967, when Nasser demanded the withdrawal
                    of UNEF I and the UN picked up and left. Of course at that point, the force was
                    only on the Egyptian side. That's the way the agreement had been drawn up. In
                    the case of the peace treaty and the Sinai force, there's a narrow strip on the
                    Israeli side that is here there is a limitation on Israeli armaments, so it
                    isn't just on the Egyptian side, and the Israelis had, I think, put a 120 mm
                    mortar, brought it into that area where they weren't supposed to - something
                    like that. It may have been mortar mounted on an APC. There was that kind of
                    issue that would come up. And the role of the Force was important, because each
                    side was ready to assume the worst of the other, and the ability of the Force to
                    verify exactly what the situation was and to get a resolve was extremely
                    important. The confidence building - and this was the period of the “Cold Peace”
                    - was a very important factor.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, was there at the time you were doing this and in one guise or another
                    dealing with this, from '84 to when?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Just for a year, really, because in 1985 I became director of the Office
                    of Regional Affairs, which coincidentally with that... No, because it became the
                    Office of Regional and Multinational Force and Observer Affairs when I put the
                    two offices together, and we had one expert who had been in the Office of
                    Multinational Forces and Observer Affairs from the beginning, an outstanding
                    liaison officer with the U.S. army, a civil service employee. He moved over to
                    the Office of Regional Affairs then and took that whole portfolio with him. But
                    in fact I didn't do that much in the Office of Regional Affairs. For one thing,
                    there wasn't that much left to do, and for another thing, 1985 was the year of
                    the hijackings, and I was only director of the Office of Regional Affairs for
                    several months, and during that time I was very, very heavily occupied with the
                    task forces on the TWA 847 hijacking, the Achille Lauro hijacking, and the Egypt
                    Air hijacking, which took most of my time when I was there in the chair at the
                    Office of Regional Affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Q: Well, just before we leave the peacekeeping side, by this time, was this sort
                    of almost a dead issue on both sides? I mean, we were there to make sure it
                    didn't get out of control, but was there any perceived threat by either the
                    Egyptians or the Israelis, of the other side wanting to do something?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember much in that way, although remember, this was only five
                    years after the treaty, so memories were still fresh, and there were elements on
                    both sides which... To begin with, the military always assumes the worst case,
                    plus there were elements on each side which were arguing that these were the
                    intentions of the other side. But you're right - it wasn't that much of an
                    active issue. On the other hand, history was still so fresh that you couldn't
                    think of withdrawing or reducing the size of the force. Now today, here we are
                    15 years later, and it's still there. I was just talking to somebody about it
                    recently, and apparently the U.S. Army is saying that in the Sinai we have
                    service troops doing things which today in today's army are done by contractors.
                    But that was not an issue at that time. And it raises a very interesting
                    problem, because of course to have contractors come in and do it would mean that
                    the expense for the MFO would be much greater and the two sides would have to
                    pay a portion of that expense.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, at the time when most of us served in the military, we had kitchen
                    police duty, and the cooks were military and all that. A lot of that has been
                    contracted out on most bases.</p>
                <p>SMITH: And that's the case in the Sinai, too. Even then that was all contracted
                    out, but now in the military a lot of the logistics is being done by
                    contractors, and that's the kind of thing the U.S. Army would like to have
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you were still in Near East Asian
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right, but I move over to the Office of Regional Affairs in the summer of
                    1985. I don't remember the month, but it was just before the first of the
                    hijackings, but it was just before the TWA 847 hijacking.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember them as intruding very much. Q: That's probably the
                    answer.</p>
                <p>SMITH: But I was only in the Office of Regional Affairs for about four or five
                    months, because in November of 1985 I'd literally moved across the hall and
                    became country director for India, because the India country director had gone
                    off to be DCM in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you were saying you were dealing with
                        hijackings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the hijackings were that caused
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there were two major ones and a third that was also quite
                    significant and took time, but not quite as much from our standpoint. First of
                    all, there was the TWA 847 hijacking, which was TWA's Flight 847 out of Cairo,
                    which was hijacked and hopscotched all over the Middle East, back and forth
                    between Algiers and Beirut. It ended up - I don't remember all the details - a
                    very complicated negotiation with the passengers finally released but a couple
                    of the passengers were killed. I think there still may be court cases pending on
                    that. It was a very high-profile, long event. It was the basis of movies later
                    on, this whole thing, and lots of interesting vignettes. But this meant, of
                    course, we had a task force in the Operations Center, and the Operations Center
                    by then had these whole areas set aside for task forces. It wasn't as it was in
                    the case of the 1967 Israel War, where it was sort of a little room with a
                    telephone next to the main Op Center. By then whole task force areas had been
                    created, and in some cases some of the task forces we in fact took over two of
                    the rooms. We had one for the main task force and another one for the consular
                    part of the task force because there were significant consular issues involved.
                    There were occasions when I was on one and my wife was on the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say on the TWA hijacking, were we considering the use of
                        outroops at all to go in, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, we very much wanted to have that option available. There were press
                    reports which, I think, affected the situation. At one point one of the networks
                    broadcast that Delta Force was being readied or on the way, I don't remember
                    which. And I think that that may have affected the situation. The plane was in
                    Algiers once or twice, and of course that was a location where something might
                    have been possible. It was very hard to imagine doing anything in Beirut by
                    then. And as I recall, there were negotiations with the Algerians about either
                    bringing in some advisors on how to deal with this or bringing in a force to do
                    something. And I think the movie has the force arriving and the plane getting
                    away just as the force arrives. It's always a difficult issue because our main
                    view on this kind of thing is that the responsibility lies first of all with the
                    government where this takes place, where it's physically located. In the case of
                    Algeria, you did have a government. In the case of Lebanon, it was a little bit
                    harder to imagine the Lebanese doing anything about it. And our first policy is
                    always to emphasize it's their responsibility to offer assistance and try to
                    carry that on to do something ourselves if necessary.</p>
                <p>One of the other things that I remember learning in this - it was thfirst time I
                    had participated in a task force in the CNN era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CNN being the international news network.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. And the world watched CNN all the time, and I already mentioned how
                    this mention of Delta on the networks affected things. But CNN was very helpful
                    also, because it was able to do some things that we weren't, and often had
                    fast-breaking news, so it was on all the time. And when the sequence was that
                    the plane ultimately was taken to Beirut, and the hostages were taken off the
                    plane, and then there were long negotiations, and finally the hostages were to
                    be turned over to the Red Cross and transported to Syria, where we would receive
                    them. And CNN was there as the Red Cross was calling the role in Beirut, and we
                    learned by watching that that three hostages were missing not only that, but who
                    they were. There were the families watching, so CNN really played a role in that
                    situation that for me was brand new. Since then there's a lot more, but that was
                    my first exposure to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the three passengers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: As I recall, we said, hey, wait a minute - the deal's off if they aren't
                    all there. And then they later showed up, so the group was complete. I served as
                    the head of the task force on a lot of shifts, and running the task force was
                    quite a job of building a team, you know, keeping records, making sure that
                    everybody knew what was going on. And since the groups were inter-agency, you
                    always had to deal to make sure that everybody was on the same wavelength and
                    you didn't have groups that were going off on your own, like the FBI, which of
                    course wanted to send its own people out and arrest everybody and bring them
                    back to the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Q: What about in earlier cases, you had problems I can think of with Nixon and
                    Kissinger who sort of got caught up almost in the politics of the thing of
                    trying to sound tough. You know, the political element sometimes says we won't
                    deal with people - of course we always deal with people. Was there any problem
                    at this time of people, either politicians or others, getting off the range as
                    far as-</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember that. By then, of course, our terrorism policy was fairly
                    well fixed, and everybody knew it. We don't negotiate with terrorists, but you
                    do keep the lines of communication open with them. The terrorist cannot get the
                    idea that he will benefit from his actions. That was the underlying thesis. Of
                    course the office director of counter terrorism was there on the task force as
                    well. They're very small, so they couldn't provide as many personnel as NEA
                    could. As I recall, Bob Oakley was the director at the time. The one thing that
                    happened, not in the case of the TWA 847 hijacking, but in the case of the
                    Achille Lauro hijacking, which sort of gets at what you are talking about, the
                    Achille Lauro - I forget all the details - ended up in Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Achille Lauro was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Achille Lauro was an Italian cruise ship which was hijacked in the
                    Mediterranean - I don't remember exactly where it was going from or to at that
                    point - and at least one American was killed, Klinghoffer, in a wheelchair, and
                    was killed and thrown overboard. It was sailing around. I can remember at one
                    point calling up our DCM in Nicosia and saying in the middle of the night and
                    telling him that it was headed his way and getting a resounding, Oh, S - - t ! A
                    lot of the time we weren't quite sure where it was going, but it ended up in
                    Cairo with the passengers released and the Egyptians taking charge of - custody
                    may be wrong word - taking charge of the hijackers. And of course we put a
                    tremendous amount of pressure on the Egyptians to either indict and try them
                    there or turn them over to us. And I can remember at one point coming into the
                    task force and finding April Glaspie on the phone with... Of course, these were
                    all open lines. Although we could make classified calls, almost all the business
                    was done on open lines because we didn't have “stews” a the time. It was much
                    more complicated. And April Glaspie was on the open line talking to the
                    ambassador or the DCM in Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nick Veliotes and Bob... I can't remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think it was Nick Veliotes... And just criticizing the Egyptians up one
                    side and down the other, very carefully, very carefully, very slowly, very clear
                    English. But the Egyptians ultimately let the hijackers, or at least the lead
                    one or several of them, leave on a flight, which we forced down -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Sigonella, in Sicily.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: At Sigonella, in Sicily. And that was an Oliver North operation, and it
                    was done without full coordination with the Italians. I assume you have tapes.
                    I've talked to people who were in Rome at the time who tell that side of the
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but can you tell your side of the story?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, we on the task force sort of had fuzzy information about what was
                    going on because, of course, Ollie North was over there in the White House doing
                    his thing, and first thing we knew, it had happened. The plane was on the
                    ground, and the U.S. troops had surrounded it, and the Italians had surrounded
                    the U.S. troops, as I recall, so you had quite a bit of a standoff, and a long
                    period of negotiation, and then we went through exactly the same kind of thing
                    with the Italians that we'd gone through with the Egyptians, and unsuccessfully,
                    because the Italians released or allowed the chief hijacker to leave. And he
                    left to Yugoslavia, where he disappeared. And again, I can remember calling up
                    the DCM there in the middle of the night and getting a similar reaction when the
                    chief hijacker had fled there. That was an example, though, of the White House
                    grabbing the ball and doing something not fully coordinated that caused some
                    trouble. And from what I hear, the problem was that the ambassador in Rome did
                    not have an instruction to tell the Italians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Maxwell Rabb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, and Len Baldyga, who was PAO there at the time, later told me that he
                    had strongly urged the ambassador to go tell the Italians, and either he hadn't
                    gotten it done in time or didn't feel that he had instructions. Anyway, it
                    didn't happen right. And that was an example of something that happened, in
                    forcing down the plane, and did not achieve its objectives because the chief
                    hijacker was ultimately released.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They were improving. We were working very hard on improving relations with
                    India at that point. A lot of it was a follow-on to the efforts that had begun
                    when I was there '82-84, when Harry Barnes had opened this door of tech transfer
                    and military relations, and that was something that took a huge amount of our
                    time. We had also worked... We had been very concerned about the problem of the
                    Kalistan in India, the group of Sikhs who were demanding independence for the
                    Punjab but unlike some situations did not appear to have the support of the
                    overwhelming group of the population, that these were... They were involved in
                    terrorism, I think. They'd killed Mrs. Gandhi. There were plots to kill some
                    people here in the United States, and just before I took over, as I recall, we'd
                    successfully put some of them in jail in the United States. We'd turned some
                    others over to the Indians. So we had some real cooperation there on this
                    issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I think that's right. I don't remember all the details. We were
                    working very closely with the Indians there, and the cooperation was good. The
                    Indians had put somebody in their embassy in Washington from their Intelligence
                    Bureau in addition to the people that they'd always had from their... Their
                    Intelligence Bureau is their internal intelligence operation. They have what
                    they call their Research and Analysis Wing, which is their external. So by that
                    time in Washington in their embassy they had both their external intelligence
                    people plus this person from the Intelligence Bureau who was specifically tasked
                    for cooperation on these issue.</p>

                <p>SMITH: No, we have a Sikh population in the United States. In fact, the Sikh

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SMITH: We were concerned about the ties of some of the Sikhs in the United States
                    with this group, and as I said - again, I don't remember all the details, but
                    there was at least one court case in Louisiana, where we put some of them in
                    jail for and attempt on the life of a visiting Indian minister or provincial
                    minister, I forget which, and had cooperated with him on other cases. I can
                    remember testifying on a deportation case, and getting... During that
                    deportation case there was a death threat. I don't think it was against me. As I
                    recall it was against the judge, but there were threats as a result.</p>
                <p>Q: Did this spill over at all into the two other things that I can think of in
                    India. One is the Kashmir thing. Did that affect you at all during this
                    particular time?</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SMITH: Kashmir was fairly quiet during this period. The current round of problems
                    in Kashmir... Remember that in 1971, India and Pakistan signed the Simla
                    Agreement, which ended the 1971 War and committed them to resolving problems
                    bilaterally. And after that, you had about 18 years when Kashmir was fairly
                    quiet. Things were going on in the state, but as an issue between India and
                    Pakistan it was fairly quiet. It was not given much publicity in the Pakistan
                    press in that period, much less than it had been in the '60s, and the change
                    came about in '88-89, as a result of things that happened within the state, but
                    during this period of '85-88 it was really quite quiet. There were problems
                    between India and Pakistan, and there was a period in 1987 when there was a
                    crisis between the two called the “Brass Tacks Crisis.” Brass Tacks was the name
                    of an exercise that the Indian Army was doing in the desert, the desert being
                    near the Pakistan border. I think it was the largest exercise that they'd ever
                    done. The Pakistanis saw this exercise, the massing of troops for this exercise
                    as a threat in itself, and you had the beginning of a buildup, a mobilization on
                    either side. It began to remind us of 1914. And this is actually in the public
                    domain. There was a conference on this at the Stimson Center sort of in the
                    '91-93 era, but there was a problem of this buildup. There was a problem of a
                    very hard-nosed Indian Army chief of staff, who may have - in fact he was making
                    a point by doing this. There was a problem of poor intelligence on each side. At
                    one point during the exercise (and everybody knows this case; I was just
                    discussing it last week), the Pakistanis in reaction to the exercise either took
                    one of their armored divisions out of garrison or it didn't return to garrison
                    when it was supposed to - I forget which - and the Indians didn't know where
                    that division was. And they thought it was at a point which was very threatening
                    near the Indian border. In fact, it wasn't there. It was back farther,
                    protecting various axes of potential entrance. But you had the Indians thinking
                    it was over here and reacting to that, so that the Pakistanis were reacting to
                    the Indian exercise and the Indians are reacting to what they see as this
                    Pakistani division moving to a place where it wasn't. We at the time - and I had
                    an opportunity to go back and review the files on this some years later - were
                    very low-key in our response. Herb Haggerty was the Pakistan country director. I
                    was the Indian country director. We both had a good deal of confidence in the
                    two sides' ability to manage this situation, because you don't have small
                    governments there without a history of rational thinking, without structure,
                    without procedures. All of this you had there, certainly on the Indian side,
                    very democratic. Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister, and we were pretty confident
                    that this was something that the two sides could manage themselves. So the U.S.
                    public statements were very low key. We later learned that things in India were
                    not quite as well managed as we though they were. In Pakistan, yes, they were
                    fairly well managed, as I recall. Zia was still president there, and they were
                    fairly well managed, but on the Indian side Rajiv was operating with a bit of a
                    kitchen cabinet, not coordinating fully within his own government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's one of these things where somebody in NEA is saying,
                        “Well,this is one we can keep our hands off this one?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I'd have to go back and review the record. I had the impression hat
                    NEA was preoccupied with other things. The deputy assistant secretary, and I'm
                    not sure he was there all the time, was Robert Peck, and he was very much
                    involved in Afghanistan, which of course was hot at that time. The principal
                    deputy assistant secretary was Arnie Raphel, who did sign off on many of these
                    things, but Herb and I pretty much did it ourselves. It was unlike the case in
                    1980, when you had the Gates Mission go out and everything. In this case, we
                    were very low key. We did send messages, and we did go so far as to try and deal
                    with the problem that India thought that the Pakistan division was where it
                    wasn't. We didn't tell the Indians where it was, but we did tell them that it
                    wasn't where they thought it was. So to the extent that we could influence the
                    situation based on our own intelligence sources - national technical means, I
                    think, is the correct term -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're really talking about overhead satellite -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right, and so we were able to influence the situation. We couldn't
                    provide them with pictures, but we could provide them with some oral statements
                    that were somewhat reassuring. I think we heard from them at this conference
                    that was held to look at this crisis that that did help defuse things, some of
                    our statements, but we did that by messages out to our ambassadors - not by
                    special missions - using the ambassadors on the ground. We had John Gunther Dean
                    in New Delhi and Dean Hinton in Islamabad, two of the grand old men of American
                    diplomacy, so it was handled, as I said, at a much lower level; and ultimately
                    they talked to each other, and a military delegation came over from Pakistan,
                    and they negotiated a phase-down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you and your colleagues at all concerned about the
                        Indiagovernment not being quite as professional as it might be at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, we weren't. We didn't understand what was going on, and we only
                    learned later what was going on and learned - I personally when I was there and
                    then at this conference later heard - some of what was going on. This was a
                    period when we were very taken with Rajiv Gandhi, who was very engaging and said
                    the right things. But it was only, I think, later on that we began to realize
                    that not only do you have to have somebody who says the right things, but he has
                    to have control and he has to be able to accomplish things, be able to pull
                    people together to do things. And Rajiv didn't always do that as well. He did
                    tend to work through something of a kitchen cabinet, and that's the kind of
                    thing that can cause problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the other problem that I would think
                        you'd bconcerned with, Sri Lanka and the Singhalese and all that? Was
                        that-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SMITH: That was very active during the period, and I don't remember all the
                    details of what was going on. The big thing that I remember was the
                    Rajiv-Jayawardene agreement, which I think again was in 1987, which we got a lot
                    of criticism on, I personally got criticism on, because the U.S. government
                    strongly supported that agreement. This was an agreement which provided for a
                    framework for the solution of the problem, and we assumed that the Indians,
                    particularly Rajiv Gandhi- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>It had become clear by then that India, beginning under his mother, had training
                    camps for Tamil militants in southern India and had very close ties. And there
                    were a number of groups - I don't remember the details now of which groups - but
                    it was closer to some than to others. But we assumed that Rajiv wouldn't sign
                    this agreement, which as I recall provided for a way that the Tamils would get a
                    fair amount of autonomy within Sri Lanka, unless he had the militants on board.
                    As it turned out, he didn't, and of course India then sent in troops to try and
                    deal with this, and with disaster, often referred to as India's Vietnam because
                    the Tamil militants... Particularly the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) was and is an group
                    that seemed unwilling and unable to compromise. Some of us thought that as it
                    went on this was one of those militant groups that have been fighting for so
                    long and of a particular kind of background that it really doesn't know anything
                    else and doesn't have any other thing to do than to fight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like the IRA, some of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Some of the parts of the IRA, I guess, are like that. And again, we
                    thought that the Indians had made a deal, and they hadn't. Again, it may have
                    been an example of poor coordination within the Indian government. I don't know.
                    Actually, before the agreement, there was a situation where we were criticized
                    because the Sri Lankans had surrounded Jaffna or cut Jaffna off, blockaded it,
                    and it was running short of food - or at least the impression was that it was
                    running short of food - and the Indian Red Cross tried to deliver food across
                    the strait and was prevented by the Sri Lankan navy, and the Indians then did an
                    air drop of food. And the Sri Lankans were very critical. But our position was
                    rather nuanced that, yes, this was a bad thing, but on the other hand, there
                    were human lives at stake here and humanitarian supplies were needed, because we
                    were critical of the Sri Lankans for having stopped the Red Cross because we had
                    the impression that this was a clean Red Cross operation. It was not an ICRC,
                    but my recollection is that it was a fairly clean Red Cross operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean by “clean” that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It only had food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Food, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was an honest humanitarian effort. So in the case of Sri Lanka, the Sri
                    Lankans were very unhappy with our position, which was based, again, on a
                    misperception of what the Indians had done or their ability to sell the
                    agreement to the Tamil militants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at this thing in East-West conflict? Did
                        thaenter into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, it was not East-West. It was very much the kind of problem that you
                    encounter today as you look at other parts of the world, that you had an
                    ethnically, religiously, and linguistically separate group after independence
                    within a country, and we were saying there ought to be a way that this can be
                    handled within Sri Lanka. We were critical of both sides and trying to see a way
                    out.</p>
                <p>Q: This is an example of what is termed “conflict resolution.” How were the
                    Indian government and the Sri Lankan government responding to this? Butt out, or
                    trying to get us on their side, or how were they doing?</p>
                <p>SMITH: We weren't in a heavy-handed way trying to resolve this for them. We were
                    giving them advice and commenting but not in an intrusive way. We were not
                    providing major military assistance to the Sri Lankan government, and our
                    attitude towards the Tigers later changed, but at that point, we certainly saw
                    that the Sri Lankan government had a long ways to go in the sense of providing
                    some sort of local autonomy, and my recollection is that the agreement went in
                    that direction and seemed like a good thing, because this seemed to be the only
                    way that it could be resolved within the context of Sri Lankan sovereignty.</p>
                <p>Q: Did we feel while this was going on that the Sri Lankan government was being
                    overly Sinhalese oriented, sort of dumping on the Tamils?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, I think that that has been a perception of the Sinhalese government
                    ever since 1956, when J. W. R. D. Bandaranaike won on the basis of a Sinhala
                    only campaign and started the separate language tracks of schools and things
                    like that. The government at that time was not from his party - it was the old
                    UNP - but it had certainly affected Sri Lankan politics, and it was very hard
                    for any Sinhalese politician to move out of that.</p>
                <p>Q: What about Mrs. Gandhi and then by extension her son Rajiv, training Tamils?
                    Was this for the local politics - I mean inside-Indian politics, or was this an
                    aggression, or how was this going?</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SMITH: The Indians, first of all, do have something of a Monroe Doctrine kind of
                    approach to their area, that they think that they ought to be able to take the
                    lead in resolving problems within the area. They were concerned about the Sri
                    Lankan Tamils, although the Sri Lankan Tamils had been in Sri Lanka for hundreds
                    of years. This is a very separate issues: there is a small group - not small
                    group, a group - of Indian Tamils within Sri Lanka also, who were taken as
                    estate laborers, for whom India has much more direct concerns. But the Sri
                    Lankan Tamils have been there for hundreds of years, but they also have real
                    ties across the strait with the Tamils in southern India. So yes, it was India's
                    approach to its role in the region plus the factor of Tamil politics, because as
                    the Congress Party has over the years lost its dominant tradition in Indian
                    politics, it has become more reliant on coalitions with some of the state
                    parties. And in the State of Tamil Nadu, there are two - now, anyway, and as I
                    recall they were prominent by then - state parties, which were feuding with each
                    other but very assertively pro-Tamil. And the Congress party had decreased
                    significantly in influence in the state of Tamil Nadu, of the DMK and the
                    AIADMK, both of which have factored in recent problems, political problems in
                    New Delhi.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your take on Indian politics in this period, particularly as far as
                    what we were concerned with? Were there any issues? I mean, we've talked about
                    the conflicts, but how about trade or intellectual rights or support or what
                    have you?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the big issue, which I alluded to at the beginning, between India
                    and the United States had to do with our willingness to approve the sale to
                    India of various high-tech items for military use or for non-military use. One
                    of the big issues was supercomputers, where we had agreed to sell a
                    supercomputer to India and we were working on the details, a supercomputer for
                    medium-range weather forecast, and that sale ultimately did go through. There
                    was a question of a sale of a second one. I don't remember all of them, but
                    there were a lot of individual technology transfer cases - night-vision goggles.
                    There was a complicated effort underway by Northrop to sell the jet that they'd
                    sold overseas - the F-5.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SMITH: Right. Northrop wanted to sell the F-5 line to India so India could use
                    that as the basis for producing its own light combat aircraft. The Indians had
                    been designing a light combat aircraft, and this seemed like a good marriage,
                    but the Indians only wanted it if they could get various high-tech add-ons -
                    like composite technology and things like that. A tremendous bout of
                    negotiations. There had been an MOU [Memorandum of Understanding] on technology
                    transfer negotiated just before I took over, and a lot of our work was focused
                    on implementation of that. Many negotiating sessions with the Indians in
                    Washington and New Delhi, many individual issues. There were complicated motives
                    on both sides. The Indian scientists very much wanted this high-tech stuff. The
                    Indians, I think, saw that they could offer this and set up a relationship with
                    us based on this that would be something new - and in fact, they were right.
                    This would be a very different kind of relationship from the kind of
                    relationship we had with Pakistan, where we, of course, had just been selling
                    them military equipment. We could have more of an economic-based,
                    production-based type of agreement with India that would have a more long-term,
                    fundamental nature to it - and again, not just in the military, because there
                    were other things we were talking about, computers being the biggest one. And
                    from our standpoint, it was an opportunity, again, to have a different kind of
                    relationship and undercut the whole Indian relationship with the Soviets. The
                    Indian relationship with the Soviets had been sort of based on three elements:
                    the political support, particularly in the Security Council vis-�-vis Kashmir;
                    the military assistance, or sales, I should say; and economic assistance - well,
                    economic assistance had never been very important. And this was a way to get at
                    the military side, by helping the Indians build their own military things rather
                    than just buying the assembly rights from the Soviets. And I must say that this
                    occupied a huge amount of our time. It's a little bit hard for me to remember
                    exactly what happened when because, of course, I went from this job to DCM in
                    Delhi, where the same issues continued.</p>
                <p>Q: Were the Indians monitoring what was happening in Afghanistan, both the fact
                    that we were giving advanced equipment to the Mujahideen and what the Soviets
                    were doing? I mean, was this just seen as a plus thing for them, as far as
                    giving Pakistan trouble - or how was this viewed?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, India has always interpreted many things in light of the
                    India-Pakistan equation. And while India was unhappy about the Soviet invasion
                    of Afghanistan - or at least some Indians were unhappy, because there were,
                    again, differences there - openly unhappy, as the Reagan Administration came in
                    and we began renewing our military assistance relationship with Pakistan, the
                    Indians focused on that rather than on Afghanistan, and their general line was,
                    “You've got this problem of Afghanistan, so you're selling high-tech F-16s to
                    Pakistan? What's the relationship between F-16s to Pakistan and this
                    counter-insurgency war that's going on in Afghanistan?” Their focus was very
                    much on Pakistan.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SMITH: It certainly wasn't on mine, and I don't remember it being on Indians'. I
                    personally remember going to something in 1990 and meeting a college roommate of
                    mine who was a correspondent in Moscow, had been three times in Moscow as a
                    correspondent, and he told me that the Soviet Union was coming apart, and I
                    didn't believe him. So I certainly didn't perceive it, and I don't think the
                    Indians perceived it as happening, and if they had, and as they were later, they
                    would have been unhappy, because of course this was in some ways removing,
                    further undermining those pillars of support.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: We've talked about this before, but at this time, was there still sort of the
                    almost innate hostility or suspicion of the United States that, one, we were
                    uncouth barbarians and, two, whatever we did was wrong?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, certainly the huge sale, or the new military assistance to Pakistan,
                    had revived this point of view in India, yes. So from that standpoint it was a
                    difficult period, although the tech transfer relationship was something that,
                    with parts of the Indian government and also our position on Kalistan, was
                    helping to offset that, although for Indians, as I think for most foreigners,
                    understanding the U.S. political system is very difficult. And when you add a
                    member of Congress who is openly supporting Kalistan-</p>

                <p>SMITH: Dan Burton - or when you had-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes... Well, no, actually, I don't think he does. There were others with a
                    Sikh community. I don't think he does. I think it was more ideological. But then
                    you had leading political figures - I think it was Bush - being photographed
                    with Kalistan leaders occasionally. They would somehow pop up in a picture with
                    him. Although the Indian government knew that we actually were cooperating quite
                    closely on this, I'm not sure that that was the public perception.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work with the Indian embassy and how effective
                        woulyou say it was? We're talking about this '85-88 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We worked quite closely with the Indian embassy. I think we had good
                    relationships with all sides, all elements, in the Indian embassy. The Indian
                    embassy - and I don't know what the current situation is - but historically, by
                    then, had always been a little bit prickly about level of access and meetings.
                    So the ambassador would only meet with assistant secretary and above, and the
                    DCM only wanted to meet with a deputy assistant secretary or above, which meant
                    for me, as a country director, how do I have access to the DCM, who really
                    should be my main interlocutor. We worked things out by quietly going off and
                    having lunch periodically. Sometimes he'd buy lunch and sometimes I'd buy lunch.
                    That got around that problem entirely, and I think we had a very good working
                    relationship, with almost all levels of the Indian embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they understand the American political system? Some
                        embassies really think that what you really have to do is deal with the
                        Department of State, when really you certainly have Congress and you have
                        the media and sometimes the White House to deal with, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: As I recall, my impression was that the Indians had over the years tried
                    various approaches and none of them had succeeded. They tried focusing on
                    Congress; they tried working with the media. The Indians at this time did not
                    have a lobbyist. It was only some years later, I believe, that they finally
                    hired a lobbyist. We encouraged them, said that they really needed that kind of
                    an operation, whether they hired a lobbyist or... You know, some countries
                    effectively do it through an organization of American citizens of the origin of
                    that country. But there were several organizations of Indians in America, but
                    they were very much focused on immigration issues and they really weren't very
                    involved with the policy issues between the two countries. So I think they
                    certainly understood how complex the situation was; on the other hand, they
                    hadn't figured out how to work it. Some of the smaller countries were doing a
                    better job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, some countries seem to take to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Sri Lankan ambassador was very effective in this period, as the
                    ambassador of a small country. The Nepalese ambassador - I'm not sure whether it
                    was in this period or after this or before this - I remember had figured out how
                    to work the system to get an invitation for the king to come to the United
                    States, working through one of the secretaries in the White House, as I recall.
                    But these were people who managed to work the system. The Indians weren't doing
                    as well, particularly on the PR and lobbying side. They could have used some
                    professional help, but they really had an aversion to hiring a lobbyist.</p>

                <p>SMITH: I think I mentioned that when I was there with Harry Barnes we resolved a

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, intellectual property rights I'm sure was an issue in this period,
                    but it was more of an issue in the later period when I was in New Delhi. I must
                    admit that I have a little bit of trouble remembering which was which, since one
                    blends into the other, but this is a major problem for the Indians, still,
                    although the creation of WTO [World Trade Organization] provides, I believe, a
                    framework for resolving it. The big issue with the Indians is whether they grant
                    patents for items or for processes. And they are only granting process patents,
                    not patents for items - chemical - and it was basically a problem with chemical
                    and pharmaceutical patents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they basically wanted to produce their one, and it
                        is a bicost. And it's something we deal with all over.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>SMITH: Right, and I was a little bit ambivalent about it, in the sense that India
                    does have a situation where basic medicines are available at reasonable cost,
                    unlike Africa, where somebody may have to pay a month's salary for a series of
                    shots of penicillin, where in India, basic medicine was really quite widely
                    available and quite reasonable in price. On the other hand, because of this
                    policy, the more advanced, more modern medicines were not available at all
                    because pharmaceutical companies would not bring them in. So you had a situation
                    which was good from some standpoints - in fact, if you took the
                    “most-good-for-the-most-people,” may have been the preferable situation, but
                    also was a real problem. Our approach was to talk to the Indians about their
                    interest, to try and persuade them that it was in their interest to change in
                    this respect and to cite, of course, the example of the Indian position on
                    copyright and how they dealt with piracy on CD's and software and things like
                    that, where their position was quite good - films - because they a stake,
                    because the Indian film industry, of course, is the largest in the world,
                    produces something like an average of two films a day, I think was the figure.
                    So their laws and regulations there were quite good because they saw themselves
                    as having a stake in that. On the other hand, in the case of the pharmaceutical
                    and chemical industries (I think those were the main two that were affected),
                    they didn't yet see that they had a stake in it. At least my approach to it was
                    to try to persuade them that if they wanted to convert to world-class industries
                    here with domestic R &amp; D, they needed to come up with a better patent
                    machine. And certainly towards the end of the time I was DCM there, we were
                    beginning to make some progress there. We'd occasionally even get some of their
                    pharmaceutical manufacturers to recognize that. Also we had, I can remember an
                    American pharmaceutical manufacturer telling me that the U.S. firms could
                    compete even without the patent protection because the Indian firms did such a
                    poor job of selling and providing product information, whereas the American
                    firms in India, as in the United States, had representatives who were going
                    around to doctors with information, really explaining and pushing the product.
                    The Indian firms never did that, so the American firms had tremendous brand
                    recognition, which the Indians didn't have, and could maintain significant
                    market share through that alone. So I thought we were making progress, but
                    ultimately this has been resolved in the context of WTO, which is much easier
                    for the Indians.</p>
                <p>Q: That's the World Trade Organization, which is just established, really. It
                    took over from the GATT and was just established in the last few years.</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right, but that provided what would have been a bilateral issue, I
                    assume (I haven't been associated with it since '91), ultimately became rolled
                    into the multilateral WTO negotiations and was resolved in that context.</p>

                    Jack Hubbard for eleven months; and then Bill Clark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I'd been country director, and I think probably if you look through, run a
                    statistical analysis, you'll find that a fair number of times the country
                    director becomes a DCM in a significant-sized country. And in fact, since I'd
                    been working with John Gunther Dean as country director, it was sort of logical
                    that I'd move on to be DCM.</p>
                <p>Q: How did things work out between you and John Gunther Dean? He was a gentleman
                    who's had about every assignment. He's had many major and very, very difficult
                    assignments, including Cambodia at the time -</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SMITH: I was only there for a couple of months when he was there. I arrived in
                    August, as I recall, and he left in September or October, came back to the
                    States, was here for a month or so, came back and sort of packed out, and left
                    in November - would be my recollection. But there wasn't much overlap in the
                    field, and if you want to talk to someone who was his DCM in the field, you
                    ought to talk to Gordon Streehan, who was my predecessor in Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: He's retired. I believe he's at the Carter Center, alonwith another former
                    DCM there, Craig Creekmore - and Harry Barnes.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, I've tried to get hold of them all to do something. There was some
                    controversy about Dean. You don't want to talk about that. I have talked to John
                    Gunther Dean, and he's obviously very, very bitter about this.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'm trying to do an oral history with him because it's
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I would say that one thing was very clear that I can say very honestly -
                    that he wasn't prepared for and hadn't accepted the idea of retirement. He's
                    somebody who expected to and wanted to continue to be in the traces - something
                    we all have to reflect on - but he obviously took it very hard when Jack
                    Hubbard's appointment was announced. I remember one day in Washington, before I
                    came out, I was talking to Jack Hubbard, and John Gunther Dean came into the
                    office and looked at Jack Hubbard and said, when I introduced him, “I know who
                    you are. You're the one who wants my job.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Jack Hubbard, or who is Jack Hubbard - at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Jack Hubbard had been in the AID mission in India in the 1960s, as I
                    recall. He's an educator. He had, as I recall, helped set up the agricultural
                    universities. He had come back. His most recent incarnation before coming to
                    India as ambassador had been as president of USC [University of Southern
                    California].</p>
                <p>Q: So a major figure.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>SMITH: A major figure - major figure in southern California, and obviously knew
                    the republican leadership, the Reagan leadership from southern California. But
                    he had been to India, back and forth to India, maintained ties there. He was
                    involved with the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Education and Culture. He was a
                    member of that, so he continued an association with India and was certainly very
                    happy to come back, but didn't have much background in diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1988, when you arrived in India - how would you state
                        ourelations were with India at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, as I said when we were doing the last segment, I have some trouble
                    differentiating exactly what happened when, because I went from country director
                    to DCM, and remembering exactly what the situation was. But this was a period
                    when we were strengthening our relations with India. I think some people saw the
                    whole period as trying to “wean India away from the Soviets,” some people would
                    say. I think a better way to describe it would be that India was beginning - and
                    much more was done later - economic liberalization, which was sort of unleashing
                    the Indian economic and entrepreneurial abilities so we were building a
                    relationship in this period looking to the future, trying to have a relationship
                    with India and have a relationship with Pakistan that was not determined by our
                    relationship with the other. And in the case of India it had a lot to do with
                    high-tech, the beginnings of some work with India on high-tech in the military
                    area - not assistance, but sales - and a broadening and deepening of our
                    relationship in general during this period. This was a time, when I arrived
                    there in '88, of a Congress government, and it was Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the prime minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Rajiv Gandhi at that time. Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in '84. Rajiv was
                    elected. He was prime minister when I arrived in '88. I think we still saw Rajiv
                    Gandhi and Benazir in Pakistan as providing opportunity for these two countries
                    to get on to a new generation, a new era. It turned out it didn't work that way.
                    Both of them were probably better politicians than they were leaders, but that
                    was our view at the time. We'd had the Aditi exhibit here in 1985, as I recall.
                    He'd come for that. He came to the United States again in 1987, arrived on the
                    day, “Black Monday,” when the stock market fell so much? That was the day he
                    arrived on one of his visits. So there was certainly a better relationship, but
                    as always in India, there are people who are very suspicious of the United
                    States, who remember the past, who are looking for any reason to get at us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, you were country director, so you
                        werintimately involved -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>SMITH: Not only that, I had been political counselor until '84. had been
                    political counselor, country director, and back as DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to think of yourself as an Indian
                        hand,somehow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, actually, for my own career it probably would have been better to go
                    somewhere else, not to be so closely associated with India, and I think that
                    some people in Delhi, in the embassy, felt that there was micro-management of
                    the Political Section coming from the front office, which was sort of hard to
                    get away from because I knew the issues pretty well.</p>
                <p>Q: But when you arrived there, being on the ground, did you sense any difference
                    in sort of the attitude of the embassy and how things were going that what you
                    had when you were political counselor or working from the Desk?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course, I'd been out there a couple of time when I was on the
                    Desk. I think that I did sense a better relationship. I'm not sure I can say a
                    better relationship than was there in '82-84, but certainly a different
                    relationship from what was there in the '70s when I'd been there. And there had
                    been a gradual improvement, and there was the beginning of this economic
                    liberalization. I can remember fairly soon after I arrived I spoke at a
                    conference sponsored probably by the Chamber of Commerce on economic issues, and
                    one of the other speakers was Abid Hussein, who had been a member or chairman of
                    the planning commission and was later Indian ambassador here in the United
                    States, and quite a proponent of liberalization. And he told me afterwards...
                    Well, first of all, he spoke, and I still remember what he said, talking about
                    liberalization. He said, “We have to open the windows. A few flies will come in,
                    but we need the fresh air.” And afterwards he came up to me, and he said, “Well,
                    what you said was very good, but you really aren't enthusiastic enough.” So you
                    had the beginnings of this liberalization, which of course really took off in
                    the '90s, and as a result there had been quite a change in India's international
                    economic situation. If you look at India's reserves right now, it's in the
                    billions of dollars. They're very comfortable, whereas in the '80s and certainly
                    before that it was very close. It was a much dicier thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you're talking about liberalization, we're
                        realltalking about opening up markets and people coming in -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you're talking both about that and about opening up the domestic
                    economy, because India had had an economy that was built by Nehru and the other
                    leaders who had been educated at the London School of Economics, Fabian
                    socialist influenced, very statist, many state corporation, many controls. The
                    basic philosophy was that the government would license factories to produce
                    x-number of refrigerators, and that would be all. Therefore, the economic
                    competition in the country was to get the license. And you can imagine a lot of
                    pressure and money exchanged hands in trying to get the license, but once you
                    got the license you were home free. You didn't have to provide service or
                    quality or anything, because this was all controlled, with the government
                    deciding how many refrigerators should be produced. And they were beginning to
                    liberalize this. In the late '80s or early '90s you saw the beginning of this.
                    Bajaj, which is the maker of motor scooters, maybe the largest in the world, but
                    you find their motor scooters in Southeast Asia, many places. They suddenly had
                    to set up a marketing department, for the first time. And this was going on in
                    other industries. The industrialists had to begin to worry about quality and
                    service for the first time. You had young entrepreneurs coming up. You began to
                    have young entrepreneurs coming back from the United States, who'd been here as
                    engineers, scientists, setting up companies in India. You began to have... I saw
                    it in the times when I was there, this having been the third or fourth time that
                    I was there. When I was in India, back in the '50s and the Indian era in the
                    '60s, every college student's main ambition was to become a member of the Indian
                    administrative service or the Indian Foreign Service. That was the best thing to
                    do. By the time I was there, in the early '80s, the objective was probably to
                    join a large Indian company. But by the last time I was there, this last time,
                    it was to start up a company, and I actually saw this going on and talking to
                    students.</p>
                <p>Q: I've never served in India, but I have pictures of it because at one point I
                    served in Dhahran and I used to go over to Bahrain and see sort of the Indian
                    Civil Service type thing working there, and I'd think of huge offices full of
                    overhead fans or something and piled high with papers stitched together -</p>
                <p>SMITH: The term “red tape” was invented there.</p>
                <p>Q: -I mean, paper, paper, paper, and this was mostly civil servants who were
                    doing these things. You're talking about one very big rice bowl that's getting
                    broken, as far as government control over these things. Were you seeing this as
                    a sort of a major battle within the Indian-</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SMITH: It was a major battle, and actually, the person who started undoing it was
                    one of the people who put the controls in place. I think I may have mentioned
                    that before - L. K. Jah. But yes, there was a major conflict, and you would see
                    it in Indian bureaucrats trying to retain control. You'd also see it in the
                    state corporations, and you would hear them arguing, “Well, we can do it as well
                    as anybody else.” And the area where I think liberalization has been most
                    difficult in India has been getting rid of those state corporations,
                    particularly the ones that are money-losing operations. And this is not just
                    India; it's been true in Latin America and other places around the world, one of
                    the most difficult things to do. But in India, you always did have a private
                    sector; there was never just a state sector. For instance, in steel, there was
                    government steel, but there was also private steel, and I think what 's happened
                    recently is that you've had increasing willingness of the government to allow
                    the private part of that to expand, and in many areas - computers being an
                    example - the private sector is dominant, not the government. There may be some
                    government corporations in there - I'm not sure whether there still are - but
                    the private sector is dominant. During the same period you had the first linkup
                    between Texas Instruments - getting permission to put a satellite dish into
                    Bangalore and to begin using Indian programmers in India, rather than having
                    them- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>So you had the beginnings of the Indian software in this period. And of course
                    now they're a dominant factor or a very important factor in international
                    software.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the embassy crank up to be quite aggressive in promotion of American
                    investment there but American sales there with this opportunity, or did we...
                    How did we work this, or was this really something that we said, “Here it is,
                    fellows, come on in,” and to the private sector?</p>
                <p>SMITH: In most case, the American companies which were coming in, were coming in
                    with an Indian partner. We were aggressive in some areas, where there was a case
                    of government contracts - not always successfully. We were very aggressive...
                    One of the biggest issues there, which was only been resolved and not completely
                    resolved up to now, was intellectual property rights, and this was an area where
                    we were, I think, tough and aggressive. It basically involves pharmaceuticals
                    and some chemicals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about computer type things? That hadn't come
                        yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Indians, on copyright, are okay, because the Indians are the world's
                    largest producer of films, and they make something over 700 a year - two a day -
                    and they realized very early that copyright protection was very much in their
                    interests. And as I recall they quickly extended it to computer things as well.
                    So copyright was not particularly and issue. What was an issue was this
                    pharmaceuticals.</p>
                <p>Q: Was that a philosophical difference? I know in some places the feeling is if
                    this medicine protects people, and you charge big money for it, you are cheating
                    humanity, really.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>SMITH: It is a philosophical difference, and the Indians would make several
                    arguments. We may have discussed some of this on the last tape, but one of the
                    arguments was the one you made - that the Indians saw it important to have basic
                    medicines widely available at a reasonable price. Now this is something that I'm
                    sort of sympathetic about because serving in Francophone Africa, a shot of
                    penicillin there when I was there was one month's salary for a lot of people,
                    whereas in India, basic pharmaceuticals actually are quite reasonable. Another
                    India argument was basically the “infant industry” argument: that they need this
                    to get going, and other countries, including the United States, had only
                    introduced product-patent production very late in the game. The issue is
                    product-patent protection versus process-patent protection. The Indians provided
                    process-patent protection but not product-patent protection on pharmaceuticals.
                    However, we argued that it was in the Indians' interest to go into
                    product-patent protection because India itself was getting into the realm - it
                    was developing things - and if it really wanted to have a strong pharmaceutical
                    industry, in addition to having those high-tech more recent pharmaceuticals
                    available in India (which had not been available in India because foreign
                    companies had been unwilling to sell them there because of the patent protection
                    issue, so if you need something that is fairly new, you can't get it in India),
                    but we argued that the Indians should start providing product patent, because
                    then they could develop their own R&amp;D and really develop their
                    pharmaceutical industry, not as a derivative but as a real industry. Of course,
                    this has been resolved through the WTO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World Trade Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. This resolution was not bilateral between the U.S. and India, but
                    multilateral in the WTO sense. I don't think the Indians have quite worked out
                    all the details yet, but this was a major issue during the period I was there.
                    It wasn't just pharmaceuticals; there were a few agricultural chemicals that
                    were also an issue. And some American companies, as a result, just refused to
                    have any dealings with India. FMC was an example, felt very strongly about it.
                    And I couldn't argue with them. So we'd push very hard on this area. We also
                    pushed very hard in trying to get American companies into the high-tech area
                    with the government, particularly with the Indian military. The Indians were
                    trying to develop a new light combat aircraft. Northrop with memoranda of
                    understanding, and Northrop was working with them, with their issues of
                    releasability of particular kinds of technology, composite technology in
                    particular, and how far were we willing to go. And this was an issue with
                    Washington, but it was also an issue in India because, obviously, they were
                    foreign competitors here. But the big American companies, like Enron was
                    beginning its work then, and others, often didn't need any particular American
                    help. They were well established. A number of American companies had very good
                    joint ventures there - Cummings Diesel, for example, has a longstanding
                    agreement with a very fine Indian company, as I recall. Some American companies
                    have very good arrangements with Tata. So there are some longstanding joint
                    ventures there that are quite successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Q: Well, did you find at least at the ministerial level and all there was a
                    tendency to try to get the companies to deal more with the European Union or
                    something, I mean just a natural reaction against the United States?</p>
                <p>SMITH: To some extent. Again, I think we touched on a little bit of this last
                    time. But the Indians don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, so when it
                    comes to buying aircraft or having licensing agreements in sensitive areas,
                    they're going to want to deal with the Europeans and with the U.S., not
                    separately. In some areas, the Europeans had a definite advantage because of
                    their more lax laws and regulations on bribery. Our law on this is quite
                    unique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's getting more universal, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In fact, there were some major scandals in India over alleged bribe
                    payments, and one of my arguments with the Indian government used to be, “Gee,
                    if you bought from the United States, you can be pretty sure that there haven't
                    been any bribes because you know that an American company that bribes is going
                    to get taken to court in the United States; whereas in France, French companies
                    can deduct those - they're tax- deductible - not only they're legal, they're
                    tax-deductible.” But just as we had some longstanding arrangements, obviously
                    some European companies had longstanding arrangements in certain areas, plus,
                    some of the Indian leaders, coming from... By then it was many years after
                    Independence, 40 years after Independence, but you still had some leaders who
                    had been educated in the UK and had a more European background. It varied from
                    individual minister to individual minister, and of course the government changed
                    several times when I was there, so we were dealing with different ministers on
                    different occasions.</p>
                <p>Q: By this time, the whole political spectrum - we've mentioned it before - it
                    really was a democracy, wasn't it? I mean, with all its warts and all that.
                    There were genuine elections.</p>
                <p>SMITH: In India there are genuine elections, and if you judge the success of a
                    former colony in the field of democracy by its ability to change government
                    twice - not just once, but twice - India actually passed that, has more than
                    passed that test, and while we were there that time, it changed several times.
                    In fact, in this period, you saw the first Congress Party defeat - the big
                    defeat was in 1977 - and there had been a gradual erosion of Congress Party
                    power, and beginning by 1989, you saw the beginning of coalition governments,
                    which is what you've had continuously since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Political Section was able, had
                        goocontacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you'd always like them to have better contacts, buyes, I think that
                    they had good contacts.</p>
                <p>Q: It's a hard country to cover, isn't it, because of both the geography, and
                    some of the parties are so ethnically or religiously oriented, or whatever you
                    want to call it? Does that make a difference? That makes it more difficult to
                    sort of understand.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Perhaps. People are generally fairly accessible. There isn't a problem...
                    The problem is more of manpower to do all of this than accessibility. We had, of
                    course, if you went back to the '60s, we had had a larger political section. We
                    had had political officers in all of our consulates. By this time I don't think
                    we had political officers in any of our consulates left. Our consulate in Bombay
                    was a consul general, and there was one political-economic officer, as I recall,
                    and then basically consular. And Madras was similar. So we had very little
                    political work being done in the consulates, except by the consuls general
                    themselves.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Ministry of External Affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, certainly, there were people of that kind there, and I had personal
                    relationships with a lot of people in the Foreign Ministry going back for by
                    then more than 15 years, which gave me an ability to call people up and do
                    business on the phone, which I always consider the indicator of efficiency in
                    dealing with the Foreign Ministry, the ability to be able to call up and do your
                    business on the phone. And yes, I was to that point with a lot of people -
                    again, personal relationships going back a long time with some of them. But yes,
                    there were people like that who were in the Foreign Ministry and are still
                    active there.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm talking really about a visceral dislike of the United States and its
                    policy, not of Americans. This '88-91 period is very interesting because the
                    death-knell of the Soviet Union came about in this time. It didn't cease until
                    '92, but the Wall came down in '89 and all this happened. How did this affect
                    the Indians? How were they watching, because the Soviet Union had been their
                    partner?</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think that you really ought to ask the person who was there next,
                    because I think the impact became much more evident after '91 or late in '91.
                    Clearly the relationship with the Soviet Union had been important for India. It
                    had been important, I would say, in three different areas. One was the Soviets'
                    political support in the Security Council; secondly was the military supply
                    relationship to the Soviet Union; and third was economic. Well, the economic
                    relationship was not important by then. The military supply relationship
                    continued, but the Indians had always wanted to manufacture themselves whenever
                    they could, and of course, that was an opportunity for us to have a relationship
                    that would be different from the traditional relationship we've had with
                    developing countries where we've sold them end-items. In the case oIndia, this
                    was an opportunity to have... And when I talked about “weaning them away” from
                    the Soviets, you could do that by developing a relationship with them, helping
                    them make their own military equipment so they wouldn't buy from the Soviets.
                    And actually, that was much preferred on their part, so this was something they
                    were already doing, and I think that as a result, the military part of the
                    relationship with the Soviets had already become less important. But I think
                    psychologically the breakup of the Soviet Union was important for them, and I
                    think they can still count on Russia in the Security Council, probably, for the
                    veto on Kashmir issues if necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Indian Communist Party? Was that
                        important?Where did that stand during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the Indian Communist Party, of course, had split, and there were two
                    Communist Party, or more, depending on how you counted, but two main Communist
                    Party - the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India Marxist.
                    That split had occurred in the early 1960s and was a well-established split. The
                    Communists participated in governments or, in one case, ran the government in
                    various parts of India. It was very interesting to watch the Marxists, the CPIM,
                    which was not allied with the Soviet Union, became the government in West
                    Bengal. I don't remember exactly what year it was the government, but it was the
                    government during this period. And they were obviously being corrupted by being
                    in government, because suddenly they were getting interested in foreign
                    investment and efficiency of government and various other things that we would
                    say would be good. And of course, the CPIM and politicians in West Bengal in
                    general, you often find if you look at the politicians that they are
                    London-trained barristers; and that was true in the case of some of the CPIM
                    also, I believe. The CPI, the pro-Moscow Communists, could always be relied on
                    to be very critical of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have much contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>SMITH: Oh, we used to go see them, talk to them. I can remember one time - and
                    again, I don't remember whether this was in '84 or '88-89, I went around and
                    called on the head of the CPIM. In fact, he was a historic figure. He'd been
                    blowing up trains in India in the 1940s - you know, a real historic figure - and
                    we sort of heard indirectly from their intelligence people that a few weeks
                    later he said, “What was Grant Smith going over to CPIM headquarters for?” I'd
                    done it very openly, intentionally, because he was a fascinating person to talk
                    to. And when they had the government in West Bengal, our consul general in West
                    Bengal talked to them. In fact, we had quite an interest in maintaining a
                    dialogue with them. The CPI was a little bit more difficult, but yes, we talked
                    to them.</p>
                <p>Q: We've talked before about it, but during this time, the Tamil business, in
                    dealing with sort of the ethnic groups in India in this period?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, you had had by now the Congress Party was weak in all of the south,
                    and you had state parties in leadership positions or coalition leadership
                    positions in all of the states of the south. And in some of the states you'd
                    have two state parties vying, Tamil Nadu being an example. But this was true in
                    all of the states of the south, that the state-based, linguistically-based
                    parties had become very significant. And that's part of the change in India
                    that's taken place - the decline of the Congress Party, the increasing strength
                    of these state-based parties in the south, the increase of the strength of
                    really caste-based parties in the north. So it's quite different from the
                    post-Independence period, when Congress was totally dominant. And there has been
                    a steady erosion of Congress power.</p>
                <p>Q: Sort of an overall question - we were helping militarily, and of course
                    there's always the Pakistan-Indian issue, but was there any concern on our part
                    about a movement for a greater India? I mean, India was always talking about
                    exerting its influence in the Indian Ocean and all. Were we concerned, looking
                    down the pike, India might become a real problem to us in Southeast Asia or
                    South Asia?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't think the U.S. government as a whole was, but when you asked
                    questions like that, you often had to ask, well, who is we and who is they? I
                    think the U.S. Navy may have been somewhat concerned, and certainly perhaps
                    groups in India were more active in these areas than others. However, in the
                    last interview, we talked about India and Sri Lanka, and I don't remember all
                    the details or the dates, but India had brokered this agreement in 1987, which
                    we though could lead to an end of the Sri Lanka problem. In fact, it led to an
                    Indian intervention in Sri Lanka, and Indian military force in Sri Lanka.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I don't remember whether it was late '87 or in '88. I don't remember the
                    exact time, but what happened was that they got very badly burned. Sri Lanka was
                    India's Vietnam, many people say. And you could talk to Indian officers coming
                    back from Sri Lanka who were really in a state of shock - as we might have found
                    some coming back from Vietnam - over going up to little old ladies who would
                    blow up and blow them up, suicide bombers. So they went into Sri Lanka, they
                    brokered the agreement thinking that... Rajiv was very full of himself, thinking
                    that he could persuade the militants to abide by this agreement. That didn't
                    work, and they went in with their military force to deal with the militants, and
                    that didn't work either. And then they ultimately withdrew. That was, in a
                    sense, they were probably less likely to try this kind of adventure in the
                    future, even if they were building up their naval forces and their ability. And
                    they do talk about force projection ability. But after Sri Lanka, the incentive
                    for this kind of thing was somewhat less in India, I think.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, no, no. Their focus is Pakistan, China, the immediate area -
                    Afghanistan - because this was the period where you had the Soviet withdrawal
                    from Afghanistan, the fighting between the factions, the fall of Najib, and the
                    fighting between the factions. Actually, there were differences of opinion
                    within the Indian government about what was going to happen in Afghanistan, one
                    group saying Najib would survive, another group saying he wouldn't survive. Of
                    course they saw Afghanistan through the Pakistan prism, not through the Russian
                    prism, as we did. The events that involved us with India that you may have heard
                    - if you've interviewed Bill Clark, you've probably heard about this-</p>

                <p>SMITH: - the Iran-Iraq War and the Indian position on the Iran-Iraq War, because
                    for one thing, governments changed in India during this period so it made it
                    very complicated, but India had a relationship with Iraq, as part of the
                    nonaligned relationship. It had an economic and possibly some military
                    relationship with Iraq - I forget the details. It had a large Indian community
                    in the Gulf, so it had a concern there, an involvement. I remember that shortly
                    after the invasion of Kuwait and before Desert Storm, the Indian foreign
                    minister went off to Iraq and made some statements that were pretty bad as far
                    as we were concerned. But in fact, when we went to them to try and move some
                    supplies thorough India, some flights thorough India, we did get permission, and
                    we were able to move a fair amount through India. So their position was - and it
                    varied depending on which government was in power, as I said, governments change
                    - but we were able to get their cooperation to a fair extent on transiting
                    supplies, landing in India and going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: When it was on - this would be January, February, March, I guess, of '91 -
                    were the Indians as transfixed as other countries were by watching this war on
                    TV and all?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, the Gulf War was the entry of CNN into India. CNN really didn't have
                    much of a foothold before that, but just as everywhere else the Gulf War was a
                    tremendous boost in CNN popularity, so in India. It really was an important step
                    to getting CNN established and getting, I think, satellite systems in general
                    established in India. A lot of people were watching it. It had quite an
                    impact.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting any reflections from the Indian military on this, because
                    we're really beginning to talk about a whole different way of waging war, with
                    smart weapons, and it was showing that, you know, the old how many tanks you
                    have is more important than the type of munitions you have, and all.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>SMITH: The Indian military were quite interested in the war, yes, and I can
                    remember a seminar after the war when some of the Indians semi-governmental
                    strategy community, which historically had been very critical of the United
                    States over Pakistan, actually was fairly supportive of the United States over
                    the Iraq War. This may have had something to do with religious elements.
                    Pakistan's position on it... and military admiration, I think. After all, the
                    army is the key military power in India, the senior service, and they were very
                    admiring of the work of the U.S.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We weren't, and I don't remember the details right now. India's
                    relationship with Iran, again, is a factor of the India-Pakistan equation, and I
                    don't remember at what stage it was at that point. I remember more about it
                    right now because, with Iran supporting the anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan,
                    Pakistan supporting the Taliban forces, India is in the anti-Taliban camp and
                    therefore has a common interest with Iran.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think in the last interview we discussed the 1987 crisis, the “Brass
                    Tacks Crisis.” There was another crisis in late 1989 or early '90 - I think it
                    was early '90 - when the two sides had escalated. I don't remember the details
                    of the escalation right now - I'd have to go back and review it - but I remember
                    that we did send out Gates, who was then national security adviser... or
                    CIA?</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Gates. We had a senior high-level delegation, which we hadn't sent in
                    1987, we did send on this occasion, to talk to both sides. And I don't remember
                    that it needed that much calming down, but his mission certainly reassured
                    us.</p>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>SMITH: The issue in which the U.S. was involved by now was the nuclear issue.
                    There are always - and I don't remember the details - questions of whether we
                    would sell a little bit of this or a little bit of that to Pakistan. But the key
                    issue for this period was the nuclear issue and the question of U.S.
                    certification. And of course we finally decided, in 1989, 1990, that we could
                    not certify under the Prescott Amendment, and all U.S. assistance to Pakistan
                    ended. The Indians sort of said, “Well, you should have done that a lot sooner.
                    You didn't do that because of Afghanistan. It's about time. You let the
                    Pakistanis get this far. You should have done more.” But that was the main
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Now, of course, something else was happening that is now significant but at the
                    time was not a factor between us and India and Pakistan. That was Kashmir. It
                    was Kashmir, which had really become fairly quiet, and I can remember an
                    American academic telling me - I think this was in 1988 - that there really
                    wasn't much coverage in the Pakistani press of Kashmir. They didn't seem very
                    interested in it. Of course, in 1989, you had the beginnings of what has been
                    the problem in Kashmir for the last 10 years, which was for the first time an
                    internal insurgency, because before, all of the problems had been really
                    provoked from Pakistan. But this one, unlike the others, was an internal
                    uprising, which the Pakistanis later took advantage of; but initially - a senior
                    Indian official, I remember, I think then foreign secretary, saying to me, “This
                    is 10 percent Pakistan and 90 percent India's doing,” because India had done a
                    very bad job of dealing with Kashmir within it's own internal political
                    situation. I mean, it was-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Heavy hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>SMITH: A heavy hand, overturning governments, fixing elections, things like that.
                    And the revolt in 1989 was the product of that bad handling by the Indian
                    leadership. Mrs. Gandhi had had a lot to do with it back in her time, and it
                    continued under successive governments. And I'd been there in 1982; I'd seen
                    Farooq Abdullah, when he took over right after the death of Sheikh Abdullah, and
                    everybody thought Farooq Abdullah was great. He drove his own Land Rover around,
                    and people would come out in the streets to wave and cheer. So he had everything
                    going for him, and they just screwed it up. They could have done a much better
                    job. You had other factors at play there also, because you had Phillips Talbot,
                    who was assistant secretary the 1960s, who had written his doctoral dissertation
                    about Kashmir and went back 40 years later, '87 or '88, before the problems
                    arose, and went back to the same village in the valley. And he commented that
                    the two things that he noticed were, first of all, the increase in
                    communications, just as you saw this other places, that what had been a very
                    isolated village, even though it was in the valley, was tied in to the rest of
                    the world and the rest of Kashmir; also the tremendous increase in the sense of
                    being Muslim. Exactly why that had happened - we knew that the Iraqis and the
                    Iranians had been training Mullahs who could have had an impact. But clearly,
                    the bad Indian administration, bad handling, was a major factor here. So you had
                    the riots in Kashmir, which Pakistan later took advantage of, and which has led
                    to the current situation today, where suddenly Kashmir is back on the agenda,
                    both between India and Pakistan and internationally, to some extent. And while
                    we aren't mediating, we have more of a role than we have had for years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: By this time... Of course, 1984 you had had the attack on the Golden
                    Temple, and by the late '80s, early '90s, the Indians were containing the
                    situation. Punjab was not quiet, but it was quieter. It was becoming quiet, and
                    it has since become much quieter. You could go up to Punjab. My wife, who was in
                    the Consular Section, an American Citizen Services officer went up to Punjab on
                    American citizen service and visa fraud cases, although one time she was up
                    there and she had expected to be able to go back to Delhi, but she couldn't get
                    back and she asked the district commissioner where she should stay, and he said,
                    “We can put you put you up here, but we're not sure about your bodyguard.” And
                    she said, “What bodyguard? I don't have any bodyguard,” because people up there
                    were still traveling with bodyguards. So it was better, but not yet good. Unlike
                    Kashmir, though, Punjab had never had the widespread local support that you had
                    for the riots in Kashmir. That was never there in Punjab, so it was much easier
                    for the government to deal with. And in Punjab, the origin of the problem there,
                    and I guess in many ways the solution to the problem there has been that there
                    are many factions among the Sikhs, and it was playing on those factions that led
                    to the problem, and they could also be manipulated to help solve the
                    problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: At very short notice. In some ways it's a lot easier to do a
                    vice-presidential visit on 48 hours' notice rather than on four months' notice.
                    You have to do everything quickly, and you do.</p>
                <p>Q: You do it. How was this taken? I mean, how did we see this? Did we see this as
                    a major disaster, or just another thing in developments internally in India?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it was a disaster, certainly. Probably you have to go back to that
                    whole involvement in Sri Lanka to see why it happened, and the Indians had been
                    involved in training the Tamil militants back before 1984. They had run training
                    camps, so as was the case in Punjab, the government had something to do with the
                    beginning of the problem. But then it had tried subsequently to try to fix the
                    problem and not succeeded. And this was one of the militants or people connected
                    with the militants who was retaliating against Rajiv. I'd have to go back and
                    review things very carefully. I think that we were somewhat less enchanted with
                    Rajiv at that point than we had been before, although after he lost the
                    elections in 1989, we had had two brief coalition governments, and we were
                    certainly interested in seeing a more secure, longer-term government, which a
                    Congress victory in that election, as it turned out, ensured. They had a
                    longer-term government after that. Some of the victory, of course, was a result
                    of Rajiv's death.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you still have the feeling that India was pretty low in the concern... You
                    know, great things were happening. Not only was the Soviet Union beginning to
                    fall apart - particularly the Eastern Bloc - but we had the Gulf War and all.
                    And I assume that India, then as had been the case, as you mentioned before, was
                    not very high up on our list of priorities as a government.</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think that's correct. We had a lot of other things on our plate, and for
                    certain Indians particularly had always been people who were nice to hate. They
                    had provided us some support during the Gulf War but had not been a coalition
                    partner.</p>

                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>SMITH: That was never in the cards. The most we could hope for, I think, was to
                    have them take a strong independent position and let us transit. We did get some
                    of what we wanted. We got some transit, and we occasionally got a strong
                    position, but not as much as we wanted. Again, it depended, because you had
                    different governments in power during that period and different positions with
                    the different governments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: No, he did not have any following; however, there were some terrorist
                    concerns as a result of the war, and we dealt with that by allowing voluntary
                    departure. I forget whether it was just before or during the Gulf War. I think
                    it was just before. It was very interesting because the offering of voluntary
                    departure reduced friction or concerns within the American community, with the
                    official American community, and I was personally very involved. I was actually
                    charg� in the period just going up to the war because the ambassador was away,
                    and I was very involved in dealing with the official community - town meetings
                    and this kind of thing where you could see that going to them and saying, “Yes,
                    there are security concerns, and any wives, or dependents, and nonessential
                    personnel that want to can go back to the United States now.” And only a handful
                    - I think only four or so - took it, but it very much reduced the level of
                    concern within the official community.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there were real concerns at the time that there were going to be Iraqi
                    commando teams going all over the world, which was not a figment of imagination.
                    Apparently we had some real problems, concerns, in the Philippines and other
                    places.</p>
                <p>SMITH: We had some information that there might be something in India, and of
                    course, I was living in what had been Chester Bowles's house, not the one that
                    later ambassadors lived in, Roosevelt House, which is on the compound and very
                    secure. I was living in the old ambassadorial house, a wonderful old
                    pre-Independence bungalow - with a low wall.</p>
                <p>Q: By the time you left in '91, the Gulf War was over and the Soviets were really
                    fading from the scene. Was there a new India emerging - from our point of view -
                    as a world power, a minor one it might be?</p>
                <p>SMITH: I think, on the economic side, as I said, we- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I was saying that by 1991, and much more so after I left, you saw the effect of
                    economic liberalization on India's position as an independent country, certainly
                    improving.</p>
                <p>Q: What about China during this '88-91? Was China a factor from America's point
                    of view, from your embassy's point of view? Was there concern?</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>SMITH: Of course, China, like the United States, in India - there was both
                    bilateral relationship and a relationship with Pakistan, and China's
                    relationship with India was very much affected by China's relationship with
                    Pakistan. And I think that we as a country also, looking at China and South
                    Asia, would look in part at that Chinese relationship with Pakistan. There
                    certainly have been press reports of Chinese involvement in the Pakistani
                    nuclear weapons program, and that has been an issue between us an China, both
                    the Pakistani nuclear weapons and the Pakistani nuclear program, Chinese
                    involvement. So that is an issue for us and the Indians, very definitely. On the
                    other and, in a strictly bilateral sense, China and India - and I don't remember
                    exactly what year what happened - have gradually improved their relationship,
                    have instituted confidence-building measures along their borders, have not moved
                    to any kind of formal settlement, which for political reasons would be difficult
                    in India and probably in China also, but have a much more secure de facto border
                    between them. Now, at this point, they have communications between the
                    commanders on either side and regular meetings and this sort of thing, so it is
                    a much more stable situation on the ground, which has been happening gradually
                    through the years. Some of it happened in small steps during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the nuclear issue in India during this period?
                        Was thiquiescent, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>SMITH: There was an issue for us. It was certainly a factor, both the nuclear
                    issue and the missile issue, in this whole question of how far we would go with
                    them on high tech. We were watching their test site in the Rajasthan desert very
                    closely and concerned that they might test again. We were very concerned about
                    their missile programs, crossover between their satellite and space-launch
                    programs and their military missile programs - and of course connection of that
                    to nuclear programs. The U.S. was involved with the initial Indian satellites.
                    Ford Aerospace built them, so there was an involvement. The U.S. was involved
                    with the initial Indian nuclear program. We helped them to build a nuclear power
                    reactor, outside of Bombay, which last thing I knew was still operating, the
                    only one of that generation of power reactors in the world, built by
                    Westinghouse, that was still operating anywhere. All the other ones had been
                    long since retired. Issues within the U.S. government on whether we should
                    cooperate with them on nuclear reactor safety or not, whether we could legally
                    and whether we should from a policy sense, because one could argue that even if
                    you aren't going to cooperate with them any other place you should cooperate
                    with them in this area. If your company built the damned thing, it's the only
                    one left in the world, and it's very old by world standards, you should be
                    willing to let our experts talk to their experts on this. I recall at one point
                    - it may have been the '85-87 period - there was a plan to let Germany sell some
                    spare parts from their decommissioned reactor of the same period to them. There
                    were periodic reports that the Indians... There was a problem with pump seals,
                    and they didn't have the right pump seals so they had to replace them more
                    frequently than normal, which meant sending people in. A person might have to go
                    in and then another person might have to go in because of the exposure in the
                    amount of time that you could go in. I always thought that there was a good
                    argument that this was an area where we should cooperate with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '91, what came about? Was there anything else that we
                        shoulcover, do you think, in India, of any other issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>SMITH: No, I think I've mentioned the governments which were changing while I was
                    there and Rajiv Gandhi was defeated by a coalition headed by V. P. Singh, and
                    then that fell and we had Chandrasekar in charge. And then you had the return of
                    the Congress government. But I guess one of the things that I learned in that
                    period, and I think others learned also, was that in India, certainly, you
                    really couldn't judge a leader by how he'd been before he became a leader,
                    because V. P. Singh, we had seen - and this is my personal view - as a young
                    leader. He'd always been very impressive - we selected him for an IVB program
                    back in the early '70s, as I recall - and we thought was a leader who said the
                    right things, and he seemed to be a consensus builder. When he became prime
                    minister, it just didn't work. Chandrasekar, on the other hand, had always been
                    somebody who was breaking up coalitions, a spoiler. He became prime minister,
                    and he was actually quite a good leader, and from our standpoint also we saw
                    this on questions involving overflights and access, flights going to the Gulf
                    War. Chandrasekar was the one who was willing to do the necessary, take the
                    risk. And it was very interesting to watch that happening. And again, I learned
                    a lesson that how somebody has been before he becomes prime minister may not be
                    a good indicator of how he's going to do as prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did the ambassador who succeeded Dean last only about
                        1months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's a good question. His name had been submitted by the Reagan
                    Administration. It had not been cleared with the Bush people, and he was not
                    confirmed in the closing days of 1988. I don't remember the details of why he
                    wasn't confirmed - whether it was something about him or some package - but
                    there wasn't anything major about him that I remember. He was not confirmed, and
                    the Reagan Administration gave him an interim appointment, and the Bush
                    Administration did not resubmit his name. So he had a maximum of 12 months under
                    the law. I suspect that the Senate, if it had not confirmed him initially, it
                    would probably be even less inclined to do so after he'd been as an interim
                    appointee, because they don't like interim appointments. So the Bush
                    Administration named Bill Clark to replace him. As I recall, he arrived in early
                    December of 1988 and left in November of 1989, and Bill Clark arrived a few
                    weeks after that.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Right.</p>

                <p>SMITH: He'd been basically offered what he wanted, and he asked for India. That's
                    my understanding of it. But he certainly brought a lot of large-mission
                    management background to Delhi and was very clear-sighted about some things that
                    were good ideas, like selling off property we didn't need.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '91, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In 1991, I came back to be principal deputy assistant secretary in the
                    Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, under Mel Levitsky. I'd served with
                    Mel in the Office of UN Political Affairs in 1980-82, and he needed a deputy; I
                    was available, so he asked me to come back to be his principal deputy in
                    international narcotics matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '91 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was there from '91 until '94. However, from '91 to the end of '93, I was
                    principal deputy assistant secretary. Then in early '94, I sort of moved over.
                    Somebody else became principal deputy assistant secretary, and I was working
                    more on setting up the new crime function, because INM, which originally had
                    been the Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, became the Bureau of
                    International Narcotics and Law Enforcement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It became known as “Thugs and Drugs.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it had always been called that informally, but it became that
                    formally. And I helped set up the law-enforcement side of it. There was a
                    position that was vacant, and I helped set up that part of it as a deputy
                    assistant secretary and went off to the UN Crime Commission a couple of
                    times.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's talk about the '91-93 period when you're sort of the war on
                    international narcotics. What were you bringing to it, and how did you see our
                    operation working at that time?</p>
                <p>SMITH: What was I bringing to it personally?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>SMITH: Actually, I didn't have any particular background in the narcotics field.
                    I did have some limited knowledge of parts of it, particularly the South Asia
                    part; but in the overall scheme of things, South Asia is a small portion of our
                    problem, both as far as heroin production or origin is concerned, and heroin is
                    a small portion of our overall problem, most of which is cocaine. So Latin
                    America looms very large, and that was where I had to focus. In fact, I went on
                    a field trip, within two weeks of arrival, to Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. First
                    day in the field on this job, got to Bogota, overnight in Bogota, and the
                    appointments in the capital weren't available that day. They were for the next
                    day, so they took me out in the field the very first day. We flew to the Amazon
                    side of Columbia to look at coca growing and the counter-narcotics police there.
                    We landed in a town that was real wild west - this was travel by fixed wing and
                    then helicopter - and then the police helicopter went off to look at coca
                    growing, and they saw some coca growing down there in a patch, and we went down
                    and they showed it to me. I hadn't seen coca growing before. I pulled some of it
                    up. They found a processing area adjacent. I don't know if you know, but coca
                    processing involves highly volatile things like ether, and the simplest thing is
                    just toss a match in and it burns, blows it up. And the police did that. And we
                    got back in our helicopters. There were two helicopters; there was one I was in,
                    and there was another one with a police escort. We took of first, and then they
                    took off. As they were taking off, some shots were fired, and the next thing I
                    know there is a machine gun in the door of the Huey next to me going
                    blat-blat-blat-blat down on the ground. And I sort of accused them of setting
                    this up as my introduction to the drug wars. I don't think they did. And of
                    course, since then, at that time, coca growing in Colombia was a relatively
                    minor thing. Colombia was the processing area, but the growing area was Peru and
                    Bolivia. Since then, Colombia has become the major growing area, partly because
                    we've had success in eliminating or reducing the growing in Peru and
                    Bolivia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon this operation? In a way, I guess,
                        the besindicator is the price of cocaine on the street, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>SMITH: The bureaucratic structure which works on this in the United States is
                    very complicated, but I think the overall concept is - correctly so - you have
                    to work on all parts of the picture, and part of the picture is consumption in
                    the United States, and you need efforts to reduce consumption in the United
                    States. Part of it is processing and transit. Part of it is the actual growing.
                    And I guess you could say there is a fourth area, which is the whole
                    money-laundering side of it. But the overall policy is that you need to go after
                    all parts of this. Different administrations have differed about which emphasis
                    goes on which part. The State Department's role here is that it has money for
                    international counter-narcotics programs. It has money for that and is involved
                    in working with other countries in coordinating policies in this area. I think
                    that would be a correct way to put the State Department role. Our programs were
                    much more focused on the cooperating with other countries on the production and
                    processing and transit in those countries. In other words, in the time I was
                    there, we had a program of about $150 million worldwide, and the majority of
                    that was being spent in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, working with authorities
                    there, police and others, to counter growing, processing, and transit within
                    those countries, both programs of incentives for not growing or for growing
                    other crops, alternate crops, and enforcement, working with the
                    counter-narcotics police, establishing, supplying, and then working with the
                    counter-narcotics police in those countries. But we didn't do case things. The
                    DEA obviously did that, and Customs, and other parts of the U.S. law
                    enforcement. We were much more working with these governments on policy and
                    programs and funding those programs.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the coordination? One always thinks of the State Department
                    considering relations with a country, the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) wanting
                    to charge in and do things. And then you've got the American military getting
                    involved. I would think this would be a very difficult coordinating job.</p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a difficult coordinating job in Washington. I can remember just
                    enormous meetings in the Old Executive Office Building - you know, 80 people -
                    because you had many different agencies and you had multiple office within those
                    agencies that were involved in this. So these meetings became very large and
                    unwieldy. There was always a question of who was in charge. We had interagency
                    working groups, and at various points they were chaired by the NSC, by the
                    Office of National Drug Control Policy and by the State Department, to get
                    coordination. And it was very difficult, and very often you had these issues of
                    where should our priorities be, and you also had very complicated funding
                    issues, who was going to pay - this is what needs to be done, well, how are we
                    going to fund that? Our resources were limited and, in fact, reduced in the
                    period I was there. But the military didn't want us to tap into their resources
                    necessarily. Obviously, when you're looking at a program that requires
                    helicopters, one way to do it is to get some old Hueys and send them down to
                    wherever, not take it out of the INM budget. There was always a question for the
                    military, because a lot of what the military was doing was working on the
                    transit zone, on detection and interdiction, and that takes a lot of up-tempo
                    time, and they were reluctant to use up-tempo for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>So coordination in Washington was extremely complicated, plus you then you had
                    coordination in the field. In fact, coordination in the field tends to be
                    relatively easier because at least you have an ambassador who's in charge. But
                    in places in the field, yes, you had the U.S. military, you had our operations,
                    the INM operations, and I think the largest office we had was four officers, but
                    we often had a lot of American contractors in these countries. INM at that time
                    had something like the third or fourth largest air force in Latin America,
                    because we had helicopters, we had spray planes, which is a souped up crop
                    duster with a little bit of armor. It was called a Thrush, developed
                    particularly for this program. I never rode in one. The kept asking me after
                    lunch, and I knew that that was not something that you wanted to do. We had a
                    couple of old transports flying from Lima over into the upper Huallaga Valley,
                    which is where the coca is grown, to a base over there, and these were C-123s
                    with jet-assisted take-off pods on the wings, but you had to go on oxygen over
                    the hump, over the mountains, over the Andes, and I think when INM gave them up,
                    these airplanes went into museums. We had some lighter, twin-Otter type
                    aircraft, so we had an operational aspect to it as well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the different countries, Colombia - during the
                        timyou were dealing with this, what was our view of Colombia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Very mixed. This was a period where there are allegations of major
                    politicians' involvement. Of course, you had the Medell�n and Cali cartels,
                    great efforts to get the Colombia government to, we hoped, extradite them, but
                    at least arrest and prosecute them within Colombia. Fairly good cooperation from
                    the Colombian government with the police on power programs - in other words, not
                    going after specific criminals, which would be more DEA stuff, but the broader,
                    counter-growing kind of programs - but still major transit into Colombia from
                    Peru. That was the time when Colombia was the processing area and it was grown
                    in Peru and Bolivia and transited to Colombia for processing.</p>
                <p>Also during this period, you had the beginnings of opium cultivation in Colombia.
                    The Colombian traffickers are good businessmen. They know that they've got a
                    market. They see another product. They've got the marketing mechanism. They want
                    to put a new product into their marketing mechanism, so they started promoting
                    the growing of opium in Colombia. The Colombians did some experimenting. We had
                    already discovered that roundup was very effective against-</p>

                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>SMITH: The chemical, what you use against poison ivy we had been using very
                    successfully in a number of places, particularly in Guatemala, in spraying
                    opium. The Colombians experimented and discovered it could also be used for
                    spraying coca - this was done during that period - and convinced us. We had not
                    thought that was possible. They convinced us if you did it in the right
                    concentrations it was very effective against coca, so we supported them in
                    spraying against coca as well. But some of the other governments were not
                    willing to spray. The Colombians were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Peru? How did we view them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Peru was very difficult to deal with. I don't remember all the details of
                    this. Tony Quainton was our ambassador at the period. You probably have
                    interviewed Tony. Peru was the major growing country. The major growing area was
                    out in the upper Huallaga Valley. We had a base there, but it was very difficult
                    to maintain, very exposed, and therefore subject to attack. Of course, you had
                    the Sendero luminoso problem, which was rather separate, unlike Colombia, where
                    the insurgents were being funded by taxes on coca growing. I don't think there
                    was that tie, but there was a terrorist problem. We couldn't get permission to
                    spray in Peru. It was not a very satisfactory arrangement. We ultimately closed
                    the base we had built there and tried to conduct similar operations from
                    elsewhere, but we weren't having much success. What later really had some
                    success in Peru was when the Peruvian Air Force began working against those
                    transit flights from Peru to Colombia, with some of our help. But the operation
                    that we then had, we didn't feel we were getting very good cooperation and it
                    was not very successful. In Bolivia we felt that we had much more
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in Peru was the problem, we felt, more because they
                        werdifficult to deal with, or they had been paid off by the drug
                        producers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The former. They were difficult to deal with - differing prioritizes,
                    different sense of how you go about this. In both Peru and Bolivia, at that
                    time, cultivation was, if not expanding, if you succeeded in reducing it in one
                    area, it would go to another area, and neither government was effectively
                    preventing it moving to another area. And all those arguments that you made
                    about hurting the poor peasants - well, those don't really apply when it's
                    moving to a new area. So we had significant difference with governments in both
                    countries, more so in Peru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you saying we viewed Bolivia as more responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>SMITH: Somewhat better. It has become better since then, certainly, but they were
                    doing some successful tests on alternate crops. The problem in Bolivia, again,
                    people, poor peasants, needed to grow coca for livelihood. In fact, the poor
                    peasants who were growing coca were not traditional growers of coca. They had
                    come from the high plateau and moved down because there was an opportunity
                    there. I think that there was a greater sense of cooperation in Bolivia, but a
                    great deal of frustration as well, and this problem of the government unwilling
                    to prevent the spread into new areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Mexico rate at this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: A mixed situation, as now. The relationship with Mexico was always very
                    different in the sense that we did not have the kind of INP funded program there
                    that we had elsewhere. They insisted on doing things themselves. Mexico, of
                    course, is not part of one of our areas under control of one of our CINCs, but
                    we were working closely with the Mexican counter-narcotics police, transferring
                    Hueys from the U.S. military, not through INM, but as I recall directly from the
                    U.S. military. We did have a program there. As I recall, about the second year I
                    was there the Mexicans told us they would do it all themselves but then later
                    discovered that it was going to be expensive, and there was some real question
                    about how they could do it. The Mexicans had a very active program of
                    eradication of opium and marijuana, and their statistics were always very good
                    on that - not as good as Guatemala's. Guatemala, while I was working on it, the
                    intelligence community's estimate of Guatemalan production of opium fell to the
                    point where it was something like 40 hectares, plus or minus 200 - in other
                    words, the estimate was below their margin of confidence of what they could
                    predict. But in Mexico, they did a great deal of eradication, and the major
                    issues were much more trafficking and of high-level involvement and
                    money-laundering, as they were now. But our relationship with Mexico is always
                    very prickly. The question of extradition was very much there. Just before or
                    just about the time I moved in, we had - remember - the abduction of the Mexican
                    to the United States and trial in the United States. And that was a very
                    sensitive issue with the Mexicans. We had a high-level bilateral commission with
                    the Mexicans, one element of which is narcotics. We had regular narcotics
                    meetings with the Mexicans, but the issue was always DEA and the extent of
                    corruption within Mexico, different opinions about that. Another area where we
                    cooperated with the Mexicans, but had to do it fairly carefully, was on Central
                    America, because we and the Mexicans viewed Central America and the transit
                    through Central America rather similarly, and this was something we could
                    cooperate on, but the Central Americans didn't want to see this Mexican-U.S.
                    cooperation coming down on them. We did meet with the Mexicans and discuss
                    central America.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the major success or lack of success? I always think of the street
                    price of cocaine in Detroit or something like that. I mean, during these three
                    years, how did you think the war was going?</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, measures of success are very difficult. We never had a firm handle
                    on exactly how much was coming to the United States. If you used street prices,
                    I think street price did not increase substantially. There were periods when it
                    increased. In fact, there were periods when it increased so you could see there
                    was a relationship between interdiction and price; but overall, you couldn't say
                    that we were having a dent on price, simply because the supply was so great.
                    Consumption did drop in the United States in this period. And that was probably
                    as a result of our ad campaigns, the very intensive campaigns against the use of
                    drugs, which had a significant impact on the casual users. The number of
                    hard-core users didn't change as much, but the number of casual users did. The
                    contribution of that - you know, how much, who contributed that - clearly the
                    ONDC programs, C-Sap programs, had a major contribution to it; however, you can
                    argue that if there had been unimpeded growing and unimpeded access to the
                    United States, which there was not, the prices would have been even lower and
                    there would have been even more consumption. It would have been much harder to
                    have had the success with those ad campaigns that they did. And my own view is
                    that you do have to have some of these other programs. The key to it may be to
                    change the culture and thereby reduce consumption, but you have to have these
                    other campaigns because it's very hard, if the stuff is free or nearly free, to
                    prevent consumption. And there have been countries - China is an example...
                    China eradicated opium consumption, heroin consumption, right after the
                    Communists took over. It reappeared along the transit routes from Burma to the
                    Coast, from China to the Coast, and it's reappeared probably because truckers
                    are getting paid in product. It's a supply driven consumption rather than a
                    demand driven consumption, so you have to deal with both supply and demand
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice any change when the Clinton Administration
                        came iin January of '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, there was a skepticism about the interdiction programs and a
                    determination to focus more on the anti-consumption efforts in the United
                    States, which was probably good, but I certainly felt that you needed to
                    continue the anti-interdiction efforts, and that was very difficult if funding
                    was cut. That's when you got into these wranglings about getting additional
                    resources from DOD.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find relations between your bureau and ARA and other areas? Did
                    you find you were sort of getting in the way of other types of
                    relationships?</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think in ARA, the ambassadors were so involved in these programs, in
                    those three countries in particular, that in most of those countries there was
                    good cooperation. Certainly the people who were ambassadors in Colombia,
                    Bolivia, Peru were actively engaged. We were actively engaged. When high-level
                    delegations went down there, INM was included. I went down with Bernie Aronson
                    at one point. In AF we were much less actively engaged. We did successfully
                    refuse to certify Nigeria. I don't remember that being a major issue at that
                    point with AF, because I think everybody had decided that the Nigerian r�gime
                    was pretty bad and, in fact, this was one of the things we could do that was
                    justified and really put the screws on them. But it's always a difficult call
                    when you throw up your hands and say, this is terrible. In the case of Burma,
                    which is according to U.S. statistics, the major producer of opium in the world
                    and at that time the major source of heroin in the United States. There was
                    always a contradiction between wanting to cooperate with them against drug
                    trafficking and the human rights record of the Burmese government, which led to
                    a problem. However, they were never very good in their cooperation in
                    counter-narcotics. It could have been a much worse problem, but they never could
                    offer very much. So that was not a black and white issue, as it might have been.
                    But yes, there were problems in getting the bureaus, we thought, to put adequate
                    emphasis on narcotics issues. We always had an issue with the military in some
                    areas - not in Latin America, where the programs were very integrated. CINCPAC
                    used to go to Thailand and meet with the Thai military and not say anything
                    about narcotics, whereas that was a major issue as far as INM was concerned.</p>
                <p>There was one other area where I personally got involved, which was
                    India-Pakistan and legal growing of opium in India. India's the world's largest
                    grower of legal opium, under an international r�gime, and we're the largest
                    purchaser of legal opium from India. But there are always questions about
                    controls, and there are questions about trafficking between India and Pakistan.
                    And with the South Asian bureau's blessing we got involved with trying to get
                    India and Pakistan to cooperate in this area. And there was a meeting in 1994, I
                    believe it was, in Vienna, one of the last meetings I went to, where we seemed
                    to be making some success, because this was an area where you could argue that
                    this was important for counter-narcotics work and also important because it was
                    an area where India and Pakistan should cooperate. Even if they are so mad at
                    each other in all the other areas, it's one area where they should be able to
                    cooperate, and maybe it will build to other things.</p>

                <p>SMITH: Well, it was a logical extension in some areas. We had already been very
                    much involved in the counter-money laundering, and whether the money that's
                    being laundered is narcotics money or other money it's a logical thing. There
                    was reason to think that just as we were working not on cases but on general
                    counter-narcotics policy with other governments, it would be useful to expand
                    that to international crime. We had created a Dublin group to coordinate
                    international counter-narcotics policy with the EU and Japan and Canada, the
                    basic members - which we found very useful. We realized that in some parts of
                    the world - the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe being leading examples -
                    narcotics were a part of a larger problem, the problem of organized crime,
                    whereas in Latin America, as far as we were concerned, narcotics were the big
                    part, and organized crime was narcotics. In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
                    Union, organized crime was a lot of other things as well as counter-narcotics,
                    and to have an international effort with U.S. involvement to counter organized
                    crime, beyond just money-laundering, we thought would be useful. We had to think
                    of what we were going to do, how that was going to translate, and we came up
                    with some programs, and we also found that there were areas of U.S. interest
                    that were falling between bureaucratic stools which this newly-formed bureau
                    could pick up. An example of the first, something that specifically would be
                    useful for the U.S. to do against international organized crime, where you could
                    develop a program: trafficking in stolen vehicles, developing systems for
                    vehicle identification numbers, registration, making sure that they're caught
                    and returned. We had some initial success in Central America on that, and it's
                    an issue also with Eastern Europe. This is a logical thing that's directly in
                    our interest and is a good example. An example of an area where the bureau got
                    involved in other things because it was there - alien smuggling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: International policy against alien smuggling. I mentioned that I headed
                    the U.S. delegation to the UN Crime Commission twice in 1994, and we made this a
                    major issue, because this is something that actually is not illegal in a lot of
                    countries, and laws had to be passed against alien smuggling, the kinds of
                    things, and of course there was a major question of coordination within the U.S.
                    government and with other governments on specific cases. You know, the ship
                    shows up headed for Mexico and diverted to Guatemala, so you're working with the
                    Mexicans, you're working with the Guatemalans, the U.S. Coast Guard, the INS -
                    everybody's involved, very complicated. This is beyond those that landed in New
                    York or on the West Coast.</p>
                <p>And the third area, which has become a major part of the work of this office,
                    which was just beginning at that time, comes into what I'm working on now, which
                    is the fact that when you had the peacekeeping operation, the troops go in -
                    Haiti, Somalia - who's going to perform the police function when those troops go
                    in?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The U.S. military sure doesn't want to do it, and the U.S. MPs aren't
                    trained for that. They're trained for police work within the military. They
                    aren't trained for crowd control and those kinds of things. You've got to have a
                    fast-acting program to retrain the military of those countries and also the
                    justice and penal systems. But the most immediate one has to focus on the police
                    of those countries, to get that police function up and running in an honest way.
                    And INM - INL - was working on that in Somalia - too little, too late because it
                    was just getting started when we pulled out - worked on that in Haiti, where it
                    had more success, has been a major factor in the Internet- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we ahead of the game in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We were ahead of other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: We were ahead of other countries, but we weren't ahead of the game. And
                    even now, you are seeing this in Kosovo, where NATO is complaining that the UN
                    isn't acting fast enough to get the police on the ground. The problem is that,
                    internationally and in the U.S., the military is ready to deploy. The military
                    has police forces which can be [ready] to go somewhere else. The recent example
                    of that, actually NATO has been fairly successful in Bosnia. They have an MUF -
                    Multiple Uses Force? I forget what that's an acronym for, but it's the Italian
                    Carabinieri, who do fit that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course, the Carabinieri are a military -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They're military. They're trained. They're military officers doing police
                    functions, and that's just what you need, and they're going to be in Kosovo
                    also. We learned in Kosovo, and it took three years to get the Carabinieri into
                    Bosnia. In Kosovo we were ready to get them in right away. It still wasn't soon
                    enough, but its going to be a lot sooner than it was in Bosnia. But in addition
                    to that, because that's a foreign police force coming in and providing an actual
                    police function, you need to create a local force. And the creation of the local
                    force is... Actually the Department of Justice has an organization called ISITAP
                    which actually does it, but the policy and the funding is coming from INL.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you running across, as you started to do this, the problem that had come
                    up before, that Congress didn't like to see strange foreign police forces
                    because they might get involved in beating up their own citizens and that sort
                    of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>SMITH: It's a question you should ask Bob Gelbard, because he was the one who was
                    present at the negotiations on this. My impression was that Congress was willing
                    to have it happen because is saw the need in Somalia and Haiti, which were the
                    first two. There was a clear need for this, and it was different from the old
                    training of police forces. It was creating a new honest force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was inserting something in where there was chaos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: And it wasn't dealing with an old force with a questionable human rights
                    record. It was taking the old force and transforming it into something that
                    would be acceptable, as far as we were concerned, both in a police and a human
                    rights sense. So the purpose was very different, and there was Congressional
                    support. But AID didn't want to touch it - is what I've heard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They'd been badly burned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: They'd been very badly burned by that, so you end up with INL doing the
                    coordination for the policy function, and ISITAP doing the implementation. It's
                    a different function, but fits in well with the other things that INL is
                    doing.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, probably this is a good place to stop. So in '94, we left you where you
                    were working on crime matters on this, and then where did you go?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the President checked the right box, and I was able tgo into
                    language training to go into Tajikistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, so we'll pick this up in '94 in
                        Tajikistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, '95 in Tajikistan. I had a year of language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll talk about training, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>It is September 2, 1999. Grant, in the first place, how did you geyour assignment
                    as ambassador to Tajikistan?</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it's a very complicated process, but it goes through the D Committee
                    in the State Department and then over to the White House. And it went to the D
                    Committee, as I recall, in probably June of '94, and then over to the White
                    House, and it did it. It took a while to send everything over to the White
                    House. It didn't go over right away, and it took some urging to get them to send
                    over - there were two of us who wanted to have as much language training as
                    possible before we went out, and we were then able to get a Presidential
                    decision in late August, as I recall, so that I was able to start Tajik in early
                    September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you get the appointment? Did you lobby for
                        it?Did somebody come out to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Can I say yes, all of the above? You have to do a fair amount of lobbying
                    with the people who are on the D Committee, or their staff assistants, as the
                    case may be. And people may talk about putting your name forward for several,
                    and you need to state a preference, and it's always, Where do you want to go,
                    where do your qualifications give you the strongest shot at going?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I assume when you're playing around with Central Asia, to a certain
                    extent you don't feel the heat of political appointees dying to get in there
                    that you might in some other place. Maybe I'm wrong.</p>
                <p>SMITH: No, I think that's true, and it's also true, at least in '94, there
                    weren't many established experts on Central Asia, so the people they were
                    looking at to go to Central Asia were people who had experience in the former
                    Soviet Union - specifically in the Soviet Union - or had experience in adjacent
                    areas which were relevant. In my case it was South Asia. You know, a Turkic or
                    Turkish speaking person would be a similar kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume probably in later times we're going to start coming up with
                    congressional staff assistants who've got a master's degree in Central Asian
                    studies and all of a sudden they want to be an ambassador. You'll start seeing
                    there's more of an influx of staff assistants from Congress who end up as
                    ambassadors.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I can see that that might happen in the future, but as say, in '94,
                    this is not particularly an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Tajikistan. Could you give us the location
                        and thhistory of the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>SMITH: It's directly north of Afghanistan, and in fact it was the easternmost
                    part of Tajikistan that was closest to India, and in the 1890s, when the
                    Russians and the British drew the map, they drew a tongue of Afghanistan that
                    goes out and which separated Russia and British India. That's the Wakhan
                    Corridor, and that part of what was then under Russian control is now
                    Tajikistan. So this was the “Great Game” territory, and some adjacent areas.
                    Parts of what is now Tajikistan were under Russian control in the late 19th
                    century - the north and the far east - however, the major bulk of the south was
                    part of the Emirate of Bukhara, which was a Russian protectorate but not under
                    direct Russian control. When the Soviet Union was formed, I think it was in 1924
                    they created a Tajikistan Autonomous Republic, and then in 1929 it became a full
                    Soviet republic, with the current boundaries. It's one of the cases where - and
                    Stalin has been accused of doing this elsewhere - the boundaries were drawn in a
                    way that there were major irredenta left on both sides. The centers for Tajik
                    culture and population at that time were the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara,
                    which remain in Uzbekistan. But even today, those cities are Tajik-speaking. You
                    go there, you can speak Tajik and get around quite well. There's no problem
                    whatsoever. So they created a republic for the Tajik nationality, in the Soviet
                    sense, but the two key centers of that nationality are not in it, plus of the
                    current population of five and a half million, about a quarter of that is Uzbek.
                    So there were significant concentrations of Uzbeks left within Tajikistan. And
                    the area is 90-some percent mountains. The Pamirs are there. I guess its major
                    natural resource is water, which means it has plenty of irrigation water for
                    growing in the valleys and under the Soviets was a producer of cotton, with some
                    of the highest yields in the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Q: Had the Soviets done what they had done in Afghanistan and other places, of
                    sort of ruining the soil, or was there enough water so they didn't?</p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a cotton monoculture with very heavy doses of fertilizer and
                    pesticides; however, way down the line, there was plenty of water, so you hadn't
                    had the kind of degradation that you had in the Aral Sea area. And since
                    independence, since they haven't had any money to buy fertilizers and
                    pesticides, that part of the situation has probably gotten better. Tajikistan
                    has some minerals. They'd like to say that they have every mineral that's in the
                    periodic table, which is probably true, but the problem is that either the way
                    it is found or the location of it makes it very expensive to get out, and
                    whether they have every mineral in the periodic table that can be profitably
                    mined is an altogether different question. They do have some gold. They have
                    significant deposits of silver. Uranium - they like to say that the uranium for
                    the first Soviet bomb came from Tajikistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in '94, was it -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I was in language training. My wife and I were the only two people in the
                    class. We began language training here at FSI in September of '94. We continued
                    in language training through June of '95 and went out there in July o'95.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: July of '95 to August of '98. Q: Well, let's talk a bit about the
                    language. How did you and your wife find the language, and what were you picking
                    up from your instructors?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, it's interesting how FSI came to teach Tajik, in the sense that FSI
                    has on its permanent staff a Dari instructor - the language of Afghanistan - and
                    there was great demand for learning Dari back in the late '70s and the '80s -
                    much less demand now, since we have no embassy in Kabul. We have one position or
                    two positions in Peshawar that are Dari-speaking, but not much demand for
                    training people in Dari. So they asked the Dari instructor to teach Tajik. What
                    they didn't know was that their Dari instructor was an ethnic Tajik, and Tajik
                    was his mother tongue. So that worked out quite well. The problem was that he
                    knows Tajik of northern Afghanistan as it was when he grew up. There is the
                    Tajik of Tajikistan. It's the same language, but being part of the Soviet Union,
                    there are a lot of concepts which were translated from Russian into Tajik which
                    really don't mean anything to somebody who doesn't know the Soviet Union and
                    where that concept came from - the concept of “village economy” or even
                    “collective farm.” Or the Soviets, now the Russians, use tractors with tracks,
                    like small Caterpillars, which they don't use in Afghanistan. And all these
                    things, when you translate the Russian word or concept into Tajik, becomes
                    something that was foreign to our Afghan-born Tajik language instructor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out there, what were you getting from
                        the... Iwas in the European Bureau, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course, by then, and totally now, the special assistant to the
                    Secretary, Strobe Talbott then - actually it was Jim Collins by then - really
                    acts and functions like an assistant secretary. So you really have an ESNIS
                    bureau that isn't a bureau but functions like a bureau. That was true then, and
                    it's true now. It shares the executive bureau functions with EUR. EUR/EX does
                    the executive stuff, but for an operational sense, ESNIS is a separate bureau.
                    Q: As you were reading your way, going through the corridors, talking to people,
                    what were you seeing as the situation in Tajikistan and American concerns
                    there?</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, our major concern then, and it has continued, has been the civil war
                    and, because of our interest in the region, that this be resolved. The civil war
                    broke out in 1992. It was basically between groups with strong regional
                    identities, although there were other overlays there, in the sense that one of
                    the groups, primarily from the area to the east of Dushanbe, also was the most
                    Muslim, and included the leadership of the opposition as it is now in the
                    Islamic Renaissance Party. But there are other members of that opposition also.
                    Then the other group, from the area south oDushanbe and also from the northern
                    part of the country has much more of a sort of old Communist association,
                    although the Communist Party, which still exists, opposed the government on a
                    number of points.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you got out to Dushanbe in what, the early summer of
                        '95?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk a bit about you and your wife living in
                        Dushanbe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: I think by then Dushanbe was the only place where the embassy and the
                    living quarters were still in the hotel. That was the way it was, I believe, in
                    all of the posts of the former Soviet Union when they were first opened. People
                    came in and set up shop in a hotel, and you had an office in the hotel and you
                    lived in the hotel. But this was, by then 1995, four years after independence,
                    and in Dushanbe the embassy was still living and operating out of a hotel. This
                    was the old Communist Party hotel, the Hotel October or Oktoberskaya, where the
                    embassy, by the time we got there, had the whole top floor. The top floor was
                    divided up. About half of it was offices and American living quarters, and the
                    other half was FSN offices. When we arrived, I think with one exception, the
                    entire staff lived there. Essentially, officers were on one side of the
                    corridor, and rooms were on the other side. I had an office that was about 9' by
                    12' maybe. Fairly small. The Chinese ambassador when he returned my call on him,
                    sort of looked around the office and there was a pause, and he said, “This is a
                    very small office for an ambassador.” And across the hall I had a living room
                    and a bedroom, and then we had a common officers' mess. We had a cook, and each
                    of us had consumables where we'd contribute things for the officers' mess. We
                    used to joke that the Soviet Union had to fall before we really found out about
                    Communism, because that was essentially how we were living. However, very
                    quickly we managed to get the staff out, and I think that within a year we had
                    everybody but ourselves out of the hotel.</p>
                <p>Q: A question I forgot to ask was how did Tajikistan leave the Soviet Union. I
                    know about the same time I spent three weeks in Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, and the
                    Kyrgyz were sort of yanked squealing from the womb of the Soviet Union. They
                    were getting more out of it than they were putting in, and it was very obvious
                    that they weren't coming out particularly ahead on this. How about with the
                    Tajiks?</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think basically the same thing was true in the case of Tajikistan, that
                    the Tajiks didn't want independence, and economics was one of the reasons,
                    because Tajikistan, as Kyrgyzstan, was one of those republics, which, according
                    to Soviet statistics, were a net drain on the center. The center financed a lot
                    of things, and under Soviet times, they had things in Tajikistan which they
                    wouldn't have had except for that support for Moscow. They had an Academy of
                    Sciences. They had an opera, a ballet. Even at the district level they had
                    cultural centers and did operas and plays, orchestra. So there was an
                    infrastructure there that came from the center, that came with being a republic,
                    an educational structure, that strictly on the basis of their own production
                    they probably wouldn't have had.</p>
                <p>Q: I'll go back to Bishkek, where there was a big helicopter factory, which they
                    were trying to figure out what to do with because they were no longer making
                    helicopters.</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's true. They had in their economic system factories which were
                    totally tied in to other parts of the Soviet Union, that would make one part for
                    something, and unless they were integrated into that they had no reason to
                    exist. They also had things which could only exist because of the peculiarities,
                    or mainly existed because of peculiarities, of the Soviet economic system. One
                    of the world's largest aluminum smelters is in Tajikistan, and it's there
                    because of hydroelectric power. But all the raw materials have to come from the
                    Ukraine or farther. And under the Soviet transportation pricing system, this
                    made economic sense. However, after independence, when transportation costs
                    became real costs, it suddenly became - depending on whose economics you use -
                    marginally profitable or unprofitable. And it was totally integrated, and then
                    being torn off or being put aside and having the economic system elsewhere
                    collapse, it left Tajikistan and the other small countries in a very strange
                    situation. They said to me that the one person who had served as prime minister
                    under both the opposition and then the current government, and that the reason
                    he had been kept on in the position is that the prime minister position in
                    Tajikistan, as in many other of the former Soviet republics, is an economic
                    position. The reason he had been kept on was that he was the one who had the
                    contacts and he could keep this system operating. He could call up people in
                    other republics and cut deals. You know, we'll send you so many wagonloads of
                    cotton or of aluminum in return for X, Y, or Z, because everything had
                    degenerated to barter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about dealing with the government there, on
                        youpart?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. First let me say that the ten months of learning Tajik were very well
                    spent because the number of English-speakers among the senior level is very
                    small. There are a younger cadre that know English, particularly those who've
                    participated in one of our programs, like the Bradley Program, but at the
                    government level very few, so you're working in Russian or Tajik. In the case of
                    Tajikistan, they had always kept their language, and they felt very strongly
                    about that language, and as early as 1989, although they didn't want to leave
                    the Soviet Union, they did want to have their language, and they had a language
                    law beginning in 1989 pressing the use of Tajik. So having studied Tajik I was
                    able to do a lot of my business in Tajik, and in I kept working it, so by the
                    time I left I could have private meetings in Tajik without an interpreter
                    necessary. And since my predecessor had also been a non-Russian speaker-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Stan Escudero, a Farsi-speaker, mutually intelligible - we got a lot of
                    credit for speaking the national language rather than Russian. The first
                    independence day I was there, a big meeting, the whole government, the president
                    gets up and gives his speech; the Russian ambassador gets up and gives his
                    speech, how Russia will always support the government. Well, we can't say that -
                    we're in a much more neutral position vis-�-vis the government of the opposition
                    - but I get up and read the President's message in Tajik: I got as much applause
                    as the Russian, because I'd done it in Tajik. And I think that in general, being
                    able to work in Tajik was a tremendous advantage. There are people who even
                    maintained that in some meetings, for some people the nature of the conversation
                    would change depending on the language you were in, that the Russian tended to
                    be a much more formal and set-piece kind of thing, and you couldn't have the
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure, because this was what you used when you
                        dealwith officials.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. The Tajiks are a very hospitable people, and we even used to
                    like to joke that they engaged in “hospitality terrorism.” They would sort of
                    kidnap you, and a five-minute cup of tea, if you were really pushy, you could
                    get out in half an hour, but it usually involved a full meal and going on for
                    hours. So you had to be very careful. There was not any problem in having direct
                    relationships with the Tajiks. You didn't have to do everything through the
                    government, and you didn't have the feeling that everything was controlled. You
                    could invite people for dinner, get invited for dinner or tea, and move
                    basically around as you would in another place - which we greatly appreciated.
                    I'm not sure I would have liked a totally controlled atmosphere. Kyrgyzstan is
                    the same way.</p>
                <p>Q: Say you'd go in and see government officials. Were they much interested in
                    what the United States was about, and all? Did you feel you were playing much of
                    a role there, or was it -</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>SMITH: Tremendous interest in the United States, some of it misplaced, in the
                    sense that they seemed to think that we were going to replace Moscow and that
                    money which used to come from Moscow would now come from the United States.
                    Well, yes, we were going to provide, and are providing significant economic
                    assistance, but it isn't the same way that it used to come from Moscow at all.
                    Not much understanding of the United States. I'd often felt that the concept to
                    understand a colony you have to understand the mother country, at least for the
                    first few years after independence. In India the views of the Indian
                    establishment about the United States were very much colored by the London
                    School of Economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Fabian Socialists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In French-speaking Africa, when we were there, the views othe United
                    States were very much those of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of the intellectuals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The French intellectuals. So there were certainly a fair number of people,
                    even if they hadn't come up through the KGB, who had a Soviet view of the United
                    States, just because they'd grown up in that education and that atmosphere. So
                    there was a considerable amount of misunderstanding, which I think... I was
                    skeptical of the Bradley Program when I went out, but I-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Bradley Program is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Bradley Program... We had significant exchange programs with the
                    former Soviet Union, the Bradley Program being the most different from what
                    we've done elsewhere, in the sense that we were bringing high-school students,
                    large numbers of them, over to spend a year in the United States. And this sort
                    of goes against what I'd always thought about exchanges, which was you wanted to
                    work at the graduate level and later, because that was when people were really
                    established enough in their own country and could come over and appreciate the
                    United States. But when you need to jumpstart a relationship, change the
                    outlook, get a large number of people with a different point of view and have
                    English, the Bradley program worked very well, because we did begin to get these
                    youngsters who really knew quite a bit about the United States, and it was
                    really very useful to get at this whole mindset.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and also I would imagine the kids that came over would essentially belong
                    to or be associated with those who were ruling the country, for the most part -
                    I mean, just because their family would be aware of the program and all
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>SMITH: I suspect that was true a fair amount. We, of course, ran it trying to
                    prevent that, so that it was strictly on the basis of merit, and we had a lot of
                    complaints from people - “My son didn't get selected.” There were some other
                    programs that were much more that way. There was a sister cities program between
                    the northern capital of the country and Lincoln, Nebraska, which had an element
                    of exchanges there, and those tended to be focused on the elite.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, now, what were we doing there?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, our major objective, as I alluded earlier, in Tajikistan, has been
                    to support the peace process there, to prevent Tajikistan from being a source of
                    trouble in the region or a conduit for trouble in the region. And therefore, the
                    best way to do that is to have the reconciliation process - the Kosovo War and
                    Reconciliation Process - work, and we were working at a number of levels to
                    achieve that. There was a UN-sponsored mediation going on, which had begun in
                    '94, which we strongly supported. We were not one of the countries that were
                    officially part of that. In other words, there were certain countries that were
                    officially associated with it. We were not one of them, and the Russians
                    probably would have objected to our official associations. On the other hand, we
                    played a more active role than any of the countries that were directly
                    associated with it, except for Russia and Iran, simply by whenever there was a
                    meeting making sure that we had high-level representation in the corridors and
                    able to influence. And our influence was through lobbying. Before there was a
                    meeting, we would lobby both sides. Before, we would make public statements,
                    sometimes quite specific, being critical of one side or the other, working
                    closely with the United Nations on the whole mediation process and also with the
                    Russians - obviously not with the Iranians, who were another major player. And
                    as the process proceeded, in June of 1997, they finally had a peace agreement,
                    or a group of peace agreements that had been negotiated over the previous few
                    years and were finally put together in a package and the total package signed
                    and approved in June of '97. We designed programs to support that, or supported
                    programs which were supporting the peace process. We pushed the World Bank and
                    the IMF to come in with some post-conflict credits. The World Bank, I think
                    partly under our pressure, moved with surprising speed, and the IMF. The Bank
                    and the IMF announced their credits within six months of the signing of the
                    peace accords, which is light speed for them and much faster than they generally
                    act. And we had a lot of programs of our own that supported this, both USIS
                    programs - again, USIS has an advantage that it can move fairly quickly... In
                    '97, we brought to the United States, for example, two groups of politicians to
                    learn about political parties. In both groups you had both opposition and
                    government. In fact, we had senior members of banned political parties included
                    in these groups, with the government's knowledge. In 1998, we brought a group
                    over called Religion and Democracy to look at how we deal with that issue in the
                    United States, and I think it had a direct effect on the political process. The
                    people who designed the program - I give them a lot of credit - took these
                    Tajiks to Salt Lake City, which I would not have thought of, but it was a good
                    idea.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>SMITH: And that group came back. I think it opened up their thinking. One of the
                    participants in it had been the head of the Islamic Renaissance Party before it
                    was banned. He came back, and as he came back, there was a very difficult
                    negotiation underway about the language in a political party's bill, and the
                    government was trying to say that there can be no religious-based parties, which
                    would have undercut the whole peace process. The negotiations on that were
                    rigid. They were only looking at secularism or this kind of thing. And he came
                    in with a different point of view and proposed a compromise that solved the
                    problem. And I think that his experience in the United States had something to
                    do with it. He didn't say do something about taxation, but what he did was to
                    propose a solution which was that religious institutions shall not be used for
                    political purposes - which solved the problem. So I think DARE, in our work with
                    both sides, private quiet meetings with both sides, pressure, had some effect,
                    and I think that our aid programs were able to have some effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing with our aid programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, of course, the Bank and the Fund we were major players with, and it
                    was nice, we often got credit for what the Bank and the Fund did. I wasn't going
                    to complain. We had had an aid program of some type there, but we were able,
                    after the peace accords were signed, to begin looking for things that would
                    specifically support the peace process. And the kind of things that we were able
                    to do was to put money in programs which would provide employment for
                    demobilized fighters, two specific projects in the main opposition area. They
                    were not U.S.-direct programs. One was done by the Aga Khan Foundation, one was
                    done by the UN. We put money into it, and we were the only ones who were putting
                    money into those projects. I think that since then they've gotten some others,
                    but we certainly led the way.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that dealing there would be quite difficult because, one,
                    you have Iran, which had pretensions of becoming the great Islamic influence,
                    and then you also had these very fundamental Afghans, who were still fighting a
                    civil war, for one thing, and messing around there. And I would have though that
                    these would be two very disturbing factors.</p>
                <p>SMITH: They were, and the certainly influenced the security situation. The
                    Iranians, for their own reasons, particularly in '95-97, were working closely
                    with the Russians, each pushing its respective client in the direction of peace,
                    because the Iranians, of course, were concerned about what was going on in
                    Afghanistan, with the Taliban, and I think the Iranians recognized that a
                    successful peace in Tajikistan would prevent the spread of what was going on in
                    Afghanistan to the north. The Russians and the Iranians both knew that. And of
                    course now you had this situation where the Russians and the Iranians are both
                    helping to resupply the opposition to the Taliban through Tajikistan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation like in Dushanbe while you were
                        there witthe war on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: In some ways it got worse while we were there, in the sense that the war
                    itself had been fought in 1992, and that's when there was fighting in Dushanbe
                    and the area south of Dushanbe. When we arrived in Dushanbe, it was quiet from
                    that standpoint. There were occasional killings related to the civil war,
                    particularly of Russian servicemen, but there was no real fighting in the city.
                    The fighting when we first arrived there was largely in the eastern part of the
                    country, thKarategin Valley, which was about a hundred miles east of Dushanbe.
                    There was a cease-fire achieved there in late '96, and that and the peace
                    accords essentially led to the end of the fighting there. However, the process
                    of implementing the peace accords brought tension closer to Dushanbe, so that we
                    had a series of incidents near and in Dushanbe. Let's see if I can give the
                    sequence here.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>In August of 1997, there was fighting in the northern part of the city. The
                    German ambassador was pinned down in his house for a day. This was the two parts
                    of the government, which were fighting with each other, because what had
                    happened at the end of the civil war - the civil war on the what became the
                    government side had been fought largely by private armies. When that side won
                    and became the government, they then incorporated those private armies in
                    different parts of the government. And many of them then took on mafia-like
                    crime controls, with geographic sectors. And the fighting in Dushanbe was
                    between the Customs and the Ministry of Interior troops, basically over turf in
                    the northern part of the city. So this is two parts of the government fighting.
                    There was a significant amount of ordnance expended, very, very few casualties.
                    At one point, I remember, we had a pre-scheduled call at what they called an
                    “open university,” and since it had associated with it some people who had
                    significant positions in the opposition, we were there. We had lunch sitting
                    outside in a grove of fruit trees. This was in the center of the city, watching
                    the smoke come up from the northern part of the city. I was reminded of the
                    French movie Black and White in Color - La victoire en chantant - the French
                    bouffes watching the First World War in Africa. Then again, in late April of
                    1998, there was significant fighting in the city. No, wait a minute - I should
                    back that up and say later on in 1997 there were explosions. There had been
                    explosions, and those explosions intensified in September and October. They were
                    largely seen to be designed to send a message, because they weren't killing
                    people, but they were blowing up a kiosk or something like that. Then in
                    November of '97, there was an incident, a kidnaping by a renegade group that had
                    once been part of the opposition but was no longer part of the opposition. The
                    same group which had taken some UN hostages in early '97 in November of '97 took
                    two French people hostage, a Frenchman and his wife. He worked for the EU, and
                    she had just gotten a contract with UNHCR, and they were kidnapped. He got away,
                    but she was killed in the rescue attempt. This was in November of '97, and that
                    was in and around Dushanbe. And then in April of '98, there was again
                    significant fighting within the city, this time between the government, the
                    Ministry of the Interior troops, and an opposition element, which was not far
                    from Dushanbe. And I mentioned that with the peace accords, the friction had
                    come closer to Dushanbe because that was the area where the government and the
                    opposition were most interwoven, and it was hardest to have disarmament and
                    cantonment of the opposition. In the East it wasn't very hard, because it was
                    all opposition controlled. This was the front, the area of friction, and this
                    was an opposition commander who was not totally under the opposition control and
                    the Ministry of the Interior commander, who, as we'd heard in August, had a
                    strong position in the government and some very direct feelings, so that time
                    there was very significant fighting in the eastern part of the city, including
                    in the airport area.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk about dealing with your staff, particularly the Americans,
                    because at least my experience observing in my little time in Kyrgyzstan, there
                    isn't a hell of a lot to do, and- (end of tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>SMITH: I think we had good morale. In posts like Dushanbe you want to get people
                    who want to come to begin with, and some members of the staff I or my DCM had
                    recruited directly. And you need people who are self-sufficient or who can make
                    a life for themselves in this kind of a situation, and we had some of them -
                    people who just thrive on this kind of a situation. We had one member of the
                    staff who, when she was looking for another assignment, wanted something like
                    this. She wanted to go to Sarajevo. This was in '96. There is an international
                    community there. There's a UN community, both the UN peacekeepers, or UN
                    observers, and the staff of the UN mission there, plus UNDP, plus a lot of NGOs
                    - OSCE. So there is an international community. It does become difficult when
                    there's a security situation and you have to stay home. There's not just a
                    night-time curfew but an all-time curfew. But the Tajiks, in response to the
                    security situation in Dushanbe, when we arrived and I think the whole time we
                    were there, had stopped having their weddings and other celebrations in the
                    evenings and were having them all in the afternoon. So again, in the middle of
                    these incidents in Dushanbe city you may have a wedding going on in the hotel
                    with lots of music and dancing. And the Tajiks liked their music and
                    dancing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the president, when I was there and still the president, Rakhmonov,
                    who had been a kolkhoz chairman before independence -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a collective farm.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, and was sort of chosen to be president, first speaker and then
                    president, by the commanders of these private armies. He was not one himself. He
                    was a compromise, chosen to be that, so he had to deal by negotiation with them.
                    He did not have a huge army of his own. I saw him periodically, not the kind of
                    sort of weekly or monthly post relationship that we had in some places. Much
                    more frequent meetings with the foreign minister, the foreign affairs advisor to
                    the president, the prime minister, the other economic ministers. And later on,
                    when we had a commission of national reconciliation in Dushanbe, with opposition
                    government members, with both sides who were members of that commission, and we
                    had points to make on issues of the national reconciliation and implementation
                    of the peace accords, we were able to lobby with all concerned on those. I could
                    usually get an appointment on fairly short notice. We had a senior FSN... First
                    of all, I should say we had some exceptionally competent Foreign Service
                    nationals, some of the best I've encountered anywhere in my Foreign Service
                    career. And some of the women - one of them had been an official in the Council
                    of Ministers before independence and brought over with her just an enormous
                    number of relationships and access to people in the government. She also, very
                    soon after her arrival, arranged that we get one of these government telephones.
                    You can dial anybody else in the government with three digits, and they answer
                    that phone because it's the government phone, it's not an outside line. So we
                    had one, and the Russian embassy had one. She had it on her desk, but when I
                    wanted to get a hold of somebody, I could go in and use that phone. She'd get
                    him on the line, and I'd talk to him in Tajik, either to arrange a meeting, deal
                    with some problem, make a d�marche sometimes - but it was extremely useful. And
                    I always like to say that in diplomacy you can save a tremendous amount of time
                    if you can establish the relationships so that you can do some of your business
                    on the telephone. And this was a case where between the language and this phone
                    - and the relationships - we were able to do some of that. It was very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role in your relationship with the
                        Russiaambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, first of all, the Russian embassy was downstairs. The Russian
                    embassy had the whole third floor of the hotel; we had the fourth floor. And
                    this produced a sense of cohabitation, I suppose you'd call it. It probably
                    didn't exist anywhere else in the world. In 1992, when the embassy was closed -
                    evacuated - the Russian ambassador arranged for some Russian APCs to take the
                    embassy staff to the airport. And those APCs came under fire on the way back,
                    and there were some casualties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: APCs are armored personnel carriers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Right. “BTRs” in the Russian sense. So we had a particular relationship.
                    The Russian ambassador when I arrived there, Sinkievich, pretty much an old Cold
                    Warrior - heavy into alcohol, and if you've done an interview with Peter
                    Galbraith, you will hear more about him because he went from Dushanbe to Zagreb,
                    and I was talking to Peter about him last weekend.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm working on Peter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: It was a fairly formal relationship except when we got together and
                    consumed quantities of vodka. But his successor, Bielov, a much younger, much
                    less (at least on the surface) of a Cold Warrior, much more of a person who
                    clearly was there doing a job, didn't posture as much, and we obviously
                    disagreed with them, but we had some common interests, particularly on the
                    security side, because of the location of the embassy. And sometime he'd enlist
                    our support, sometimes we'd enlist their support on security issues, and of
                    course in the background of all that you can imagine that our security office
                    (and I'm sure their security office) were paranoid about this locationship
                    question. In other words, that they were just downstairs from us, and we were
                    just upstairs from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The Russians lived in their embassy, and they were not moving out. The
                    Russian ambassador finally moved out about the last six months that we were
                    there, and he was the first person in their embassy to move out. Everybody else
                    was still living in the hotel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have Russian flight from Tajikistan?</hi>

                <p>SMITH: No. You are really asking about the Russian community or the Russian
                    presence. Well, of course, the biggest part of the Russian presence was
                    military. When the Soviet Union broke up, they left the 201st Motorized Rifle
                    Division in Dushanbe as a Russian division. In some other places the units
                    became part of the local forces. In the case of Tajikistan, this is still a
                    Russian division, which is there as part of the peacekeeping force, but which
                    doesn't function as we would think a peacekeeping force would functions. It's
                    more of a presence. Plus Russian border troops. Now Russian border forces in
                    Tajikistan are 80 or 90 percent Tajik. When they have a draft, some of the
                    draftees go into the Tajik army, some of them go into the Tajik Ministry of the
                    Interior, some of them go to the Russian border forces. But the command and
                    control of those border forces is in Moscow, and not the Russian Ministry of
                    Defense, not the Russian Ministry [of Interior] - a separate entity. So you had
                    roughly at some point I think it was the figure they were quoting was about
                    20,000, although by the time I left it was significantly less than that, Russian
                    border forces - plus a motorized rifle division - each with separate lines of
                    command and control to Moscow, separate from the Russian embassy. The Russian
                    community itself, other than this, had dropped dramatically from
                    pre-independence to post-independence. In Tajikistan the Russian community was
                    always one of the smallest in the former Soviet Union. The figure I heard from
                    the Russian ambassador was that before independence it was 450,000, which is
                    nine percent - that's about right. After independence it had dropped to 70,000,
                    and most of those were pensioners, particularly sad cases. So this was roughly
                    the Russian community there. And you were asking about flights -</p>
                <p>Q: I noticed in Kyrgyzstan the Russians were the entrepreneurs. They were running
                    boot shops and things of this nature, whereas the Kyrgyz were going into
                    government offices with briefcases. But really, the Russians, those that were
                    left, were kind of running the underpinnings of living in the country.</p>
                <p>SMITH: In Tajikistan there were some Russian businessmen left, but of course,
                    Tajikistan had always had a bazaar community, and even under the Soviets they'd
                    had very active markets. And they continued that.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, the Kyrgyz were horse people, and the - SMITH: The Tajiks were settled.
                    Now of the Central Asians, the Tajiks and the Uzbeks were their Sarts, which
                    were the settled ones; and the Kyrgyz and the Kazakhs and the Turkomen were all
                    the nomads. And that was the key distinction before the Soviets, anyway. The
                    Russian community in Tajikistan was an awful lot of technical people, experts in
                    certain fields. With the breakup of the Soviet Union - I think this was true
                    everywhere - a portion of Aeroflot's planes were given to the country, which
                    then set up its own airline, and that airline then provided the connections to
                    Moscow. The only flights out of the country were to the former Soviet Union.
                    There were occasions when there were flights beyond them. The flights were to
                    Moscow, one a week to Bishkek, and sometimes one a week to Ashgabat.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Q: How Muslim in truth was Tajikistan? Again, I go back to Kyrgyzstan. It was
                    technically Muslim, but I would suspect that just from all accounts it really
                    was non-believing.</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, in a cultural sense, the Tajiks were very Muslim. They had done a
                    good job of retaining their language and their festivals and traditions. By the
                    time I left, the last meeting of Parliament that I attended was totally in
                    Tajik. They had all of their festivals, many of which had been repressed during
                    the Soviet period and even the non-religious traditional festivals had been
                    repressed. On the other hand, AID sponsored a public survey, one of the
                    questions of which was how many times a day do you pray? I think only two
                    percent played five times a day. It was a very low number, in any case. So these
                    are people who think of themselves as Muslim, but much more in a cultural way
                    than in a strictly religious way. But it does vary with parts of the country,
                    and there are some fairly serious Muslims, particularly among the
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this sort of same light, what about the spillover
                        froAfghanistan, where things got very religious there? I was wondering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the Taliban were far too fundamentalist for even the opposition - at
                    least that's my view. There were some differences of opinion within the
                    opposition about the Taliban, but certainly you would hear the opposition saying
                    things like, “Well, we'll still need some Russian troops on the border because
                    of the situation in Afghanistan.” The fundamentalism of the Taliban is basically
                    not fundamentalism... Well, it is the way of life of very religious rural
                    Afghanistan, whereas many of the Tajik opposition leaders, although they may
                    have come originally from rural Tajikistan, were in fact literate in Russian as
                    well as Tajik and comparatively well educated. I mean, Tajikistan is a country
                    with over 90 percent literacy - like the rest of the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: That was one of the things, of course, that the Soviets had brought. The
                    women had thrown off their burqas, their veils, in the early Soviet period and
                    had a significant role, some of that achieved by quotas. And to some extent, at
                    the end of the Soviet system, the number of women in high places was declining.
                    There was still a woman minister of education. There were some women in other
                    significant positions, but there were very few in parliament, and there were
                    some reports that education of women was dropping, sometimes because of
                    religious influence, sometimes for economic reasons. There were a couple of
                    areas under opposition controls where there were reports of women being made to
                    wear head scarves, there was one area where the UN was told not to hire women -
                    but not nearly as far as it had gone in Afghanistan. Women were still going to
                    school, and there were not separate schools for women. The opposition leaders
                    were saying that women have a role in our society. It's quite different from
                    Afghanistan in that sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the interest of the United States in these
                    countries? Would Central Asian ambassadors get together and say, “Nobody pays
                    attention to us?” Or how did you feel about this? I'm talking from the
                    American-SMITH: Well, Central Asian ambassadors did get together periodically -
                    on our own. And I think the first two times we did it on our own, and the third
                    time somebody came out from Washington. But the first two times it was totally
                    on our own. I think we got a fair amount of attention. I personally didn't have
                    many complaints, because when you have a civil war or a former civil war, you
                    can get the press statement when you need it. You may not get the high-level
                    appointments, but they may not be appropriate anyway because of the nature of
                    the government. But you can get the press statement, and when you have an aid
                    project that you can really make an argument for as supporting the peace
                    process, you can get the money for that. In November of 1997, in Vienna, I sat
                    down with the deputy from ESNIS-C, which is the part of ESNIS that coordinates
                    our assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ESNIS is that division of the Department that does

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The newly independent states. And ESNIS-C is the one that oversees the
                    assistance which we provide the newly independent states; and most of that goes
                    through AID, but not all of it. And we just sat down and we wrote the aid budget
                    for Tajikistan to get the money that I felt we needed for these projects which
                    supported the peace process. We had an AID representative in that meeting, but
                    the three of us just sat down, and we wrote it in Vienna.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the rationale for the United States being
                        concerneabout he peace process in a place way in the middle of Central
                        Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: The rationale was not specifically about Tajikistan but about the effect
                    of what was going on in Tajikistan and what effect that could have elsewhere.
                    The threat of this conflict, particularly with the Islamic fundamentalist
                    aspects of it, spilling over into the neighboring part of Central Asia was quite
                    a concern. And right now, you may have noticed that recent articles about the
                    problem in Kyrgyzstan - well, these are people who were in Tajikistan. They were
                    Uzbeks who were in Tajikistan and trying to go back to Uzbekistan and were
                    caught trying to traverse Kyrgyzstan and took some hostages and had a standoff
                    there. That's a small-scale example. But a real concern that if this is not
                    successfully solved you will have a spread of the problem to elsewhere in the
                    former Soviet Union. And of course, the way we would phrase it was that our
                    objective is to see Tajikistan successful as an independent, economically
                    viable, and democratic state. That says a lot of different things, but it also
                    says that the Soviet Union won't be reestablished in a different guise in this
                    part of Central Asia, which just has to be another thing at the back of our
                    minds.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Q: By the time you left there, did you feel that Tajiki spirit or something had
                    taken hold - it was no longer a possibility of a recreation of the Soviet Union,
                    as far as this Central Asian country was concerned?</p>
                <p>SMITH: There certainly were people in Tajikistan still who looked back to life in
                    the Soviet Union as having been better, and therefore would have liked to return
                    to it. However, for the same reason that they were interested in it, the
                    Russians were not interested - in the sense that to have that better life
                    required a transfer of resources from Moscow, and that was the last thing that
                    the Russians wanted to do. However, on the other side, certainly the institution
                    of a successful independent government of Tajikistan had been much more
                    established by the time I left, and with all of the equities that various
                    players get in that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: And a new generation was growing up, I suppose. What about a feeling of “We
                    want Samarkand and Bukhara,” and that sort of thing? Was there a feeling of
                    -</p>
                <p>SMITH: This is something that observers like to toss out and the Uzbeks like to
                    mention as a potential source of problem. You didn't really hear very much of
                    that. Occasionally, there would be some reference to it in a statement often
                    used - Uzbekistan and Tajikistan sort of needling each other, Uzbekistan
                    president Karimov would say something like, “The president of Tajikistan
                    shouldn't forget who put him on the throne, since Uzbekistan had helped the
                    current government win the civil war, and the president of Tajikistan then
                    replied something that, you know, “We might have to reconsider our policy on
                    various things.” But not very much discussion of that. There are certainly
                    stellar links, particularly to Samarkand - there are groups in Tajikistan who
                    are known in Samarkand, who just go back and forth to Samarkand. There are some
                    people there who do feel strongly about this issue, one of whom was on a
                    commission of national reconciliation, and the Uzbek community saw his presence
                    there as a potential problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about ties - is there a lot of travel back and

                <p>SMITH: A lot of travel, but it's very hard, because the Uzbeks are very tough at
                    the border, and it's a constant source of friction with the Tajiks. It's very
                    hard to get across that border.</p>

                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, the Uzbeks say it's because they're concerned with narcotics flows
                    and things like that. In fact, I think that it's because Pakistan, after having
                    helped the government win in 1992, has never been happy about its degree of
                    influence over the government and has therefore, in various ways, periodically
                    done things to remind the government of the Uzbek strength, either by
                    controlling the border, cutting off gas supplies - things like that. There are
                    no air flights between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
                <p>Q: Really? Were there still signs of the old Soviet almost 'shakedown' system of
                    roadblocks with police? If you try to travel around, they'd stop you, and if you
                    weren't an official car or something, a little money would change hands and that
                    sort of thing?</p>
                <p>SMITH: That's right. Their idea of control was roadblocks. And roadblocks, in
                    many or most cases, were in fact revenue-raising operations, and some of them
                    very explicitly so.</p>

                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>SMITH: I've actually written article that appeared in Central Asian Survey, the
                    last number, which gave my opinion about the peace process. In fact, the peace
                    process in Tajikistan, compared to some other peace processes, had been
                    relatively successful, and certainly one of the lowest-cost ones around. Success
                    per dollars was quite high there. On the other hand, the peace process has been
                    late, behind schedule, and parts of it have not yet really been implemented.
                    It's hard to know whether they're going to succeed in really implementing it.
                    Right now the parliamentary elections, which were supposed to have happened last
                    year and now are supposed to happen early next year - the year 2000, which will
                    be, really, a year and a half behind schedule - and that will be probably the
                    best test of whether it's going to happen. They had made significant success.
                    The fighting stopped for the most part. The refugees came home from Afghanistan.
                    The opposition got in the government. The opposition leaders' families are in
                    Dushanbe. On the other hand, they haven't done everything else that they were
                    supposed to. The demobilization of opposition fighters really hasn't been
                    successful. And there is a significant problem that there are some elements that
                    are left out of the peace process, that were never part of the peace process.
                    And the way to engage those, we always argued, was to have early fair elections.
                    Those elections haven't occurred yet, and it isn't clear that when they occur
                    they're going to be timely enough or run fairly enough to really give those
                    elements that were left out a sense of participation. Plus, some of those
                    elements are significantly armed, and you have this whole problem of spoilers or
                    obstructionists. Some of them have significant interests, probably criminal or
                    trafficking drugs, that would mean that for them it's hard to show that peace is
                    enough of an incentive because they're doing quite well under the current
                    system. You know, in Angola, you have diamonds and oil, and it's very hard to
                    persuade the two sides that they're going to gain more by reconciling. In
                    Tajikistan, it's narcotics, with some individual obstructionists that can be a
                    major problem. But it has got along a lot farther than people would have
                    expected four or five years ago, and you have the opposition functioning in the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it had not reverted, as some of the ones did, to

                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>SMITH: There are some people who see the government operating that way, because
                    Rakhmonov is very much in charge, in the old sense. He has compromised with the
                    opposition on various issues, and the real question is going to be how it's
                    going to work out after these next parliamentary elections - how the
                    parliamentary elections are going to work and how it's going to work out. The
                    security situation is a continuing concern. Some of these obstructionists have
                    private armies, and they were responsible for the fighting in April-May of 1998;
                    and again in December of 1998, there was a shootout in the center of town in
                    front of the headquarters of the Commission of National Reconciliation. This
                    time two opposition group, and it sounds like the Wild West, except that now
                    they're using AK-47s, and three people were killed. Still there are parts of the
                    country where there are roads it isn't safe to use. As a matter of fact, the
                    road from Dushanbe to the east is still closed. There's one, I'd say,
                    obstructionist leader out there. There were four members of the UN mission who
                    were murdered out there in July of '98, and probably by somebody under the
                    control of this particular obstructionist leader. So it continues to be a
                    dangerous place. Operations at the embassy there were suspended after I left.
                    The reason was, I think, that there had been a continuing security concern
                    because of this Wild West atmosphere. You can imagine Washington getting reports
                    of fighting in the northern part of the city, fighting in the eastern part of
                    the city, incidents sometimes involving Americans (although none were killed),
                    plus some information that there were some specific threats, that people may
                    have been looking at us specifically. There was a Washington Times article, oh,
                    maybe a year and a half ago that summarized a lot of this stuff. So there had
                    been this ongoing security concern about Dushanbe, and beginning in September of
                    '97, I was riding around all the time in an armored car with a security detail
                    of one American and six or seven armed Tajiks from our own embassy guard force
                    whom DS [Diplomatic Security] had trained. So that was the background. Then in
                    July of 1998, first you had the attacks on our embassies in East Africa from Bin
                    Laden, who is there in Afghanistan; and then in August of 1998 we attack his
                    camp, and we knew that some of the opposition fighters had been trained in those
                    camps. We felt that they might feel a little bit sentimental. So there was
                    considerable security concern after the attacks in East Africa and our
                    retaliation. We were still on the top floor of the hotel. We didn't have an
                    independent site. We had begun work on an embassy building, but it wasn't going
                    to have two things. First of all, the first stage was going to be a temporary
                    building, which was not hardened at all, and secondly, it didn't have quite
                    sufficient setbacks. It was in the center of town. And they decided to suspend
                    operations of the embassy. So right now you have the Foreign Service nationals
                    working out of what had been our house. We gave up the top floor of the hotel
                    completely. They are working out of what had been our house. The ambassador, my
                    successor, is located in Almaty and comes down a couple of times a month, stays
                    in what had been the guest wing of the house, and does his business for a few
                    days and goes back. Other members of the staff come down periodically as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about narcotics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. When I was doing the narcotics job, I always used to explain to
                    people that every time we had seen a transit country, we had seen that there
                    were two threats to that country because of the transit of narcotics through the
                    country. One was consumption, because sooner or later you began to get
                    consumption in every transit country. And secondly, the influence of the
                    trafficking organizations on the government could in the most extreme result in
                    a government that was totally controlled by the trafficking organizations. And
                    in the case of Tajikistan, we saw both of these going on. First of all,
                    according to our statistics, Afghanistan is the second largest producer of opium
                    in the world. According to the UN statistics, it's the first largest, larger
                    than Burma. (we say it's smaller than Burma). The major growing regions are down
                    close to the Afghan border, near Kandahar in the Helmand region, but some is
                    grown in the north, a smaller crop is grown in the north in the Badakhshan
                    province of Afghanistan, adjacent to Tajikistan, and when I arrived, there was a
                    significant flow of opium from Badakhshan, Afghanistan, to Badakhshan in
                    Tajikistan, almost entirely in the form of opium. We did some calculations, and
                    you know you could - I'll try to remember the statistics now, but I think we
                    figured out that - these could be off significantly, but - if they produced 50
                    tons of opium in Badakhshan, Afghanistan, some of that was consumed there, but
                    say 40 tons came through Tajikistan. Each kilo you got a profit of $500. I think
                    that works out to something like $20 million profit for transiting Tajikistan.
                    That was at that time mostly - meaning 90 percent, were the estimates I heard -
                    going through the eastern part of Tajikistan, the Gorno-Badakhshan Province
                    there, on a road or other routes, up into Osh in Kyrgyzstan. I remember when I
                    first arrived I heard there was a Mercedes dealer in Osh. Well, you can imagine
                    what that Mercedes dealer is getting his money from.</p>
                <p>By the time I left, the trade had changed significantly, with probably 50 percent
                    of the flow across into the western part of the country and a significant
                    portion of that in heroin, not in the form of opium. We never were very sure
                    about whether there were labs in Badakhshan, Afghanistan, but surely some, if
                    not all, of that heroin was coming from the areas farther to the south, now in
                    fact controlled by the Taliban. So you had a very different situation. You had
                    not just opium but heroin, with much higher value, much more addictive, and
                    trafficking organizations tend to be much stronger. And most of this as coming
                    through the western part of the country, up to Dushanbe and then going off from
                    there, and with some of those private armies on the government side involved in
                    that traffic. We had people, not Americans, from one delegation who had been
                    down along the border and said you'd see these Tajik border forces down there.
                    The individual soldiers might not even have shoes, but the person in charge
                    might have a Mercedes or a BMW in his garage. Again, you can draw your own
                    conclusions. On the other hand, at least parts of the opposition in the eastern
                    part of the country, had been and probably still were involved in trafficking
                    through that area, with essentially what were private armies on their side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought this would be the place where DEA
                        would btrying to establish a presence. Was that in the cards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>SMITH: Well, first of all, DEA focuses on places with a direct relationship with
                    the United States, where it can make cases about traffic to the United States.
                    Everything which was going out of Tajikistan was, I think, almost all going to
                    Moscow. And certainly the pure opium, the raw opium, was for consumption in
                    Moscow. There was no market in the United States for opium. So DEA's direct
                    interest was somewhat less than it would be, let's say, in Thailand or even
                    Pakistan or Afghanistan. We tried to get DEA to visit on a lot of occasions,
                    unsuccessfully, to come in and give a basic narcotics course. DEA tends to like
                    to do things where there are five-star hotels, and we didn't have any, so we
                    didn't succeed in getting DEA. We did get Customs to come in and give a course.
                    Our focus was much more on getting the UN to take the lead and support the UN.
                    But even there we had a lot of trouble. The UNDCP did put together a project in
                    the eastern part of the country. It was very slow getting started, and we put
                    money into it, to control that road going up to Osh or to provide added controls
                    on that road going up to Osh. But even more than that, it needed an integrated
                    country-wide program. You needed international support for that. We had UNDCP
                    sort of ready to do it, but they move extremely slowly, and getting them to
                    visit-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNDCP-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: UN International Drug Control Program, based in Vienna. But it was very
                    hard to get them engaged there. The Tajiks had created an anti-narcotics
                    commission headed by somebody who was quite good, whom we brought to the United
                    States at one point. But getting the UNDCP engaged to do things was very
                    difficult. We were able to do some small things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in '98. Since we're in '99, I take it
                        yocame back here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes, I have been - still am - at the Peacekeeping Institute at the Army
                    War College in Carlisle. The Peacekeeping Institute is a think tank which
                    represents the peacekeeping issue within the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army's views
                    on it outside.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, could we talk just a bit about that, because this, in a way, seems to be
                    a major role now for the Army, isn't it? Or do they see it that way?</p>
                <p>SMITH: They see it that way. They are not entirely sure they like it because they
                    feel that their major mission is fighting and winning wars, and peacekeeping
                    without the added resources that they think are necessary detracts from that
                    major mission - that the units that do peacekeeping have to be trained for that
                    and then, when they're finished, retrained to bring them up to levels where
                    they're ready for ordinary kind of warfare. They're concerned that the equipment
                    they need for peacekeeping is different from the equipment they need for
                    fighting wars.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Q: Do you find, though, that you're seeing a sort of a new breed of officer, a
                    certain percentage, who are engaged in this, seeing this as one of the major
                    functions, such as field artillery officer or cavalry officer - that the
                    peacekeeping officer with languages, interpersonal skills, this type of thing,
                    is the wave of the future? Are you seeing a new breed?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, there certainly are officers who've served in Haiti and Bosnia who
                    have hands-on experience who are now rising to the top, General Shinseki being
                    an example; however, the specialists of the kind you mentioned would be from
                    their Civil Affairs, and they have not expanded. There have been recommendations
                    to do it, but as of yet I don't think they've significantly expanded their civil
                    affairs cadre, which means that since that's mostly reserved, a very small
                    active duty group, that those people are being worked very, very hard. There
                    hasn't been an effort to really expand, to improve their capabilities on that
                    side. The peacekeeping institute, you could say, is part of that, in the sense
                    that it is running seminars on peacekeeping issues for discussion within the
                    Army, doing education, participating in exercises, advising on preparation and
                    training of units to do peacekeeping.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I was just wondering. I mean you look at the Department of State and the
                    Department of Defense. Right now we're living through the Bosnia-Kosovo
                    experience, but I would think that this would be almost the wave of the future,
                    and I was wondering, do you feel that there's a cadre being built up both in the
                    Army and in the State Department who are going to be able to deal with this?</p>
                <p>SMITH: Well, certainly in the Army there is a group that has hands-on experience
                    now, and I was out at Fort Leavenworth earlier this year, where they run the
                    Command and General Staff College, and they said that the percentage of officers
                    who come in there who have hands-on experience has really risen to around 25
                    percent. So it affects the way these games go. And the seminars that the
                    peacekeeping- (end of tape)-the Peacekeeping Institute runs. The first one, I
                    understand, was extremely basic peacekeeping. The last one I attended, in June,
                    was a discussion of exit strategy, what needs to be accomplished before you can
                    leave and how do you accomplish that. This was a fairly sophisticated argument,
                    and most of the Army personnel there were people who had a lot of hand-on
                    experience, but there were some there who didn't, which was good too because
                    they were being introduced into these missions. Of course, the Army isn't the
                    only part of the U.S. military establishment with equities on peacekeeping. The
                    Marine Corps also-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Marine Corps, yes, as well as the Navy and the Air
                        Force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SMITH: - but the Marine Corps has a lot of interest, experience -Somalia being
                    the-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SMITH: Yes. They see themselves as a force that goes in but only for a brief
                    period. They see themselves as much shorter-term than the Army. But they're much
                    less ambivalent about it than the Army is. Because this is part of their
                    mission, they don't have all of those conflicting issues that the Army does.
                    They, in fact, say that they find that peacekeeping is excellent for individual
                    and small unit training, as opposed to large exercises. But the lower down
                    impact is very positive on training.</p>
