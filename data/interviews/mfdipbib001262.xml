                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 27, 1998, and this is an interview with
                        Philip C. Wilcox, Jr. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wonder if we could just start at the beginning. Could you tell me when and
                    where you were born and something about your family?</p>
                <p>WILCOX: I was born in Denver, Colorado, on February 21, 1937. My father was a
                    businessman, an employee of the Bell System, the telephone company, born in
                    Denver and worked there. During my early years we moved to New York where my dad
                    worked for the AT&amp;T in New York. Then we returned back to Denver where I
                    attended high school. My mother was born in El Paso, Texas, so our family had a
                    strong western background. When I finished high school in Denver, I went to
                    college at Williams College in Massachusetts, and then I went to the Stanford
                    Law School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well let's go back. We'll start in Colorado.
                        You went to grammar school there, or was that in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I went to grammar school in Colorado, but then we moved to Maplewood, New
                    Jersey, and I finished grammar school and went to junior high school there. We
                    then moved back to Denver where I attended public high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before you hit high school, what were your main
                        interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I was an ordinary kid who was interested in sports, and I liked to read.
                    My parents encouraged me to read and as a very young child I remember a map of
                    the world in our breakfast room. I had some sense of geography and of other
                    countries at a fairly early age. My mother was from El Paso; she spoke Spanish,
                    so there was a little bit of a Mexican dimension to our family.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a little young to be caught up in the news of
                        WWII, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I remember listening to the radio and hearing the announcement of Pearl
                    Harbor when I was four years old. I also vividly remember many years thereafter
                    the Korean War. We were swept up in that. With the help and encouragement of my
                    parents and teachers, I was somewhat aware of what was going on in the rest of
                    the world, even as a child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did your high school in Colorado. Where in
                        Colorado?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I went to East Denver High School. Denver, although it is deep in the
                    west, has always had kind of a cosmopolitan character and an interest in the
                    rest of the world. As a high school student, I attended World Affairs Council
                    meetings. I heard diplomats, including State Department officials, who visited
                    Denver and began to be more oriented toward foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in high school, what were your subjects of
                        greatest interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I read a lot, and I liked cars and skiing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things did you read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Oh, I liked adventure stories and historical novels, including those set
                    in exotic foreign countries. I maintain that interest today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still looking at the map?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, we always had a map somewhere in our house and an atlas on our
                    coffee table. My parents were interested and involved. We often had visitors at
                    our home from foreign countries, including visitors who came under the U.S.
                    Information Agency's program. A Turkish student lived with us for a year in
                    Denver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to Williams. You were there from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I was there from 1954 to '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What got you to western Massachusetts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: When I lived in New Jersey, I got to know the East Coast well, and I
                    discovered Williams. I decided, as a Denver boy, that it would be broadening to
                    leave Denver and go to college somewhere else, so I went to Williams. That
                    opened up the world for me, intellectually. I studied history and political
                    science, and got a good grounding in the history of Western Europe, the Soviet
                    Union. There were no courses at that time on Asia, Africa, or the rest of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Richard Newhall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: He was my professor of philosophy. Fred Schuman was my political science
                    professor. He had been exiled from the University of Chicago, and was a
                    marvelous teacher and a great scholar and articulator of power politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was class of '50 at Williams and a history major, so
                        these are people I know. I think a wonderful grounding. What was your
                        impression of Williams at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It was a terrific college because of the caliber of the teachers and the
                    students. There was an intimate relationship among students and faculty. That
                    indeed, was the vocation of the college, to teach. The college is physically
                    remote, in the mountains of Berkshire County, but it was not intellectually
                    isolated. People came from Washington and around the worlGeorge Kennan, John
                    Foster Dulles, and Henry Cabot Lodge, for example. There were a good many
                    foreign students. The mission of the college was to provide a broad liberal
                    education. You absorbed a lot by osmosis, by being there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was there, the faculty was relatively liberal and
                        the student body was relatively conservative. I don't know if that still
                        applied.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: That was true in my era too. It was during the Eisenhower years when
                    American students were not engaged politically, and it was a more inward looking
                    time in our history I think. The students, as I recall, were mostly Republicans
                    if they had given any thought to politics, and many of them hadn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Williams, you were taking history and
                        political science. Did you have any career in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I had vague thoughts about the Foreign Service even then, but I had no
                    career plans. I was not oriented. I visited Europe during one of my summers in
                    college, and I also spent a summer in Venezuela working in an oil field. My
                    uncle got me the job. He had moved to Caracas when he finished Dartmouth College
                    and Harvard Law School, to go into business with his classmate at Dartmouth,
                    Nelson Rockefeller. That adventure stimulated my interest in the rest of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any effort at recruiting while you were at
                        Williams for the foreign Service, particularly CIA, because CIA at that
                        time, Williams was sort of a prime hunting grounds I think, particularly in
                        my class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I don't remember any. I had two classmates who joined one or another
                    branch of the Foreign Service. Warren Clark joined the State Department and Jack
                    Platt joined the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In my senior year in 1958 I was at loose ends. So, like a lot of
                    undergraduates even then, I decided to go to law school which seemed a
                    reasonable option to prepare me to be a lawyer or something else. I went to the
                    Stanford Law School. I chose over Columbia because I thought it would be
                    broadening to live in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be '58-'61. How did you find the law
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Stanford was pleasant, with a beautiful campus. The curriculum and the
                    professors were rigorous. In some ways it was a trade school which required the
                    digestion of masses of law, but some courses put the law in a broader context. I
                    was not excited by the law, and began to think more about politics and foreign
                    affairs. That was a time of great ferment in the United States as we became more
                    deeply involved in Indochina, and of course, Kennedy was elected. In my third
                    year at Stanford, I felt I wasn't ready to go to work as a lawyer; I wanted an
                    adventure. One day I heard the Reverend William Sloan Coffin whom I had known
                    slightly at Williams</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Yale.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WILCOX: He came to Williams after Yale as chaplain for a year. He was an
                    energetic critic of the fraternity system, which was ultimately abolished at
                    Williams. When he spoke at Stanford, he was promoting teaching opportunities in
                    Africa with the African-American Institute. He had spent a summer building a
                    schoolhouse in Guinea and was enthusiastic about Africa. At about that time, I
                    heard President Kennedy give a speech on television at the Cow Palace in San
                    Francisco announcing the establishment of the Peace Corps. I was inspired and
                    excited by this. I was inspired and I applied for a teaching job in Sierra Leone
                    and was accepted. I was grateful that my parents, who had paid my tuition for
                    law school, encouraged me to do what I wanted to do. So, I went to Sierra Leone
                    for three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Sierra Leone from '61...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: '61-'63. I spent much of '63 wandering through East Africa after I left
                    my job in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the training for going to Sierra Leone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The training was minimal. The program was designed to place American
                    volunteers in teaching positions left vacant by African teachers who had quickly
                    joined the civil service after the departure of the British in Sierra Leone,
                    Nigeria, and Ghana. There was a week of indoctrination in Washington, including
                    a briefing at the State Department by Under Secretary Chester Bowles. The school
                    system in British West Africa in those days was a proper English style system
                    with an organized curriculum. My students had a decent elementary school
                    education. The medium was English, and it was possible to begin teaching and do
                    it adequately. But we had no training in pedagogy, and this was a shortcoming.
                    We were enthusiastic amateurs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not in the Peace Corps; you were part of
                        this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I was part of the African-American Institute program. I worked for the
                    government of Sierra Leone at the St. Andrews Secondary School in the provincial
                    town of Bo, which was run by American Wesleyan Methodists. In my second year, I
                    lived with newly arrived Peace Corps volunteers. There were ultimately scores of
                    them in Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how you saw Sierra Leone when you
                        arrived there, the country and the government and how things worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I had read a book by Graham Greene, The Heart of the Matter that was set
                    in Freetown during WWII. I stayed at the City Hotel, where Greene's protagonist,
                    Scobey, hung out, and noticed the same mosquito nets and cockroaches I had read
                    about. It appeared that the departing British had done a good job in Sierra
                    Leone. There was an educated group of civil servants, teachers, judges, and the
                    place seemed to work. I never imagined that 40 years later the country would
                    succumb to savage violence and fall to pieces. In retrospect, the impact of the
                    British was superficial, and the country reverted to tribal conflict.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the students fairly well disciplined and
                        interested in what they were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The students were disciplined and respected their teachers. They felt
                    privileged to be going to school, and their parents had sacrificed to pay their
                    fees. While they were not as well educated as American students of that age,
                    many if them went on to pass their “O” level high school certificates that
                    qualified them for the junior college level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have never served in Africa, but I understood that
                        various groups in west Africa are considered better at some things than
                        others. The Ibos are traders and that sort of thing. How about the people of
                        Sierra Leone, a small area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Sierra Leone is a tiny country with a mixture of tribes and one dominant
                    tribe, the Mende, and a small community in Freetown of “Creoles” who are the
                    descendants of freed slaves sent there in the late 18th century to create a
                    colony. This was a distinguished community during the 19th century. They were
                    Christians who established a tradition of education and they created the first
                    modern university in West Africa, Fourah Bay College. Creoles staffed the mid
                    levels of the British civil service in the Gold Coast, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
                    Ghana, and Gambia, and were often the lawyers and clergymen in those colonies.
                    Now they are a dwindling remnant, and the tribal Sierra Leoneans have taken
                    over, and many of them have left. I had the high honor of being admitted to the
                    bar of the State of Colorado by a Sierra Leonean magistrate, Christopher Cole,
                    who read me the Colorado oath in his wig and robes. The local bar were invited,
                    and we had a glass of sherry. Cole later became Chief Justice of Sierra Leone.
                    He invited me to join the bar of Sierra Leone, but I declined since I would have
                    been obliged to swear allegiance to the Queen of England, who was still the
                    Sovereign in Sierra Leone in those days, and to have eaten dinners at one of the
                    Inns of Court in London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were tribal matters a matter something you were aware
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Tribal affiliations were important and political parties were organized
                    along tribal lines, but there was peace in the country and then Prime Minister
                    Milton Margai was a decent man. There was a police force and a bureaucracy and a
                    judicial system that functioned. I arrived just a year after independence, and
                    the entire British infrastructure was still intact. I visited Liberia at the
                    time, and I was struck by how primitive and shabby it looked, in contrast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Peace Corps came, were they pretty much a mirror
                        image of what you all were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They Peace Corps volunteers were a diverse group, from all over the
                    country. They were enthusiastic, dedicated, and by and large had a positive
                    effect helping to staff a needy school system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the school system much different than the
                        American school system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It was more rigid. There was more emphasis on rote memorization the
                    syllabus in order to pass standardized exams. But the students were forced to
                    learn the basics of literature, mathematics, geography, English, history, a bit
                    of science. As Americans, we wanted them to be more African than British, so I
                    introduced a course in African History that was an option in the syllabus, as an
                    alternative to English history. I became interested in the subject, and
                    discovered there was an interesting history of West African nation states and
                    rather refined civilizations that long predated the colonial era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point was there any inquisitiveness on the part of
                        the Sierra Leonean students about race relations in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Very little. The west Africans had no grievances against Americans or
                    white people. The British ruled through a handful of colonial officials who
                    relied heavily on the traditional chiefs, and because the climate was so
                    pooSierra Leone was known as the White Man's Grave, there were no British
                    settlers and no British women. So, there wasn't any racial undercurrent, nor was
                    there much awareness of American society or history, although President Kennedy
                    was much admired. There were a few black American volunteers, but we all found
                    Sierra Leone a very different kind of society than ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WILCOX: We invited Ambassador Carnahan (an ex-Congressman from Missouri) to speak
                    at a graduation ceremony, and I had regular contact with embassy officers,
                    especially Larry Williamson. I think those contacts helped steer me toward the
                    Foreign Service later. I traveled widely in East Africa.</p>
                <p>After I left Sierra Leone, I flew to East Africa and hitchhiked around for about
                    four months, and I met Jay Katzen, an American embassy officer in what was then
                    called Usumbura. He and his wife were very hospitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jay is a big politician now in Virginia politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did the Cold War intrude at all from your perspective during this time?</p>
                <p>WILCOX: One of the reasons for Washington's interest in the newly-independent
                    states of Africa was the hope that they would be friends and allies in the
                    struggle with the Soviet Union and the communists. We paid a good deal of
                    attention to these countries and launched significant aid programs. Both
                    President Kennedy and Soapy Williams, his Assistant Secretary of State for
                    African Affairs, were genuinely interested in the new continent. There was a
                    sense of hope and euphoria about the future of Africa in those days as these
                    countries became independent. In light of their later history, this optimism was
                    mistaken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you caught in that sense of excitement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Very much so. Africa was fascinating and exotic, the people were
                    friendly, and it was absolutely safe. You could travel anywhere. After a year
                    there I bought an old Land Rover for $125 and with two friends, drove to Nigeria
                    via Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, and Dahomey, all the way to Lake
                    Chad. It was a marvelous adventure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Nigeria and other places? Did you get a feel
                        for the situation, governments, society there was different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: All the West African countries had recently become independent. They
                    seemed to have decent infrastructure and functioning governments, and to be
                    moving forward. The great political debate, in those days was whether there was
                    something unique about African culture that predisposed them toward or required
                    one party government. We had no premonition of the internecine violence, civil
                    wars, and the gross corruption and breakdown that occurred 15-20 years
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>In East Africa, the atmosphere was different. The people were more reserved and
                    less forthcoming, and I sensed some racial tension, perhaps because of the large
                    colonial settler presence in some of those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Kenya, of course, there was the Mau Mau movement or was
                        it that far back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It took place earlier, while the British were still there. Even so, as I
                    hitchhiked all over East Africa. The people were friendly, the towns and cities
                    were attractive, and the countryside was beautiful. The only trouble I
                    encountered was in Kivu Province in the Eastern Congo, where the “Simba”
                    rebellion was already brewing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were up into '64, were you beginning to
                        get some ideas about what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I went home to Denver and joined a large and successful law firm, Holme,
                    Roberts &amp; Owen, where I became involved in probate, estate planning and tax
                    law. I gradually realized that my heart was not in it, and seemed quite prosaic
                    after by my experience in Africa. The only excitement I found in law practice
                    was a few times I served, pro bono, as defense counsel for indigent criminal
                    suspects, one of whom was a bank robber. But, lacking inspiration or commitment,
                    I took the Foreign Service Exam and passed it.</p>
                <p>My most important accomplishment during that period was my marriage, in 1965, to
                    Cynda Buxton, who also grew up in Denver and went to Stanford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I met her in the home of Dick and Dottie Lamb at a meeting of the Denver
                    Young Democrats to stuff envelopes for Lyndon Johnson. I was a member of the
                    board of the Young Democrats at the time, Dick was the President. Dick later
                    became Governor of Colorado.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take the Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I took it in the winter of 1965. When I passed, we agreed to go to
                    Washington, and I quit my law firm job in the late fall of 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the oral exam?</hi>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WILCOX: When I took the oral exam in Denver, the three Foreign Service Officers
                    on the panel impressed me. They asked some very penetrating questions, including
                    my opinion about the Vietnam War. I said I thought it was a mistake, and one of
                    the examiners agreed with me, to my surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any other things that were put to

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They asked me about how the U.S. government worked and what was important
                    about the formulation of foreign policy and the respective roles of the
                    executive branch, the Congress, and the press. They asked me lots of questions
                    about myself and my past. They were skillful interviewers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you passed both the written and the oral. When
                        did you come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Cynda and I came to Washington in late November 1966, and went to what is
                    called the A-100 course for junior officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came into the A-100 course, can you characterize
                        the class you were with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They were a diverse group from all over the United States and many
                    different backgrounds. Most of them I think were a bit younger than I was at the
                    time. But, as I had, many of them had experience in working elsewhere. Most had
                    been to graduate school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about minorities, women in your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There were, as I recall, only two women in my class, Arma Jane
                    Szczepanski, and Diane Salisbury (she married Bill Salisbury, another
                    classmate.) I don't think there were any African-Americans or other minorities
                    in the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got in, what was sort of the conventional wisdom
                        you were picking up in the corridors of power of where you wanted to go,
                        what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I told a personnel counselor I would like to go to Venezuela where I had
                    experience, had some family, and that I spoke a little Spanish. He said, “We'll
                    just take that off the list.” The odd implication was that would somehow be a
                    distraction or conflict of interest. I was assigned to Vientiane, Laos, and
                    detailed to the U.S. Information Agency [USIA]. I was very disappointed because
                    my vision of the Foreign Service was diplomacy and being a State Department
                    officer. So, I went to the coordinator of the course, Tom Dunnigan, and
                    complained to him. He said, “Young man, there are many different elements in our
                    Foreign Service. They are all equally important. We have a tradition of service,
                    and if you don't want to be assigned to USIS [U.S. Information Service], you can
                    do something else in your career.” Later, I understood that was very good advice
                    later. The Vientiane job with USIS turned out to be a marvelous assignment, one
                    of the most interesting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We were in Laos 1967 to '69, in the midst of the Indochina war. I served
                    under Ambassadors Bill Sullivan and G. McMurtrie Godley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two of the top people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: And I had the good fortune of having two jobs. I started out as a Field
                    Operations officer in USIS. Then, when the Press Officer, a veteran Foreign
                    Service officer, left unexpectedly, the Ambassador asked me to be the Press
                    Officer. It was an absolutely fascinating job, and I learned a lot.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Yes, Cynda went with me, and our daughter, Elizabeth, was born in Bangkok
                    in 1968.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Laos was a beautiful little Asian country. The people were charming; the
                    culture was quaint and exotic. The country was overwhelmed by a massive American
                    presence, since it had become an adjunct of the war in Vietnam.</p>

                    of victory over the Vietnamese communists and their Lao puppets, the Pathet Lao.
                    I wrote soft propaganda and what were called USINFOs, which were news reports
                    with a policy slant designed for the USIA wireless file, which went around the
                    world, for placement in local newspapers to win support for U.S. policy. Laos
                    was a valuable education. With the benefit of hindsight, the USIS mission there,
                    to make a tiny passive little country into an aggressive ally against the
                    Vietnamese, was unrealistic. The larger U.S. mission in Laos was to use the
                    country to vector bombing by U.S. Air Force planes based in Thailand against the
                    Ho Chi Minh Trail, and to stage ground attacks against the North Vietnamese
                    along the border, using Lao irregulars trained and armed by the CIA. The Ho Chi
                    Minh Trail was a major logistics route and supply line for North Vietnamese
                    forces and the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. In the end, this bombing campaign did
                    not stop the flow of arms to the South. We had hundreds of Americans in Laos.
                    The majority of them were involved in the paramilitary or military efforts, but
                    we also had a significant economic development and currency stabilization
                    program, run by the U.S. Agency for Economic Development [USAID]. We invested
                    vast sums of money without much knowledge of the history and culture of Laos,
                    and I believe, with unrealistic expectations about rescuing Vietnam from the
                    communists or helping stop the war in South Vietnam. For me, being in Laos was a
                    sobering education in the limits of U.S. influence and military power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out into the field much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I did a lot. One of my responsibilities was to provide information to the
                    visiting press and the local press. The Saigon war correspondents would come to
                    Vientiane periodically to write Laos stories and I got to know a lot of them. I
                    found that an exciting, heady experience. My job was to provide them with
                    information but also to steer them away from a lot of clandestine activities,
                    which were going on at the time. In some ways I was an agent of misinformation
                    when I had to use Washington's boilerplate press guidance. For example, the
                    prescribed line on our military activity in Laos was that we were “conducting
                    armed reconnaissance flights, and U.S. pilots were instructed to fire if fired
                    upon.” In fact, we were bombing the hell out of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. But I
                    tried to be helpful in other ways.</p>
                <p>When journalists came to Laos, they always called on the Ambassador. Bill
                    Sullivan liked the press and understood the importance of trying to help them.
                    He always had me with him when briefing journalists. Listening to him was an
                    education because he was a superb diplomat and a very clever man</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The major lesson I learned from my work as Press Officer in Laos was that while
                    there are inevitable tensions between the U.S. Government and the press, a
                    policy of secrecy and disinformation ultimately fails. The press was resourceful
                    enough to learn what was really going on in Laos, and our unwillingness to be
                    candid probably contributed to the great loss of credibility the U.S. Government
                    experienced as a result of our Indochina venture. Our ostensible reason for not
                    discussing our activities in Laos was that we were violating the Geneva
                    Convention, negotiated by Averell Harriman with the Soviets, which agreed that
                    Laos would remains neutral in the Vietnam conflict. Since the Vietnamese had
                    flagrantly violated Laos' neutrality, we probably should have determined that
                    the Geneva Convention was moot, and admitted what we were doing there.</p>
                <p>I remember when Charley More of the New York Times told me, after I had recited
                    to him the usual press guidance, that some day the United States would pay a
                    price for its unwillingness to level with the public about what was going on in
                    Laos and elsewhere in Indochina. He was right. Our policy of less than full
                    candor ultimately created a backlash and a loss of credibility that hastened the
                    decline of public support for our involvement in Vietnam and hastened our
                    departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling among particularly the junior
                        officers of which you were one about that whole business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I can't speak for officers, but I think we all felt we were part of a
                    cause, and there was a strong sense of commitment. Laos was a victim of North
                    Vietnamese aggression, and we thought it deserved support. Before joining the
                    Foreign Service, I had become skeptical about our involvement in Vietnam, but my
                    views were not fully formed at that time. I did think at the time that the U.S.
                    should be working harder to encourage a political solution in Vietnam, attempt
                    to bring the Viet Cong into the government as a way of separating them from the
                    North Vietnamese, and that we were relying to heavily on military means. In any
                    case, working in Laos and being part of a team was exciting and challenging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression about how Sullivan dealt with his
                        staff and then also Godley?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Sullivan was a man of powerful intellect, and strong views. He followed
                    our diplomatic and military efforts very closely in Vietnam, and he was never
                    shy about offering his advice to Washington or to Saigon. He did so regularly in
                    pithy telegrams, and made some enemies among those who felt he was meddling.
                    Nevertheless, he was committed to the broad goals of our struggle in Vietnam,
                    and later when he became a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the East Asia bureau.
                    In any case, he was a very able diplomat, a skilled political analyst, a great
                    raconteur, and a strong leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Sullivan was also a thoughtful man. Once he asked me to escort two journalists to
                    Xieng Khouang Province in northern Laos where they wanted to do a refugee story
                    for Life Magazine. He told me to avoid exposing the journalists to any of the
                    clandestine activities we were conducting in that area. I went to the person who
                    was supposed to plan the itinerary for our helicopter flight. We flew up to a
                    top of a mountain where the journalists had a wonderful time photographing
                    colorful Meo refugees streaming up the hillsides and getting into helicopters.
                    To my great shock, suddenly a U.S. Air Force F-4 bomber flew directly overhead
                    and dropped its ordinance seven or eight miles down the valley. Because of
                    faulty directions, we had strayed into a forbidden area. I was terrified that my
                    two journalist charges were going to rush back and report an eye witness
                    exclusive of the “secret war in Laos,” bringing to an early close my career in
                    the Foreign Service. To my amazement, they did not. One of them wrote the story
                    about six months later with a dateline of Hanoi after knowledge of our bombing
                    activity had become much more public. I went to Sullivan and told him what had
                    happened. He was annoyed, but there were no recriminations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Godley?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I didn't know Mac Godley as well. He was in some ways a more traditional
                    Foreign Service officer of the old school. I liked him a lot. When I was getting
                    ready to leave, he offered to help me on my next assignment and through him I
                    was assigned to Sri Lanka, although the Department abolished the position before
                    I got back to Washington. Godley was close to the CIA, and hired his former
                    Station Chief in Kinshasa to join him in Vientiane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the CIA and its activities and
                        its personnel in Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was a massive program to train and supply Lao irregular forces. The
                    officers I knew were talented, dedicated people people. There was a pronounced
                    division between the overt political side of the embassy and the clandestine
                    side, which I thought was excessive and unhealthy, although both Sullivan and
                    Godley were strong managers who watched everything closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the royal family of Laos? From your
                        perspective, was that much of a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The Royal family was respected, but the monarchy didn't have the kind of
                    dynamic leadership that for example, the Thai King had. The country was governed
                    more indirectly by a kind of feudal civilian military aristocracy. There was a
                    lot of drug running going on. An acquaintance of ours, Chao Sopsaisana, who was
                    a prince from Xieng Khouang, was appointed ambassador to Paris, but was arrested
                    by the French police on is arrival for attempting to smuggle in drugs in his
                    briefcase! Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma was a Lao prince from an old noble
                    family, and ironically, his half brother, Souphanouvong, who was known as the
                    Red Prince, was the nominal head of the Pathet Lao, the Lao Community Party that
                    was controlled by Hanoi. Souvanna Phouma, was a patriot who was trying to
                    preserve his country's independence from the Vietnamese and maintain at least a
                    veneer of neutrality.</p>
                <p>The Lao were not equipped nor prepared for the massive Vietnamese assault nor the
                    large U.S. presence there. They more or less stood aside while the U.S. took
                    over, and their own regular army was corrupt and ineffective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflections from people you know
                        about what was happening in Vietnam itself, whither Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, we would read the cables and we would read the press, so we had a
                    pretty good sense of what was going on next door. In a way I regretted that I
                    never visited Vietnam to see it myself. We felt we were a part of that
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left there, what was your impression in
                        '69?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, as I said, I was growing more skeptical about the whole enterprise,
                    but I hadn't really developed an ultimate view of our involvement. It was not
                    going well, and even then I thought that there ought to be more emphasis on
                    finding political solutions both in Laos and in Vietnam. My impression at that
                    time was that South Vietnam was still a viable entity, and it could emerge in
                    some way without being swallowed up by the North. I was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of us were. Well, when you left in '69, you were
                        going to go to Sri Lanka when they cut you off at the legs. Where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I went to work for the Deputy Undersecretary for Management, Bill
                    Macomber, who was a wonderful character. He had tremendous energy, commitment,
                    patriotism, and knowledge of U.S. government. He had been John Foster Dulles'
                    special assistant, and his wife, Phyllis Bernau Macomber had been Dulles'
                    secretary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I did it from 1969 to 1971. Being back in Washington, I could observe the
                    political ferment here in the United States over the war. I remember vividly
                    taking a bus to work from my home in Glover Park one morning. The bus was
                    hijacked by a group of anti-Vietnam protesters during the attempted closure of
                    the U.S. government. During those few days, I remember watching from our seventh
                    floor window in Macomber's office a gathering mob outside of the entrance of the
                    Department on C Street. Bill Macomber went down, and when he saw that the mob
                    was threatening to attack the American flag, he mounted the flag pole and
                    defended the flag. Some days later, he was at lunch on the seventh floor, and
                    the phone rang. The operator said it was President Nixon calling Bill Macomber.
                    I ran upstairs and got him from the dining room. In those days, it was quite
                    legitimate to monitor phone calls or principals, a custom that was later
                    abolished when it was abused. The President said, “Bill, I want to tell you I
                    thought it was a great thing you did the other day when you went out there and
                    saved the flag.” By then I had become increasingly disillusioned about our
                    engagement in Vietnam, but I was not so much involved in foreign policy as in
                    staff work and management issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William Macomber had a real vision for the State
                        Department and the Foreign Service and how it should be run, and there were
                        lots of proposals and follow through and all that. Could you talk about
                        Macomber and how he was dealing with these things, and what was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: After an unsuccessful run for a Congressional seat, Bill Macomber worked
                    for Mr. Dulles, and then became our Ambassador to Jordan and later Assistant
                    Secretary for Congressional affairs before he became Deputy Undersecretary for
                    Management. He had a great commitment to and love for the Foreign Service, and a
                    belief in American diplomacy and in the United States. Although he was a
                    political appointee, he believed in the Foreign Service and he wanted to improve
                    it. So, he launched an ambitious reform program called Reform '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Diplomacy for the '70s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. He saw the Department of State playing a leadership role and he
                    advocated better training and coordination. He got talented officers involved in
                    a series of task forces, recruiting Allen Holmes, an FSO who ended his
                    distinguished career as an assistant secretary of defense. I was the junior
                    person in the office as a staff aide. I learned a lot from Macomber about
                    government, the Department, and the art of staff work. It was a marvelous
                    job.</p>
                <p>Macomber deserves special credit for changing the policy at State that required
                    female Foreign Service Officers to resign if they married. He took up the case
                    of Katherine Shirley in Warsaw who was asked to resign after marrying Jock
                    Shirley of USIS. Macomber got her reinstated and changed the policy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about working as a staff assistant?
                        What type of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Good staff work should relieve the burden of work for your principal by
                    making modest judgments yourself when you can, and ensuring paper work is
                    polished and manageable. At that time at State, there was a great premium on
                    letter perfect paperwork and good drafting. I did lots of editing and
                    correspondence, and worked very closely with the Executive Secretariat which in
                    those days was staffed by an elite corps of young officers who made sure that
                    the paperwork flowed smoothly and was in proper shape for the principals. That
                    was of professional value to me, but just knowing how government policy worked
                    from the inside was good also. I also got a sense of congressional affairs
                    because Bill Macomber knew the Congress well and the importance of keeping it
                    involved and informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about the time when there was a fairly strong
                        movement on the part of junior officers who considered they were more
                        important than ever. This was a time when youth was felt to be without sin
                        and of particular value. Did you watch this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I watched closely. It was a product of our era, I think, and it expressed
                    itself one day when a large group of officers signed a petition condemning the
                    U.S. military invasion of Cambodia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: This provoked a demand from John Dean in the White house, who later
                    became famous as one of the minor actors in the Watergate scandal, to deny
                    promotions to the officers who signed the petition or perhaps deal even more
                    severely with them. Bill Macomber and his colleague Undersecretary for Political
                    Affairs U. Alexis Johnson intervened and defended the institution of the Foreign
                    Service. They didn't praise or agree with the officers' petition, but they
                    respected their right to dissent and were determined to protect them from
                    reprisals from the White House. This took courage.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: William Butts Macomber.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was renowned for his temper. Did you ever see this in
                        action?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I saw it, but he did not vent that temper on me. He was also a charming
                    man with a large circle of friends. I felt that sometimes people who didn't now
                    him had an unbalanced impression of him because they had experienced his hot
                    temper without really knowing the man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of weight do you think he carried within the
                        department at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I don't know. State suffered in those days from severe competition
                    between the National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, and Secretary William
                    Rogers. Macomber's reforms were supported by Secretary Rogers, but I think like
                    all secretaries of state, he was so preoccupied with foreign policy crises that
                    he did not devoted a lot of energy to resource, personnel, or management issues.
                    He left it to Macomber because he trusted him and they knew he was an able man.
                    Macomber was also quite good with the Congress. He dealt effectively with Wayne
                    Hays who was a tough, mean guy, serving as Head of the Government Operations
                    Committee of the House Appropriations CommitteeMacomber won his cooperation. He
                    also dealt with John Rooney, the chairman of another appropriations subcommittee
                    who had a reputation of being tough on the Foreign Service, calling us cookie
                    pushers. In fact John Rooney always came through with adequate budget funds for
                    State, after some posturing, and Macomber helped that process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find you got a pretty good feel for who was
                        doing what to who and how it was done in your department as a staff
                        assistant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I found it fascinating and learned a lot about how the Department worked
                    which helped me later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes because I think this is one of the things that those
                        who have let's say line jobs of being a desk officer and all don't quite get
                        the same feel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well there is a trade off. I never served as a country desk officer until
                    I became director of a country desk, so I think maybe I missed something earlier
                    in my career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Henry Kissinger intrude at all into your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No, he really didn't. He was indeed running our foreign policy from his
                    office in the White House. George Bush was our permanent representative to the
                    UN [United Nations] in those days, and he and Bill Macomber were old college and
                    prep school pals. During his visits to Washington to attend cabinet meetings, he
                    would always come in and say hi to everybody. He struck me as a friendly,
                    engaging fellow.</p>

                        Indonesia, did you take any Indonesian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I spent six months learning Indonesian at the Foreign Service Institute
                    (FSI). Cynda and I had the great good fortune to continue our language study
                    near Bandung, West Java, where we lived in a village and studied under tutors at
                    the local teacher training. Formal language training at FSI and further study in
                    the country of assignment, somewhere removed from the embassy, is an ideal
                    combination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '72, Indonesia, what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The country had emerged from the turmoil of the Sukarno era, the
                    challenge of the Indonesian communist party, and the overthrow the Sukarno
                    regime by the military. It had developed a considerable degree of stability and
                    prosperity under President Suharto and a group of talented, largely American
                    trained, technocrats who were running the macro side of economic policy. The
                    country was rich in oil and natural resources, but it was an underdeveloped
                    country, burdened by fast growth of its large population, considerable poverty,
                    a lack of modern legal and financial institutions. There was also deep
                    corruption, in which Suharto and his family were much involved. As a political
                    officer, I reported on corruption in detail and wrote some long dispatches of a
                    kind that are no longer written.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was corruption a concern and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We viewed it as a constraint to economic development, public support for
                    the government, and development of a market economy. At that time, it had not
                    reached the crisis stage, since there was plenty of money to go around, oil and
                    gas production and foreign investment were was growing, and the economy was
                    expanding. There was some student disaffection, but it wasn't serious. Nothing
                    like the '65 era or nothing like what is going on now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the problems of all of us who have served
                        in countries where there is a lot of corruption are faced with is the fact
                        that yes there is corruption, if you report on it, the reports taken out of
                        context can get you into newspapers and into Congress, and end up by being a
                        major focus and almost a detrimental effect to relations because Americans
                        love scandal, and if there is scandal, when are you going to do something
                        about the bums.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WILCOX: In those days there was less of a tendency to leak to the press. There
                    were fewer people who had personal agendas, and Congress was not as involved in
                    foreign policy. They had a greater respect for the leadership of the executive
                    branch and the Department of State. We didn't protest to Indonesia about
                    corruption. We were only beginning to discuss with them problems of human
                    rights, and that was considered a departure from traditional diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Frank Galbraith was my first ambassador. He was an old Indonesian had who
                    had served there for a good part of his career, spoke the language, and knew
                    everybody in the country. He was succeeded by David Newsom, a truly
                    distinguished person, a fine diplomat, and a scholar and writer who had
                    previously served in the Middle East, Africa and the Subcontinent. He had been
                    Assistant Secretary for African Affairs before he went to Jakarta. He had a
                    great influence on me because of his knowledge, wisdom and sense of integrity.
                    He understood there were certain limits to what you could and what you couldn't
                    do. He was a very good ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Indonesian
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Invariably pleasant. They place a premium on good personal relations and
                    courtesy. It was not easy to communicate with Indonesians without understanding
                    their culture. They dislike confrontation and their politeness often masks their
                    real views, so finding out what they were really thinking and what was going on
                    was real challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how they viewed the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They were friendly toward the United States and quite pro-western. We had
                    large AID and military support programs, and we supported the Suharto government
                    as a welcome change to the radicalism and instability of the former Sukarno era.
                    We recognized Indonesia's strategic importance because of its size and
                    geographic position, and because it was the fifth most populous country in the
                    world. The Indonesians have a deep love for their country and their own culture.
                    They also have a sense of nationalism forged during the colonial era and their
                    armed struggle that ultimately ended the Dutch occupation. Although there was
                    some latent xenophobia, it was far less pronounced than in some other former
                    colonial countries. The Indonesians maintained their culture and traditions
                    during the Dutch era, and Dutch respected this, although colonial rule was harsh
                    in some respects. The Indonesians are a proud people, and their contact with the
                    West has not created an identity complex.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, East Timor was emerging as an issue. We began to be concerned about
                    their heavy-handed approach toward the Timorese, after the Portuguese pulled
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the situation towards Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Suharto restored good relations with Malaysia, and ASEAN, the Association
                    of Southeast Asian Nations was beginning to prosper. The old days of
                    “confrontasi” with the Malaysians were over. Relations with the Singaporeans
                    were also correct. Their main problem was China. There was a fear of Chinese
                    domination, in part because it was communist, and in part because of prejudice
                    against the very large and prosperous Chinese community in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to be a community when things are bad there is a
                        pogrom. They sort of turn on the Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Chinese in Indonesia, like other expatriate Chinese were successful
                    entrepreneurs. The Indonesians in general do not have a commercial,
                    entrepreneurial tradition, and so there is quite a difference in the standard of
                    living. In times of trouble, indigenous Indonesians tended to blame their
                    economic problems on the Chinese. The problem was compounded by the penchant of
                    the Indonesian military leadership to use Chinese as front men and extract funds
                    from them as the price for allowing them to do business. Many Indonesian
                    leaders, including Suharto, were associated with wealthy Chinese who offered
                    them a percentage of their gains in return for licenses and franchises. Through
                    such associations, the Suharto family acquired an economic empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression in reporting on things of the
                        Suharto family and the circle around Suharto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We did a lot of candid, careful reporting, and there were never any
                    constraints or censorship. In those days we had rather large political and
                    economic sections, and we had the luxury of being able to report on a wide range
                    of topics. Bob Pringle, especially, was an unusually gifted analyst and
                    reporting officer. I also served as an Economic/Commercial officer for two of my
                    four years in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well as economic and commercial officer what were some of
                        the things you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I have always thought the Foreign Service has made a mistake in creating
                    separate cadres of economic and political officers. To understand politics and
                    economics, you have to be well versed in both subjects. I also think that
                    commercial work, trade promotion, and assistance to U.S. businessmen is an
                    important part of diplomacy. In the early 1970s, American Foreign Service
                    officers were beginning to take an interest in this and doing it quite well.
                    Many young officers had abandoned the traditional prejudice against commercial
                    work and found it quite interesting. In Indonesia, I found businessmen were
                    often more accessible, more interesting and more forthcoming than government
                    officials or ministry people. I was disappointed when the Department of State
                    under Secretary Vance decided to abandon the commercial function and hand it
                    over to the Department of Commerce.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Indonesians were bemused by what we regarded as high crimes and
                    corruption, since this sort of behavior was routine in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Greece, and it was the same thing. More
                        importantly, this was the period, '71-'75, we reached a truce in South
                        Vietnam, and then South Vietnam fell after a period of time. How was this
                        playing in Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Indonesians were disappointed that we didn't stay and defeat the
                    Vietnamese communists because they were deeply anti-Communist themselves, but it
                    did not have a major impact on our relationship or their confidence in us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were there, was it pretty well felt that

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was no support for the old communist party, and harsh prison
                    sentences against the older generation communist leaders was a signal that
                    support for communism was unacceptable.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I was concerned about the race between poverty and fast growing
                    population, although by then Indonesia, with U.S. help, had initiated a
                    promising family planning program. I was also worried about the cost of
                    corruption to stability and development. In retrospect, I was mistaken that
                    these problems could create crisis in the near term. In fact, Indonesia boomed
                    for another 20 years, before the problems of corruption, inequity, and lack of
                    institutional development finally caused an economic and political upheaval. Now
                    the country is in deep in trouble, and is searching for a way to move away from
                    military rule to democracy, and from crony capitalism to market economics. The
                    people now want more participation and more probity in government, although they
                    also want stability.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some time before, West Irian had been the great
                        rallying cry. You were there when Indonesia had West Irian. What was
                        happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Indonesians negotiated with the United Nations for a referendum
                    called the “act of free choice” by the people of what was then Dutch New Guinea.
                    The people opted to join Indonesia. The process was hardly democratic, and the
                    Indonesians contrived to be certain they would inherit the area, which they
                    named West Irian. The people of West Irian are among the most isolated, in the
                    world, and had not developed unity or a sense a nationalism to counter the
                    Indonesians.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They are profoundly non-modern. There was no prospect I think, of their
                    creating their own government. At the time, the Indonesians saw that as part of
                    their archipelago and took it over. Indonesian rule there has been rather harsh.
                    But I doubt that there is any feasible alternative to Indonesian control of
                    Irian Jaya for the foreseeable future. In the fullness of time, however, the
                    Irianese will demand to govern themselves and get rid of their Indonesian
                    colonial masters. Irian Jaya is a very wealthy area; the Indonesians recognized
                    that. I think they saw themselves as the natural heir to it. It had been part of
                    the Dutch empire. They have tried to settle Javanese there as part of their
                    transmigration policy, but it is an alien atmosphere. Most Javanese would rather
                    live in Java.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: The Japanese were becoming the dominant foreign investor. Indonesians
                    were not happy about the style of the Japanese that was sometimes insensitive,
                    but they understood the value of Japanese investment.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: There was some, but in contrast to many countries of the world, the
                    Indonesians who went abroad and studied usually came home because they loved
                    Indonesia. There was not an urge among young people to go abroad and stay, in

                        within our international student body here in the United States.</hi>

                <p>WILCOX: It is a little known country with an extraordinarily rich and interesting

                        prime source of Indonesian studies in the United States, Cornell? Because I
                        know that out of Cornell, I have gotten this in other interviews, Cornell
                        was sort of the premier study place for Indonesia and yet they didn't like
                        what happened when Sukarno was overthrown. At least I got this feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: George Kahan, Ben Anderson and others at Cornell were pioneers in the
                    study of Indonesia and influenced the views of a generation of Foreign Service
                    officers. They did a lot of their work during that period of ferment in the
                    mid-'60s, and a lot of their contacts were with young Indonesian students and
                    intellectuals. They disliked the military government of Suharto, and the feeling
                    was mutual. There has been very fine scholarship on Indonesia in Australia as
                    well. In those days there was lots of federal money in the U.S. to fund regional
                    studies. I'm afraid we don't have that any more. American scholars did a lot to
                    elucidate that country to Americans.</p>

                    They, I think, saw it as a setback. Indonesia is far from Vietnam. Their real
                    preoccupation was China, and keeping the Chinese at bay was their most important
                    strategic objective in Asia.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: The first oil shock, I believe, came, the boycott came in '73 after the

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think it raised the price of oil, and Indonesia was producing a large
                    volume of oil. A good deal was going to Japan. They had just discovered big
                    natural gas reserves, so they were beginning to produce LNG (liquefied natural
                    gas) and to build big petrochemical and fertilizer plants. The head of
                    Pertamina, the state oil company, was General Ibnu Sutowo, a major empire
                    builder and a crook. He diverted so much money from the company to build
                    satellite enterprises, and also to build golf courses and to enrich his friends
                    and family that he began to be seen as a threat to the rest of the army and the
                    leadership. The technocrats were worried too, since he was amassing foreign debt
                    at untenable level. So he was finally sacked and Pertamina was cut down to
                    size.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In 1976, I came back to Washington and entered the 26-week course in
                    Economics at the Foreign Service Institute. That was probably one of the best
                    things I ever did. It reinforced my views that all Foreign Service officers
                    should have a solid grounding in economics as well as politics. It was the
                    equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Economics. I think genuinely so, and it
                    is something I have used every day of my life since.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, and for me that was a great challenge because I never had gone
                    beyond solid geometry in high school. The most useful parts of the course were
                    in trade policy, basic economics, and money and banking. The econometrics and
                    the math were really unnecessary, since few Foreign Service officers used these
                    skills in their work.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: I was looking for an economic job in 1977, but Francis Wilson, the
                    Executive Director of the Economics Bureau told me it was not her practice to
                    hire political officers, even though I had taken the FSI course. I thought that

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, casting about for an assignment where I could use my new found
                    economics knowledge, I discovered that the job of head of the economics section
                    in Bangladesh was open, and officers were not exactly scrambling for that
                    position. I thought it would be interesting, so I applied and was assigned there
                    for two years, '77-'79.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Frances Wilson, no I didn't. I knew of her by reputation. She was a
                    formidable executive director, but she had a special fondness for officers who
                    came up through the economic cone, so instead of going to EB, I went to
                    Dacca.</p>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Dakha was coming out of a series of political convulsions following the
                    birth of Bangladesh, it's breakaway from Pakistan, and the Indian invasion. That
                    was a time of terrible chaos, violence and human suffering. In the mid-'70s,
                    there were also natural disasters which killed a lot of people. Thereafter, this
                    began to make progress. The United States and donors from all over the world had
                    focused on Bangladesh as a country with compelling development needs.
                    Development was the main element of U.S. policy. It was a desperately poor
                    country, about the size of Wisconsin with a dense population and a high rate of
                    population growth. The main goals USAID, the World Bank and other donors were
                    family planning, food production, public health, and job creation. I spent more
                    time working with USAID on their programs than on the traditional work of an
                    embassy economic officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Few American firms were interested in investing because of the poverty
                    and the country's history of socialism and expropriation of private property. I
                    got to know the Bangladeshi business community, which was struggling to overturn
                    the policies of state control established by the former government of Sheik
                    Mujibur Rahman, the first president of Bangladesh. Zia Rahman, his successor,
                    was working, albeit slowly, to change those policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that sort of the genes of

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Bangladeshis are a tough resilient, hard working people. In spite of
                    adversity, which is almost inconceivable to westerners who haven't seen it, the
                    Bangladeshis have actually made some progress. This wasn't readily apparent when
                    I was there, but 15 years later, Bangladesh has made real strides in producing
                    almost enough food to be self sufficient in privatizing a fair sector of their
                    economy, in raising income, and most important of all, in running an effective
                    family planning program to slow down a potentially catastrophic rate of
                    population growth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude towards family planning, because
                        particularly since the Reagan administration which came in in '81, abortion
                        has been considered, you know, we cannot support abortion. What was our
                        attitude in dealing with family planning at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Family planning was far less politicized in those days, and it was a
                    central plank of U.S. foreign policy in underdeveloped countries. USAID had very
                    experienced family planning experts, and did a superb job. I had seen it earlier
                    in Indonesia. The Congress was supportive, there was plenty of money, and
                    abortion was not a big issue. We supported voluntary sterilization in Bangladesh
                    at the time, but recognized this should be carried out without coercion, in
                    contrast to India, where coercive practices had set back family planning.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Ed Masters was there when I arrived, and David Schneider came later. Both
                    were solid professionals. While Ed Masters was still there during the early
                    months of my tour, a Japan Airlines flight was hijacked by a group of Japanese
                    Red Army terrorists and forced down at Dhaka. The airplane was carrying well
                    over 100 civilians including a good many Americans. In the course of negotiating
                    with the terrorists, an insurgent group of Air Force officers mutinied and
                    seized the airport, adding to the crisis. Because there were so many Americans
                    aboard this plane, we were very much involved in the process with the Bengalis
                    and the Bangladeshis to get the hostages released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? Were you involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, around the clock. We worked on the government to persuade the
                    terrorists to release the passengers without capitulating to their demands. They
                    did release some - perhaps all - of our citizens in Dhaka, but the terrorists
                    then forced the pilot to take the plane to Algeria where they abandoned it,
                    released the rest of the hostages in return for a very large sum, I think it was
                    $10,000,000, and disappeared. As a matter of policy, we opposed such ransom
                    payments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Both very experienced in the developing world. Ed Masters had served as
                    DCM in Indonesia. David Schneider was a premier South Asia expert, having served
                    in India and Pakistan repeatedly. They had a strong sense of the need for
                    economic development as the core of U.S. policy in Bangladesh, and they used our
                    considerable influence effectively to developing close relations with the
                    Bangladeshis and influence their policies. But it was not a tutelary
                    relationship. The Bangladeshis had an upper tier of elite civil servants. It was
                    an effective relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading on the Indian government vis a vis
                        Bangladesh at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The legacy of the past was still strong. The Bengalis are Muslims and
                    have had an historic rivalry with the Hindus in India. But the Indian invasion
                    in 1978 enabled Bangladesh to break away from Pakistan, so the relationship was
                    ambivalent. The Indians had a large embassy there. Relations were cordial, and
                    improving, but there was a latent fear about mother India because of its
                    enormous size. Both governments were making an effort to deal in a sensible way
                    with water. The water of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers were shared by both
                    India and Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they even have relations with Pakistan at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. There was both an animosity toward Pakistan and a kind of nostalgia
                    for the old days. Most of the Bangladeshi civil servants had grown up in the
                    civil service of Pakistan, and their classmates, or as they called them, “batch
                    mates,” were working in Islamabad and around the world, so there was a kind of
                    affinity. By that time, the Pakistanis were beginning to recognize that
                    partition was a good thing because Bangladesh, with its enormous weight of
                    population and its economic problems, and its cultural and ethnic differences
                    from the Pakistani communities was a very different and troubled country.
                    Moreover it was hundreds of miles away. I think the break up was an historical
                    inevitability. It is a pity it took place in such a violent way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any floods, typhoons or the like. They seem
                        to be endemic in that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We didn't have any of the catastrophes that strike Bangladesh now and
                    then. The country is extremely vulnerable to this kind of phenomenon because it
                    is basically a river delta at sea level. The Bay of Bengal is subject to
                    typhoons and hurricanes, and when they come, they sweep across the coastal areas
                    and kill or displace masses of people. There was a theory at one time that
                    periodic natural disasters would keep the population down, as nature's way of
                    population control. Modern medicine changed this. While a great many people lost
                    their lives in these disasters, the success of public health programs, including
                    smallpox and cholera inoculations, had long since ended nature's way of
                    maintaining a balance, and the population was soaring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How closely did you work with our AID effort there? The
                        assistance effort must have been huge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WILCOX: It was. Besides family planning, USAID promoted agriculture and
                    irrigation projects, including a massive program of building flood control
                    levees, usinU.S. surplus food as payment. This was called the PL-480 Title II
                    program. CARE, the private voluntary organization, ran the Title II program for
                    USAID. Another program was designed to reduce food subsidies in order to
                    increase agricultural production and income for farmers. Bangladesh, like many
                    poor countries, had a ration subsidy system. Our programs were designed to wean
                    them away from that so the market could operate. The food grain program USAID
                    ran also emphasized fertilizer, irrigation, and new varieties of hybrid wheat
                    and rice seeds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that much of our effort which had been
                        concentrated in South Vietnam not long before this, I mean the final pullout
                        was in '75, the expertise and knowledge would have sort of been switched
                        over to Bangladesh, a hot place in Southeast Asia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: A lot of well-qualified and dedicated USAID and other development experts
                    were drawn to Bangladesh because it presented a model challenge for economic
                    development. The middle class spoke English, and there was a coherent government
                    structure. It was a great country for, and as we have subsequently
                    learnesomething of a success story for - development assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about corruption; was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, and it was getting worse. I wrote reports on it. As in many
                    developing countries there were close family and political ties between the
                    business community and the bureaucracy and a good deal of corruption and back
                    scratching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It didn't taint our AID program, and the impact on development was not
                    crippling, so it wasn't part of our diplomacy then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about social life in dealing with the
                        Bangladeshis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It was spontaneous. The Bangladeshis are open and engaging people, and it
                    was easy to make friends there. The intelligentsia, including academics,
                    businessmen, and senior civil servants were interesting, accomplished people,
                    although a great many were emigrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much spillover into Calcutta, sort of the Bengal
                        area there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The Calcutta Bengali are Hindu and culturally different with respect to
                    religion. Many of the Hindu Bengali were forced out in the convulsions of the
                    late '70s and went to East Bengal in India. Some of the Muslim Bengalis had been
                    trained and went to prep school or university in Calcutta and were part of the
                    Bangladeshi Muslim elite. The Hindus who were expelled were poor people known as
                    the Biharis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About cultural life, you know I have never served in the
                        area, but I know the Bengali movie industry is sort of world renowned from
                        India and the poetry is supposed to be particularly good. Was there a
                        reflection in Bangladesh of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The people were proud of that tradition, but the real heart and flowering
                    of Bengali culture is in Calcutta and West Bengal where there was more wealth
                    and commerce and a more highly developed urban society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking as we were looking at developing
                        Bangladesh towards tying them in to this commercial center of Calcutta and
                        working on that or was this sort of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We encouraged regional cooperation, but at that stage, Bangladesh's main
                    export, foreign and commercial ties were with the Persian Gulf countries.
                    Migrant workers were the major source of foreign exchange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Persian Gulf.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis worked there and sent remittances
                    home. Bangladesh imported food grain from the U.S. and Canada in those days.
                    They exported jute, and were beginning to exploit their considerable natural gas
                    reserves. This activity has grown, but trade and business ties with their
                    immediate neighbors had not developed very much at that time. The Indians and
                    Bangladeshis are talking about using Bangladesh's oil and gas reserves for West
                    Bengal and perhaps building pipelines for that purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that hadn't developed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No. Gas has been used primarily for domestic energy needs. USAID also
                    started a program of rural electrification, which has been a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '79. Were you now a certified economic
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I went out there with a view that to be effective in understanding the
                    rest of the world and representing the United States, you had to have a grasp of
                    economics as well as politics. I was confirmed in that view by my experience in
                    Bangladesh. It was also a tremendous education living in that part of the world
                    which is utterly different from the west and where human beings faced with
                    incredible odds somehow cope, survive and sometimes thrive. It shows that even
                    with these burdens of population, there is still a way to generate economic
                    development and a better life for people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the Bengali sort of example being looked at do
                        you think by our government or any other governments saying “Okay, we can do
                        something in something like this?” What are we learning and passing on, or
                        was it country specific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In those days U.S. economic development assistance was still thriving. It
                    was very much a part of our foreign policy, and it got a lot of impetus from the
                    Cold War. It was seen as a strategic tool as much as a humanitarian endeavor, so
                    we had high levels of funding. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of
                    the Cold War, as you know, development assistance has declined drastically, and
                    it is struggling to preserve itself as a significant element of U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much carryover, I'm talking about the late '70s,
                        from the Bengali experience to other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, like everything else, development policy goes through different
                    cycles. Human rights, women's rights, and promotion of democratic institutions
                    get more attention today in our aid policy than previously. The lessons that we
                    learned in Bangladesh were that sensible and well-funded development assistance
                    programs can help a lot in family planning and food production. There is lots of
                    transferability there. A lot of the people who worked in those programs are now
                    gone. I hope there is a corporate memory in AID that can sustain and apply those
                    experiences elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '79 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In '79, I came back to Washington and spent a year at the National War
                    College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WILCOX: It was a traditional break that Foreign Service officers get in their
                    career for senior training. I had not served in the military and found the
                    opportunity to get to know senior military officers very useful. The curriculum
                    at the War College at that time wasn't particularly rigorous. We had lots of
                    spare time. There was an emphasis on broad self-improvement that went beyond the
                    academic. I enjoyed it a lot, and wrote my required paper on productivity in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in the summer of 1980 you were up for assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. I should mention that I traveled with a War College group to Saudi
                    Arabia, Egypt, and Bahrain, my first visit to the Middle East. I also visited
                    Jerusalem on the side after we finished the trip with some of my classmates,
                    where I was to return later as Chief of Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Middle</hi>
                </p>
                <p>East at this particular time?</p>
                <p>WILCOX: It was new to me. I was captivated by Jerusalem, as many foreigners are
                    on their first visit there. Such visits are rather superficial because you fly
                    from one country to another and don't see very much, but valuable, nonetheless.
                    My impression of SaudArabia was that it was rich country, but very traditional
                    and without developed modern institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Egypt? I would have thought if there had been
                        sort of a carryover from Bangladesh. Here was a place with essentially a
                        large population, more sophisticated and all that, but at the same time had
                        too damn many people in too small a place.WILCOX: I have since visited Cairo
                        many times. With its huge, poor population, it resembles New Delhi or
                        Calcutta.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: After I finished with the War College, I went to work in the Bureau of
                    International Organizations Affairs (IO), as one of the deputies in the office
                    of UN Political Affairs. I was in IO from 1980 to 1983.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I was deeply involved in the Middle East issues which preoccupied the
                    United Nations, as well as arms control issues, peace keeping issues. I got the
                    beginning of my education about the Middle East in IO working very closely with
                    the NEA [ Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs] bureau on an annual cycle
                    of UN General Assembly resolutions involving the Arab-Israeli conflict and on a
                    plethora of resolutions in the Security Council on Israeli practices toward the
                    Palestinians, Israeli settlements, the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear
                    reactor, major terrorist attacks against Americans in Lebanon and elsewhere, and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, lets start with sort of the structure within the
                        United Nations. You were dealing with these from the Department of State.
                        What was your particular working relationship with our mission in New
                        York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Our policy toward the United Nations at that time was evolving into a
                    very adversarial one. The Reagan administration, which arrived in 1981, was
                    quite skeptical about the UN and multilateral approaches to foreign policy.
                    There were many in the new administration who saw the UN as a hostile entity in
                    which third world nations and neutralists and pro-Soviet states would gang up
                    against the U.S.The leading supporter of this view was Ambassador Jeanne
                    Kirkpatrick, who was President Reagan's permanent representative in New York.
                    She was an articulate former academic with a desire for influence who packaged
                    and articulated this anti-UN policy very skillfully, very effectively. She
                    appealed to a sector of American public opinion and the Congress. She had little
                    interest in trying to use the United Nations to our advantage and viewed it as a
                    hostile adversary. Many of us in the Department thought that was the wrong
                    policy, and that the U.S. had to work more creatively and constructively with
                    the UN, and we could use it to our advantage. So there was tension between the
                    professional Foreign Service and the policy leadership on our policy in the UN.
                    Part of the Reagan administration's antagonism toward the UN was the way the
                    Middle East conflict played out there. In the absence of other means for
                    influencing U.S. policy and in the absence of an ongoing peace process that
                    could address the conflict through negotiations, the Arab states and the
                    Palestinians used the UN as a forum for attacking Israel. Because of our close
                    affinity for Israel, this sharpened the adversarial nature of our relationship
                    with the UN.</p>

                    AmbassadoAndy Young came a-cropper because of his freelance diplomacy with the
                    PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization], and the domestic political backlash
                    forced him to resign. There were also a series of resolutions in the Security
                    Council at that time, which were very controversial. One of them involved
                    Israeli settlements and East Jerusalem, and because of an uproar over a U.S.
                    decision to support that resolution, the administration actually retracted its
                    vote afterwards. Ultimately, the Carter administration, feeling the domestic
                    political heat, retreated from its mission of trying to use the UN as an
                    instrument in the Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

                        appointments came out including Ambassador Kirkpatrick, within the IO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Ambassador Kirkpatrick was a professor at Georgetown whose expertise was
                    Latin America and Argentina. She caught the Reagan Administration's attention in
                    an article in Commentary that argued that in facing bad choices between leftist
                    or communist regimes on the one hand, and right wing authoritarian regimes on
                    the other, the U.S. should support rightist regimes notwithstanding their
                    anti-democratic, anti-human rights policies. Her argument was that once a
                    country goes communist, it is lost forever. This simplistic and overdrawn
                    theory, which history has since disproved, probably helped draw the U.S. more
                    deeply into associations with right wing authoritarian regimes for which we had
                    very little affinity. I think it helped more to contribute to polarization than
                    to diplomacy and to reducing the tensions of the Cold War. It also drove a wedge
                    between the United States and the nations of the developing and non-aligned
                    world who used the United Nations as a forum to assert their own influence and
                    who were fond of anti-western and anti-colonial rhetoric.</p>
                <p>It was true that the non-aligned did use the UN to pursue a lot of nonsense and
                    harmful initiatives, but these were in fact of little consequence. We paid too
                    much attention to these negative aspects of UN politics, while we should have
                    been using our considerable influence and power more creatively to influence
                    these countries in a positive way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: John Quincy Adams said, “The United States should not go abroad in search

                <p>WILCOX: Dick McCall who had been a congressional aide to Senator Dale McGee of
                    Wyoming, was the assistant secretary until the end of the Carter administration.
                    Then Elliott Abrams, a brilliant young neo-conservative lawyer who later became
                    Reagan's assistant secretary for human rights, was appointed.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Eliot was clever, strong-minded, and very able. I liked him, though I
                    disagreed with his ideology. Unfortunately for Eliot, he clashed with Jean
                    Kirkpatrick, whom he was supposed to be instructing in New York, who was no less
                    strong minded and who did not wish to receive instructions from the Department
                    of State. The two of them were ideologically like-minded, but they were not
                    compatible because both were interested in policy and influence. Jeanne
                    prevailed, and Elliott went to the Human Rights Bureau. He was not in IO long
                    enough, I think, to make a major mark.</p>

                        frustrated, how did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think it is more complicated than that. It wasn't all black and white.
                    As is the case with all political appointees who assume senior positions in the
                    Department of State, their ideological views over time are tempered by the
                    realities of diplomacy and U.S. interests, and they become more pragmatic. They
                    also recognize that they have in their service a lot of able, dedicated, not
                    apolitical but disciplined, Foreign Service officers who are there to carry out
                    the president's policy. Over the years, as new administrations and secretaries
                    of state and their political appointees have come in, they and the professional
                    Foreign Service ultimately learn that they need to work with each other. That
                    happened in the Reagan years, and work of the government carried on.</p>

                        Palestine, the Holy Land, anyway that area prior to the Israeli invasion of
                        Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The UN had been deeply involved since the very beginning, since the birth
                    of Israel, the partition resolution of 1947 which called for the creation of the
                    state of Israel. The Arab states rejected this, and the Israel military saw it
                    as merely a stage toward acquiring more territory. The UN continued to be much
                    involved together with the United States. A whole series of landmark Security
                    Council resolutions that we supported and helped to frame were the backbone of
                    U.S. policy. Resolutions 242 and 338, which embodied the principle of land for
                    peace, based upon negotiations were for years the bedrock of U.S. policy. The
                    authority of those resolutions and the stature of the UN as a player in the
                    conflict began to decline in the 1980s, while U.S. policy was becoming more
                    subject to the pressures of domestic politics.</p>
                <p>Our policy toward the status of Jerusalem is a good example. We had quite
                    forthrightly voted for a Security Council resolution in 1981 that condemned
                    Israel's extension of its law and authority to East Jerusalem. We viewed this as
                    a violation of international law that treated East Jerusalem as occupied
                    territory. We had also addressed the question of Israeli settlements
                    forthrightly by supporting UN resolutions that criticized settlements as a
                    violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. But as the years passed, our policy
                    became less pointed. We increasingly abstained, or voted against UN resolutions
                    critical of Israel, irrespective of their merits, and we began to see the
                    Security Council as well as the General Assembly as troublesome, pro-Arab
                    meddlers. It is true, that the Arab states would rush to the Security Council,
                    to the General Assembly where they knew they could marshal majorities, and in
                    the Security Council, force the U.S. into vetoes. But it was also true that U.S.
                    diplomacy toward creating peace was less aggressive that it should have been,
                    and that there were opportunities for moving the stubborn parties, both Israel
                    and Arab, toward negotiations that were not taken. That situation was to
                    continue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction of IO and the U.S. from your

                        call it into Lebanon which sort of kicked over the beehive? This was in

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: This was in '82. Many historians think Secretary Haig gave the Israelis a
                    so-called yellow light, and many in the U.S., including Henry Kissinger, thought
                    the invasion would effectively put the PLO out of business and pave the way to
                    peace. But our formal position opposed to the invasion, and we became
                    increasingly at odds with the government of Israel as Sharon pushed the IDF all
                    the way to Beirut and inflicted heavy casualties on Lebanese civilians.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Phil Habib and Morrie Draper were engaged in strenuous diplomacy to get the
                    Israelis out. The U.S. supported UN Security Resolution 425, calling for
                    withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. After the exodus of the PLO from
                    Beirut, the massacre of Palestinians at the refugee camp of Sabra and Shatila in
                    West Beirut, and Israel's withdrawal from the Beirut suburbs, which Habib and
                    Draper negotiated, the U.S. then pressed Lebanon to enter into an agreement in
                    November 1983 that would give the Israelis a residual military presence in the
                    south. Amin Gemayel, the President of Lebanon, later repudiated the agreement,
                    under pressure from Syria, which had not been a part of the negotiation and
                    believed it had been imposed on Lebanon. (Our Ambassador in Damascus, Bob
                    Paganelli, had warned Shultz that without Syrian participation and support, the
                    Israel-Lebanon negotiations that eventually led to the November 1983 agreement,
                    could not succeed. He was right.) Thereafter, Israel, unilaterally established a
                    “security zone” in the south where Israeli troops and an Israeli Christian
                    backed mercenary force were deployed. Syria also continued to maintain forces in
                    Lebanon, mainly in the Bekka Valley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, I mean here you had a very
                        politicized administration. Were they taking what would be considered a
                        pro-Israeli stance? How were they coming out on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think the United States from the beginning has been pro-Israel. It is a
                    product of a lot of things, including the Bible and the image of the holy land
                    that American Christians hold, and of the strength of the Judeo-Christian
                    tradition. The emotional quality of Israel in the American mind is very
                    powerful. It has deeply influenced our relationship with Israel and the way we
                    looked at the Arab-Israeli conflict. The strategic dimension has also been a
                    part of our support for Israel and our involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                    During the Cold War, we saw Israel as a strong, friendly, democratic state
                    whereas the Arab states were hostile, or at least not close to the U.S.,
                    especially after the rupture of diplomatic relations between Israel and the
                    United States after the 1967 war and the OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum
                    Exporting Countries] oil embargo in 1973 after the Yom Kippur war. Strategic
                    considerations pulled us in opposite directions in those days: in support of
                    even greater proximity to democratic, pro-U.S. Israel, and in support of
                    restoring good relations with the Arab states which were at odds with Israel
                    lest they fall under the sway of the USSR and further threaten our oil supply.
                    There was constant tension and controversy over these competing strategic
                    criteria, but by and large, our pro-Israel orientation prevailed.</p>
                <p>In the 1930s and early '40s the Department of State and the Near East Bureau were
                    inclined to support the Arab viewpoint and many in the Foreign Service thought
                    that the creation of the state of Israel would lead to war and conflict. Before
                    1948 many Foreign Service officers were skeptical, if not opposed to the
                    creation of Israel, given the opposition of the Arab world and U.S. strategic
                    interests there.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Secretary of State George Marshall, did counseled Truman against support
                    for Israel, and officers in the Middle East Bureau, who had served in Arab
                    countries saw Zionism as a disruptive enterprise that could only cause trouble
                    and harm our strategic interests in the region. At home, however, the American
                    public, had become increasingly pro-Zionist, because of the impact of the
                    Holocaust and the catastrophe for the Jews of the Nazi era. The need for justice
                    for the Jewish people and a homeland in which hundreds of thousands of refugees,
                    who even after WWII had not been welcomed in other countries, including the
                    U.S., had great appeal. President Truman was responding, in part, to this public
                    opinion when he decided that the U.S. would immediately recognize the State of
                    Israel when it was established in 1948. At that time, Americans had little
                    knowledge of the Palestinians or their equities in this conflict. Striking a
                    fair balance between our commitment to justice for the Jewish people and to the
                    new State of Israel and the need for redress to the Palestinian people has been
                    a dilemma for the U.S. that has still not been resolved.</p>

                    working with both sides, I have a strong sense of the equities, the call for
                    justice of both the Israelis and the Palestinians. Both are people who have
                    suffered terrible tragedies. But history cannot be re-made, and there must be a
                    solution that does justice to them both through an equitable compromise.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Sabra and Shatila. This period in Lebanon, in my opinion, was the nadir
                    of U.S. policy in the Middle East. We had very little understanding of the
                    intricate, complex nature of Lebanese politics. At that time, we saw the Middle
                    East through an east-west prism, and to a lesser extent, an Arab-Israeli prism.
                    The Cold War perspective clouded clear thinking, since it had little to do with
                    the factors that were driving the policies of Israel, Lebanon and the
                    Palestinians. In the beginning, we were less hard on Israel's disastrous
                    involvement in Lebanon than we should have been because we saw Israel as a
                    strategic ally and partner in the Cold War. We also made the dreadful mistake of
                    becoming involved as an actor in the Lebanese civil war, in general allying
                    ourselves against the Syrians and pro-Syrian Lebanese, as the Israelis had done,
                    and eventually becoming involved in military activities, although the role of
                    our forces was supposed to have been peace keeping. Our policy was confounded by
                    terrorism by the Hezbollah, supported by both Iran and Syria, which had emerged
                    as a guerilla force determined to drive Israel out of Lebanon. The attack on the
                    Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed hundreds of U.S. Marines, repeated
                    attacks on our embassy in Beirut, with serious loss of life, and the taking of
                    American citizens as hostages by the Hezbollah were disasters, that added a very
                    powerful and volatile emotional element to our adventures in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the people who were making our policy in Lebanon, including
                    National Security Advisor Bud McFarlane and former Secretary of Defense Donald
                    Rumsfeld, both of whom at different times were U.S. special envoys to Lebanon,
                    knew little about the country. They were motivated by an exaggerated belief that
                    we could somehow marshal military power in Lebanon to change the balance there,
                    discourage the Syrians and Iranians, and restore American influence in the
                    Middle East. White House staffers at the time were actually calling for large
                    scale U.S. troop deployments in Lebanon. We allowed ourselves, unwittingly, to
                    be drawn in as a participant in the conflict rather than a peacekeeper. As a
                    result of attacks on the Marines, we began to shell the Hezbollah and Druze
                    positions from offshore, and to use U.S. air power. We came a cropper.
                    Ultimately, after saying that we would stay the course in Lebanon and that it
                    was the test of U.S. influence and resolve, we pulled out our forces, calling it
                    a “strategic redeployment.” Three basic lessons from this debacle were that it
                    is often a mistake to view regional conflicts as a product of great power
                    competition; that in peacekeeping missions you don't ally yourself with one side
                    or the other; and that the U.S. needs to provide better security for its
                    embassies and military forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on down to the specifics of work you were both
                        doing and seeing during this time, Was IO playing any part in this or was
                        this moving over to higher reaches of the NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WILCOX: IO worked closely with the Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs
                    (NEA) because major policy issues were addressed in General Assembly and
                    Security Council resolutions. For example, the question of U.S. peacekeeping
                    forces in Lebanon arose. You recall that U.S. forces were sent to Beirut as part
                    of a multinational force to oversee the peaceful departure of the PLO forces to
                    Tunis and an Israeli cease fire. We subsequently withdrew our forces. But after
                    the massacre at Sabra and Shatila and resumed violence elsewhere, the U.S.
                    decided that a peacekeeping force should return to the Beirut area to help
                    restore calm. There was a question about whether the new force should be a UN
                    force, or another multinational force with U.S. participation. I recall arguing,
                    as a minority on behalf of IO, in a meeting in Under Secretary Eagleburger's
                    office that it would be less risky to create a UN force to do the job, but
                    Secretary Shultz decided that U.S. forces should return. One reason for this
                    decision, I believe, was that Prime Minister Shamir opposed inserting a new UN
                    force or an extension of UNIFIL [United Nations International Force in Lebanon],
                    into Beirut area, believing that a renewed U.S. troop deployment would serve
                    Israel's interests. (Israel was always at odds with UNIFIL, whose purpose, never
                    fulfilled, was to keep the peace in south Lebanon after the first Israeli
                    incursion in 1978, I believe.) So we sent back the Marines, who ultimately met
                    with disaster when their barracks were struck by a massive truck bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall why the choice was made that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Partly it was the suspicion and lack of confidence in the UN, partly
                    because Shamir did not want a UN force there, and partly because there were
                    doubts about the efficacy of a UN peacekeeping force a opposed to a U.S. force
                    which we could control and whose capabilities we knew. There may also have been
                    a question of answering criticism in the Arab world that the departure of the
                    first U.S. peace keeping deployment to Beirut was premature, and that if we had
                    stayed longer, the Sabra and Shatila massacre by Eli Hobeika's Christian
                    militia, which was an ally of the Israelis, might have been avoided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was coming from our mission in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think our mission in New York advocated a U.S. force going back
                    although the decision was made in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was very much tied to both experience and
                        particularly the thrust of the administration at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. That's right. UNIFIL had not been an effective force because it had
                    a weak mandate and lacked political support from any of the adversaries, so it
                    had been unable to keep the peace in southern Lebanon. When the Israelis
                    invaded, they rolled right over the top of UNIFIL.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in IO what was the feeling of how could it be an
                        effective UN Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It would have been necessary to revise its mandate and strengthen its
                    rules of engagement. This would have required a basic consensus, that did not
                    exist, between Lebanon, that was deeply influenced by Syria, and Israel that
                    foreign forces and Lebanese militias should be withdrawn from south Lebanon and
                    that a well armed UN force should have local and international backing to
                    monitor the peace. In fact, there was no such consensus and no peace. The IDF
                    [Israeli Defense Force] was in south Lebanon, Syrian forces were in the north,
                    and Syria was facilitating the arming of Hezbollah and other militias in the
                    south.</p>
                <p>We had to face the question of renewal of UNIFIL's mandate periodically, I think
                    it was every six months. My view at least, and I think one widely shared in IO
                    was that Lebanon, Israel and the U.S. would be best served by having an
                    effective UN force in southern Lebanon. But UNIFIL was toothless. Its troops
                    were not permitted to return hostile fire. It had very weak rules of engagement.
                    It could capture weapons, but then it had to return them. It was a weak because
                    no one wanted it to be strong. It was also not large enough and not widely
                    enough deployed to serve as an effective buffer between Hezbollah and sometimes
                    Palestinian guerrillas who sometimes shot rockets across Israel's northern
                    border. So the idea of an expanded UNIFIL with a stronger mandate never gained
                    much momentum. Congress was not very sympathetic toward UNIFIL in those days,
                    nor was the government of Israel because they thought their interests were
                    better served by having an Israeli force in southern Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we seem to have much of a handle on who were the
                        Hezbollah and also the rapidly turning subject of the whole situation in
                        Lebanon including Hamas and Iranian influence and that whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We had superb Foreign Service officers who spoke Arabic and followed
                    Lebanese politics, although it was very hard for American diplomats to travel in
                    southern Lebanon because of the lack of security there. I think there was a high
                    level of understanding and some good reporting on the factional struggle among
                    the Christians and the Sunni and Shiite Muslims and the Amal, the Hezbollah, and
                    the Syrians. There was a sufficient basis of reporting there to guide the
                    Department. I suspect, however, judging from the policies that emerged, that
                    this reporting was not considered very important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, and Syria was seen as a proxy for the Soviets</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Syria was seen as implacably hostile. The regime was a dictatorship. It
                    had suppressed the rights of Syrians and killed a great many of them, a classic,
                    repressive Arab dictatorship. Syria, indeed, had legitimate interests in
                    Lebanon, but it also expects Syrian hegemony there. Nonetheless, throughout our
                    misadventures in Lebanon, we should have tried to engage the Syrians, because of
                    their influence and their interests, rather than trying to defeat them. In the
                    end, they helped defeat us, for example, by forcing the Lebanese to repudiate
                    the November 1973 treaty, and contributing to the humiliating departure of our
                    forces from Lebanon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the case I have heard of one thing of Bob

                        Syria didn't sign on and blew the thing our of the water. Were you getting
                        reflections of that back in IO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this, was IO, I mean you were a participant with NEA
                        and all, did you have the feeling that it was really NEA and higher up at
                        the top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, it was a collegial process. I spent most of my time in the
                    corridors between IO and NEA. We did much of the drafting, speeches, statements,
                    Policy statements, talking points, draft resolutions in the UN, messages to
                    foreign government leaders. IO was very much part of the process, and weighed in
                    on all policy recommendations. There were times when NEA and IO might have
                    differed and expressed different views to the seventh floor. In those days, when
                    a decision went forward, often there were split views among bureaus. But in
                    general there was a large area of agreement between IO and NEA.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Yes, although Elliott Abrams wasn't there long enough to make his mark on
                    these policies. He was a strong neo-conservative.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: He was replaced by Greg Newell after a long interim. Greg was a young man
                    who had been an advance officer for President, and he was appointed to the
                    assistant secretary's job. He was an engaging, presentable guy, but had no
                    experience in foreign affairs, which he readily acknowledged. He worked very
                    closely with Ambassador Kirkpatrick and did not attempt to carve out policies of
                    his own. He saw her as taking the lead in our UN policy, and they were quite
                    close.</p>

                        events, and you have somebody who really is sort of a public relations type
                        person there but certainly has no respect from the other bureaus, I would
                        think this would be disheartening to the people in IO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There is always that tension in the Department of State where people have
                    come in who have won their appointments on the basis of their political
                    associations and work rather than their foreign policy expertise. Greg Newell
                    was a very courteous, decent, engaging fellow. He treated his Foreign Service
                    colleagues with respect, listened to them, so there wasn't a hostile
                    relationship by any means. Because there is so much going on and decisions had
                    to be made all the time on a myriad of issues, the professionals had a great
                    deal of influence, indeed, they probably called the shots on 90% of the
                    questions that came up. On that 10% of the more politically loaded ones, they
                    didn't. They weighed in and did their job and gave their best.</p>
                <p>That's life in Washington. If you don't understand that you are serving a
                    political leadership which has its own problems and is driven by different
                    forces, then you can't function successfully. If the Foreign Service feels that
                    it is the sole arbitrator of what our policy is going to be and it has a mandate
                    to make that policy, then it will fail. I think the Foreign Service has adapted
                    to this reality rather well. Still, I believe that our foreign policy has become
                    excessively a product of the short term domestic and political considerations.
                    As a result, there is a decreasing premium on the knowledge of professional
                    diplomats who know the world, who have lived in these countries and who have a
                    longer range view of American interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>It is often said that Foreign Service officers tend to reflect the interests of
                    our clients abroad rather than the United States. I think that canard is not
                    true at all. I think Foreign Service officers are deeply skeptical and
                    realistic. They often understand the realities of the world better than others
                    because they have lived out there and have worked with foreigners. Their voice
                    has been declining in the last generation. U.S. foreign policy must ultimately
                    be a product of American democracy and what the public, the Congress and the
                    President want. But in recent years, it has become excessively subject to
                    ephemeral domestic impulses at the expense of long term American interests.</p>

                        ever happens. How about during the 1980 election, were these promises made?
                        Was anything done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In those days we stuck to a forthright, well defined policy on Jerusalem,
                    i.e., that Jerusalem was occupied territory, that it was subject to resolution
                    242 and 338, the basic land for peace deal that the UN had set forth, and that
                    unilateral moves by the Israelis in East Jerusalem were a violation of
                    international law. After 1980 we began to muffle and fudge our declaratory
                    policy under pressures from the Congress and the Jewish community. The last time
                    the U.S. defined Jerusalem as occupied territory was when George Bush mentioned
                    it at a press conference. He was taken to task for that, and I think his
                    successors have read a lesson from that, that Jerusalem is a politically
                    radioactive issue. All we can say now is that Jerusalem is subject to
                    negotiation. The problem of Jerusalem will have to be resolved before there can
                    be a stable and permanent deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the
                    Arabs. That is a problem that is not impossible, but is increasingly difficult
                    because of the movement of large numbers of Israelis into East Jerusalem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, again I am going back to this '80-'83 thing,
                        was there tension with the Shamir government on the part of NEA, IO...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. The Likud government that came to power in 1977 was seen as very
                    different and less friendly than the Labor governments that had held power since
                    1948. Likud was more militant and ideological, being wedded to the belief that
                    the West Bank and Gaza are part of greater Israel and a biblical patrimony to be
                    reclaimed. When Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank in 1967, the
                    Likud and the Israeli right, in general, saw this as a fulfillment of a biblical
                    prophesy. The religious-nationalist element in Israeli politics grew stronger
                    and more confident, and the victory of the Likud in 1977 reflected this. The
                    settlement movement, led by religious-nationalist Israelis, was in the vanguard
                    of this change and was aggressively promoted by Likud politicians.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Settlements in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza expanded steadily. The U.S.
                    protested settlements and adopted the policy that settlements were illegal under
                    the fourth Geneva Convention that defined the rules of military occupation and
                    held that an occupying power cannot move its population into areas it occupies.
                    We supported UN resolutions which made that point repeatedly, and in our
                    declaratory policy, until one day in 1981 or '82 in a press conference,
                    President Reagan, responding to a question, said he did not believe settlements
                    were illegal.</p>
                <p>We were shocked by this apparent change in policy, and I urged NEA to contact the
                    White House to urge it to find a way to get the President to reverse his
                    statement. We thought it might have been inadvertent. But in retrospect it was
                    not. Eugene Rostow, who at that time had become the head of the Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency and had previously been Under Secretary of State for
                    Political Affairs and the Dean of thYale Law School, had written an article
                    claiming that Resolution 242 was wrong, that the West Bank and Gaza were not
                    occupied territory, since there had been no previous agreed sovereign, and that
                    the Fourth Geneva Convention therefore did not apply. This contradicted the
                    official U.S. legal doctrine set forth in a legal opinion by the Legal Advisor
                    at State under Jimmy Carter, Herb Hansell. I think the President had accepted
                    the Rostow thesis when he effectively changed our policy, although the change
                    was never acknowledged or articulated.</p>
                <p>Thereafter, in official statements, settlements were no longer “illegal.” They
                    became “an obstacle to peace.” We used that phraseology for many years, but
                    under President Clinton we began to say merely that “settlements are unhelpful.”
                    I regret that by retreating from our legal doctrine on settlements and
                    attenuating our public statements, we lost an opportunity to stop or slow down
                    the settlements phenomenon that has since become a formidable obstacle to U.S.
                    efforts to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Indeed, the purpose of
                    settlements was to create “facts on the ground” that would make divestiture of
                    the West Bank to the Palestinians impossible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I left in '83 and went to NEA as Director for Regional Affairs to run an
                    office involved in region wide issues. One of the major policy issues we faced
                    there was the threat to regional stability from the Iran-Iraq war which was
                    raging by then. There was a heated debate about whether we should tilt toward
                    Iraq and provide Iraq with weapons and intelligence. There was great concern
                    that Iran would win this war, extend hegemony over Iraq and expand the Islamic
                    revolutionary impulse throughout the Gulf region. Saddam Hussein was known to be
                    a brutal dictator, but many thought he was the lesser of two evils.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>There were intelligence estimates about the threat from Iran that, in retrospect,
                    exaggerated Iran's ability to prevail in that war. The upshot of the policy
                    debate was that we did indeed tilt toward Iraq. We provided Iraq with
                    intelligence, took Baghdad off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, and
                    viewed positively comments from Saddam Hussein suggesting that he supported an
                    Arab-Israeli peace process. Many began to view Iraq optimistically as a
                    potential factor for stability, and Saddam Hussein as man with whom we could
                    work, notwithstanding his authoritarian background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In NEA you had been dealing with but you were still
                        basically the new boy on the block and certainly with the Iran Iraq
                        business. Did you feel there was sort of a visceral carryover no matter what
                        happened? Iran was still the enemy because of the takeover and all that, and
                        that we were sort of projecting that if Iran were our enemy, somehow or
                        other we had to make Iraq into something more than it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, I think that was one impulse behind our policy. It was as you say,
                    an emotional legacy of the hostage taking in Tehran. Iran was seen as an
                    expansionist, hegemonic, dangerous country which threatened the whole region.
                    The intelligence community focused very heavily on the military balance, and in
                    a series of estimates and papers saw Iran as prevailing. In addition to some
                    quiet intelligence support for Iraq, we launched a major U.S. initiative called
                    “Operation Staunch” that was designed to block the sale of arms to Iran. We
                    deployed a U.S. Navy flotilla in the Persian Gulf to stop ships carrying weapons
                    to Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the initiative for all of this coming from? Was
                        this coming from outside the Department or was it coming from the White
                        House, NSC, or was it sort of everywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was not a monolithic view in the Department or even in NEA bureau.
                    The White House leaned toward a more positive favorable approach toward Iraq, as
                    did some in NEA, even after Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against Kurds
                    in the north. Admittedly, this was a difficult shot to call. We were not
                    omniscient about the military balance, and there were signs that Saddam Hussein
                    might evolve into a more pragmatic kind of a ruler with whom we could deal. He
                    had begun, for example, to make moderate statements about the Arab-Israeli peace
                    process which we found remarkable and seized upon as evidence that maybe this is
                    a man who is changing. The idea was Iraq is a big important country with a lot
                    of oil, so let's take a chance. I argued that we should not lean too far toward
                    Iraq, given Saddam Hussein's past and the need to rebuild, some day, a
                    relationship with Iran, but this view did not prevail. My immediate boss on this
                    policy issue, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jim Placke, was also less
                    enthusiastic than others about tilting heavily toward Iraq. The Bureau of
                    Political Military Affairs [PM] and the Pentagon were more pro-Iraq.</p>

                        Union dominated most of our talk in the United Nations and all, and here
                        Iraq was probably the biggest sort of customer or friend of the Soviet
                        Union. How did we feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We thought there might be some chance of drawing Iraq away from the
                    Soviet orbit. It was certainly not locked in to the Soviet orbit although they
                    had friendly relations. There was also a fear in those days, that the Soviets
                    might march into that part of Southwest Asia, might even invade Iran. There was
                    no synthesis between that concern and our decision ultimately to tilt toward
                    Iraq in the war.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting anything important from Saudi Arabia, the

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They saw Iran as the major threat. There is a traditional antipathy
                    between the Sunni Muslims in those countries and the Shia, and a traditional
                    rivalry between the Arabs and the Persians. The Gulf states feared the Iranian
                    animus of Islamic revolution, and so they supported a more friendly U.S. policy
                    toward Iraq.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There wasn't any anticipation in those days that Iraq might invade
                    Kuwait, no concept of that at all at that time. Kuwait was a major partner in
                    “Operation Staunch.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On regional affairs, was this the main thing? Basically
                        regional affairs...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It was one issue. Another was an NSDD [National Security Decision
                    Directive] on strategic cooperation between the United States and Israel. The
                    idea was to formalize and add new structure to longstanding U.S.-Israeli
                    military cooperation which took the form of $1.8 billion annually in grant
                    military assistance to Israel and extensive exercises and cooperation between
                    our two forces. The rationale behind this initiative was to reinforce Israel and
                    the U.S.-Israel military relationship as a bastion against the threat of Soviet
                    influence in the Middle East and Iran. There was much enthusiasm for this in the
                    senior reaches of the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>Further institutionalization of U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation was also
                    popular in some quarters of the Pentagon. The U.S. had been thwarted in its long
                    time effort to obtain basing rights in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf
                    countries. All we had was a kind of tenuous access to Bahrain, and the U.S.
                    command for the Middle East, CENTCOM [Central Command], was based in and still
                    is based in McDill Air Force Base in Florida. Israel could provide a new
                    platform for access and military support in the event of a war with the Soviets
                    in the region.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had COMIDEASTFOR which was a very small, little...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The U.S. military command in the Middle East, COMIDEASTFOR [Commander
                    Mideast Forces] had always had superb relations with the government of Bahrain
                    which has given us facilities there, but we didn't have the kind of basing
                    rights and prepositioning facilities that we wanted to make our access to that
                    part of the world easier. Israel offered to preposition supplies and hospital
                    services, for example, and access to air basis in the event of a conflict. While
                    Israel has always rejected the idea of a defense treaty with the U.S., they say
                    “we will defend ourselves,” they wanted a more fully elaborated strategic
                    cooperation alliance. They wanted this, not because they saw the Soviets as a
                    primary threat, but because they saw this as a way to cement U.S.-Israeli
                    relations against the Arabs, and as another conduit for military aid and
                    technology. So the U.S. and Israel had divergent views on the basis for
                    strategic cooperation. We saw this as part of a global struggle with the USSR.
                    They saw it as strengthening their position vis a vis the Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that something of this nature, you
                        know, in order to strengthen our position, we just make more enemies.
                        Certainly we would by making this public and doing it would have caused our
                        position with Saudi Arabia which is really very important, far more
                        important than Israel. This is really a pond, I don't know about Egypt, but
                        I would have thought that the experts would say this thing shouldn't fly
                        because we are just adding trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: That was my view. I thought it was useful for the rest of the world and
                    for the Arab states to know that the U.S. and Israel did have a kind of security
                    relationship, that we were concerned about Israel's security and supported it.
                    At the same time, I thought that the Arabs would see an institutionalized
                    strategic cooperation relationship not as an anti-Soviet initiative but
                    something aimed squarely at them, and that this would weaken our role as honest
                    broker in the peace process. They did.</p>
                <p>Also, the urge for strategic cooperation with Israel came at the same time that
                    the Congress was resisting, increasingly, sales of U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia and
                    other Arab states. The Congress was strongly influenced by AIPAC [American
                    Israeli Public Affairs Committee], which argued that there were no “moderate”
                    Arab regimes, and that all U.S. arms sales to Arab states threatened Israel's
                    security.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, after a long debate and many papers, the Administration issued an
                    NSDD on U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation and created detailed new structures
                    for this. This produced a series of meetings at committees at both the political
                    diplomatic level and the military to military level to enhance cooperation. It
                    also created expanded joint exercises and other forms of cooperation than in the
                    past. These were attractive to our armed forces, who enjoyed engaging with
                    Israel's superb military forces, so they learned from us and we learned from
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Politically and strategically, the results of strategic cooperation are unclear.
                    In hindsight, the Soviet threat to Middle East was exaggerated. Enhanced
                    military cooperation with Israel and Israel's clear military superiority in the
                    Middle East was doubtless a factor that led Syria and Jordan and the
                    Palestinians to move toward peace with Israel. It may also, have given Israel,
                    as the U.S. hoped, greater confidence in its security and a willingness
                    therefore to be more forthcoming in making peace with the Arabs. At the same
                    time, it can be argued that Israel's overwhelming superiority and assurances of
                    U.S. support gave its leaders a sense of complacency and over-reliance on
                    military force over the years, as opposed to diplomacy, for its security, and
                    that this delayed the onset of the peace process.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Egypt made peace with Israel in 1978. Part of the deal was that Egypt
                    would receive a very large aid dividend in the realm of I think about $1.7
                    billion a year in economic and military assistance. Israel got about $3 billion.
                    The Egyptians were far ahead of the rest of the Arab world in recognizing that
                    Israel was an important and powerful state and that ultimately the Arab states
                    had to make peace with Israel. They were not thrilled about our new strategic
                    cooperating relationship with Israel, but we also had close military ties with
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern, and this was the '82 aftermath of
                        the Israeli attack on Lebanon, of both the leadership, I'm thinking of
                        Sharon. This was almost a stealth attack, I mean it was an escalating attack
                        using Israeli forces not aligned it looked like even to their own
                        administration while doing it. One that, and two, the Israeli forces were
                        not as well disciplined as they had been before - I mean with some of the
                        thing that were going on. I mean the Shatila massacres. There was a certain
                        amount of either collusion or suspected collusion with some of the military.
                        I'm told that the Israeli forces were not very careful about where they
                        shelled, about what they did. I mean it was treating of the Lebanese as in a
                        rather brutal way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I believe the IDF [Israeli Defense Force] paid too little heed to
                    civilian casualties during Lebanon adventure. A great many civilian lives were
                    lost through IDF artillery shelling of camps and villages and the aerial
                    bombardment of Beirut. The Israelis argue that they were fighting a guerilla
                    enemy, the Hezbollah and the radical PLO elements, who used refugee camps and
                    villages as havens for their forces, and that civilian casualties were therefore
                    unpreventable. The Lebanon adventure for Israel was in retrospect, a
                    catastrophe. The toll in Lebanese and human rights violations has been well
                    documented, and many Israeli soldiers were also killed. Sharon was indeed the
                    author of the invasion and he carried it to the city of Beirut without
                    authorization from the prime minister or the cabinet. The whole Lebanon
                    adventure was a loser for Israel, indeed, a strategic, political and
                    humanitarian disaster.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any concerns that the IDF was a rogue army,
                        among the leadership. Not too long after the Israeli invasion,, we are
                        talking about a strategic relationship with the same government which lied
                        like hell to us during the invasion. I have people talking about the famous
                        incident where the Begin government is telling us, “Oh, we are not shelling
                        Beirut,” and Phil Habib, who is in Beirut, holds out the telephone and says,
                        “What the hell do you think that is?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The invasion created considerable strains in our relationship, and the
                    Sabra Shatila massacre was indeed a low point. The IDF could have stopped it. To
                    its credit, the government convened a board of inquiry and wrote a very damning
                    report which resulted in the Ariel Sharon departure from the government for a
                    period, but he has since been rehabilitated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing the radicalization of Lebanon because of
                        all this. Was this of concern to us other than in a hostage...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Lebanese civil war was in part the result of an increasing resentment
                    by the majority of Lebanese against control by a small Maronite Christian
                    minority. The deal that had been struck for political power sharing among the
                    different factions broke down because it no longer reflected the demographic
                    realities. That was the main indigenous reason for the conflict. The war was
                    vastly complicated by Syrian interference, the PLO's creation of an armed state
                    within a state in Lebanon after they were expelled from Jordan in the Black
                    September conflict, and finally the Israeli invasion. Lebanon was an unholy
                    mess. The origins of the conflict were indigenous, but Lebanon's neighbors made
                    it a lot worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there voices saying maybe we ought to get the hell
                        out of this whole thing. I mean what are the voices saying for example, this
                        is not an East West problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, but once we made a major diplomatic or military commitment in
                    Lebanon, it was hard to reverse, since the merits of our policy became less
                    important preserving our credibility. That was the major reason why we sent the
                    Marines back and didn't pull them out much earlier. I think it was recognized
                    the Marines were vulnerable, that they were no longer a legitimate peace keeping
                    force, but we felt the United States would be dishonored to turn tail.
                    Ultimately, we did after the Marines barracks were bombed. I wish we could have
                    done it more gracefully and earlier. Indeed, I wish we had not sent the Marines
                    back. Q: Did the hostage situation in Lebanon, American civilians being taken
                    hostage and all, did that become at this point, I am talking about the '83-'84
                    period, was that a dominant force, was that something that sort of came up every
                    day?</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WILCOX: It was a very powerful issue. The families of the hostage victims were
                    well organized and vocal. The administration earlier had adopted a policy of no
                    concessions toward terrorism, but we were under enormous pressure to do
                    something to release our countrymen. This led ultimately to the fiasco of the
                    Iran Contra scandal during the Bush administration.</p>
                <p>I was still in NEA at the time, but I was in a different job. Lebanon was seen as
                    a curse. An American ambassador, Frank Meloy, was assassinated in Beirut, Frank
                    Meloy. Many American diplomats lost their lives. Hundreds of Marines on the
                    peace keeping mission were killed in a murderous terrorist attack, our hostages
                    were languishing in Hezbollah jails. So, there was fear and loathing about
                    Lebanon which tended to cloud dispassionate thinking. And the people in the
                    White House who were really making our policy in Lebanon were doing so without
                    the benefit of knowledge and experience about Lebanon or the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is something I'd like to get the feeling about
                        because as we do these things, you know, it sounds as if there is a mega
                        government making decisions, and so often, I have found in my interviews
                        that you find the more intense something gets in foreign affairs, the more
                        quickly it moves away from people who know anything about the damn
                        subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was National Security Advisor and ex-Marine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Bud McFarlane. Ollie North, Phil Durr, Howard Teicher, and John
                    Poindexter where also involved. Another NSC staffer, who was experienced and
                    respected, had died, and NSC policy toward Lebanon and the Middle East was
                    heavily influenced by people who had little background in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was NEA aware that it wasn't really in control of the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this display itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, the experts in NEA who didn't understand the situation were
                    offering their views and advice, but the policy was really being carried out at
                    a different and higher level. Secretary of State Shultz was sometimes kept out
                    of the picture, for example, in the Iran-Contra episode, although he had been
                    heavily involved in the negotiations of the abortive November 17 agreement. But,
                    as always, the people at the Department tried to do their job and express their
                    views while supporting the President's policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm wondering too, as new boy on the block you often see
                        things almost a little clearer, the divisions. I would have thought that
                        there might have been a problem with people in NEA who knew about Lebanon,
                        one we are talking about a Lebanon no longer existing, and that they had
                        been sort of caught up in the Christian side of Lebanon, and there wasn't as
                        much contact with the Arabs, particularly the lower class side. I don't
                        know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Some of the most articulate, westernized, sophisticated and charming
                    Lebanese are the Maronite Christians who have a strong affinity for Americans
                    and other westerners. But the pure Maronite political philosophy was narrow,
                    sectarian and ultra nationalistic. Perhaps some American diplomats and
                    policymakers were beguiled by the Lebanese, especially the Maronites, but I
                    think our Foreign Service officers who served in Beirut on the whole have taken
                    the measure of all the parties and reported back to Washington objectively.
                    Three things, at least, contributed to U.S. mistakes in Lebanon: domestic
                    politics and our strong pro-Israel orientation; misplaced concerns that this was
                    another theater of the Cold War conflict, that were related, in part, to our
                    alliance with Israel; and inexperienced people in the White House calling the
                    shots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point, and we'll pick it up the
                        next time in '84 when you moved over in NEA to Arab-Israeli affair which
                        sounds like a very quiet spot.</hi>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is May 28, 1998. Phil, you were in Arab-Israeli affairs from '84 to
                    when?</p>
                <p>WILCOX: '84-'87, whereupon I moved up to become the Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    with responsibility for Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, and the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well, let' take the '84-'87 period. In the
                        first place, what did Arab-Israeli affairs mean at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The name of the office was the Office of Israeli and Arab-Israeli
                    Affairs. It manages our bilateral relations with Israel, but also to covers the
                    Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We saw our job as working to protect U.S.
                    interests in our relations with Israel, but also to relate to the Palestinians
                    and their conflict with the Israelis, which of course, is very central to the
                    whole Middle East conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were of, I mean the influence of the
                        AIPAC is renowned, and it influence in Congress in unexcelled. Did you have
                        a feeling when you went into that job that you were being vetted by them or
                        worked on by them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It is called the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee. Yes, indeed.
                    As the pre-eminent American interest group, lobby, which devotes itself to U.S.-
                    Israel relations, they take a keen interest in the activities of the Department
                    of State and the executive branch as well as the Congress. They, of course,
                    cultivate and follow the views and actions of all senior diplomats at State
                    involved in the Middle East. They speak to them regularly, and present their
                    point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything passing for that from the Palestinian
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Palestinian community in the U.S. and the larger Arab-American
                    community are divided by national origin and religion, and are far less
                    organized than the American Jewish community. In the 1980s the Arab-American
                    community became better organized and developed regular contacts with State,
                    seeking to influence U.S. policy. We thought it was necessary to maintain strong
                    ties with both the American Jewish community in all its complexity - not just
                    AIPAC but a host of American Jewish organizations representing a wide range of
                    views - and the Arab-American community which also included many organizations.
                    The preeminent Arab-American group then was the National Association of
                    Arab-Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in 1984 when you took over this, let's talk about
                        the bilateral and then we will move to the Palestinian thing. How was Israel
                        viewed at that time, and what were our concerns with Israel per se?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The United States and the American people had a profound relationship
                    with Israel from the very beginning. It is an unusually complex relationship. I
                    think Americans in general have an extraordinary interest in Israel. We have a
                    sense of emotional and cultural affinity for Israel because of the Bible, the
                    Christian majority in American society, and our definition of our culture and
                    tradition as Judeo-Christian. The creation of the State of Israel in
                    fundamentalist Christian theology, was seen as fulfillment of a Biblical
                    prophesy, so it evoked tremendous enthusiasm among conservative Christians in
                    the U.S. As that conservative Christian community has grown stronger, its
                    religious attachment to Israel has expressed itself in the politics of the
                    U.S.-Israel relationship.</p>
                <p>The fact that the U.S. government did not come to the rescue of the Jews during
                    the holocaust for whatever reasons weighed heavily on the conscience of the
                    United States I think was another reason why there has been strong political
                    support in the United States for the establishment of Israel as a homeland and a
                    refuge for the remnant of the Jewish community and U.S. support for Israel's
                    security. President Truman recognized that and against the recommendation of
                    many of his foreign policy advisors, recognized the new state of Israel
                    immediately when it was declared in 1948.</p>
                <p>Israel's character as a democratic country also appeals to Americans and is a
                    strong element in the U.S.-Israel relationship.</p>
                <p>The American Jewish community which is the largest Jewish community in the world,
                    was wary about Zionism in the 1920s and '30s, but because of the holocaust,
                    WWII, and the struggle for the State of Israel which succeeded in '48, the
                    community became passionately interested in Israel and organized itself to
                    promote U.S. government support.</p>
                <p>So U.S. support for Israel has been rooted in broad public support for Israel,
                    based on religions and history, and by a determined, highly skilled, very well
                    organized U.S. Jewish community.</p>
                <p>Another dimension to the U.S.-Israeli relationship that emerged during the Cold
                    War has been strategic. The strategic rationale for a strong U.S.-Israeli
                    relationship during the Cold War was that Israel, as a democratic westernized
                    state with strong armed forces was an anchor for the west in the Middle East, a
                    region in which many Arab states were unfriendly if not hostile to the U.S. and
                    sometimes more sympathetic to the Soviet Union. This rationale has waxed and
                    waned. It was not very strong during the Eisenhower Kennedy administration,
                    which supported Israel, but tempered this support because of interests in the
                    Arab world. The strategic rational grew stronger during the Nixon and years and
                    reached its height during Reagan era. As one reason for strong support for
                    Israel, it has been energetically promoted by American Jewish organizations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know there is the other side of that which is that if
                        we hadn't been so firmly involved in Israel, the Soviets wouldn't have
                        gotten a foothold in the Arab world because Islam is not very receptive to
                        communism basically and sort of cast it off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I doubt that there was ever a major threat that the Muslim Arab states
                    would be permanent allies of the Soviet Union, although the U.S. was right at
                    that time to be concerned about Soviet efforts to gain influence in the region.
                    Control of the oil fields was also a factor. However, the Arabs didn't like
                    communism. Although they went through a phase of Arab socialism which was a
                    failure, their economic tradition historically has been capitalist and free
                    market.</p>
                <p>There was never an elegant synthesis by any U.S. administration that sought to
                    resolve the tension between our strong support, which became a quasi alliance,
                    for Israel and our need to remain even handed in the Arab-Israeli dispute, or
                    the argument that if we lean too far toward Israel, the Soviets would gain
                    influence in the Arab world to the detriment of U.S. strategic interests. One
                    argument often heard, which had some merit, was that the Arabs, because of their
                    culture and religion, were not going to “go communist,” whatever the nature of
                    our relations with Israel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming in to the job, did you find yourself being either
                        obliquely or directly told or at least your mental mindset was boy this
                        thing domestically it has a real, the domestic side is so important in this
                        whole thing and that in your actions that whatever happened you were sort of
                        looking over your shoulder at the domestic side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Absolutely. There are few foreign policy issues that are influenced by
                    domestic politics to the same extent; although, domestic politics has a
                    pervasive and growing impact on foreign policy in general, more than in the
                    past. Yes indeed, the Congress was deeply involved, and a variety of American
                    pro-Israeli organizations that were well organized, funded, and politically
                    sophisticated. It was a job where one had to do ones job had to be mindful of
                    American politics and domestic currents, as well as larger American strategic
                    interests. Reconciling these in the Arab-Israeli conflict has never been
                    easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about the strategic importance of
                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I think that the strategic importance of Israel as a military ally was
                    always exaggerated. No Israeli government has ever contemplated asking the U.S.
                    to station troops in Israel or to come to Israel's defense militarily. From the
                    very beginning, when Israel was more or less alone and had to develop its own
                    army, it became very self reliant with respect to fighting forces, and developed
                    the most powerful, capable armed force in the Middle East. Notwithstanding our
                    close relations, I think all Israeli governments have avoided forfeiting their
                    independence for a U.S.-Israel defense treaty.</p>
                <p>As I have said, there was a strategic rationale which was strongest in the '80s,
                    that Israel provided a platform for positioning weapons, materials, temporary
                    basing facilities, even medical facilities that the U.S. could use in the event
                    of an emergency in the Persian Gulf, including a possible Soviet invasion. That
                    was argued passionately. At that time, the Arab states in the Gulf would not
                    allow the U.S. to establish the kind of basing and prepositioning facilities
                    that the U.S. military needed to bring force to bear quickly in a military
                    emergency in the Gulf region. Proponents of strategic cooperation argued that
                    Israel was the only alternative. Eventually that view prevailed in the form of a
                    more formal Israeli-U.S. strategic relationship.</p>
                <p>The argument against formalizing this relationship was that for the U.S. to use
                    Israel as a partner in a war against a hostile Arab state would alienate
                    friendly Arab states and cripple our ability to use military power in the
                    region. (The Bush Administration acknowledged this, in fact, when it pressed
                    Israel to stay out of the Gulf War, even though Israel was under fire from Iraqi
                    Scud missiles.) Also, even in the event of a Soviet attack on the region,
                    Israeli involvement would complicate U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the Pollard case developed? Would you explain what the
                        Pollard case was because this is the Pollard case and the sinking of the
                        Liberty which we have discussed before have always been a little poison in
                        the relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Pollard was an analyst at the Defense Naval Intelligence Agency who stole
                    sensitive documents and passed them to Israel. He was a troubled, vulnerable
                    young man who was very enthusiastic about Israel. Recognizing his vulnerability,
                    the Israelis recruited him. It was an inept operation, and Pollard was
                    discovered and arrested. This created considerable strain with Israel because or
                    our expectation we were friends and allies. We saw the affair as a breach of
                    trust and told the government of Israel. Secretary George Shultz, who had done
                    much to help Israel and strengthen relations, was livid, especially since the
                    government of Israel lied about their involvement with Pollard, notwithstanding
                    the clarity of the evidence. Pollard pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to life
                    in prison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I think the Pollard thing erupted in 1985 or '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is on your watch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. I worked very closely with the U.S. attorney, Joe DeGeneva, at the
                    time, with Abe Sofaer, the Legal Advisor at State, and the FBI. Pollard
                    compounded his problem after his conviction by holding long interviews with Wolf
                    Blitzer, who at that time worked for the Jerusalem Post. In these prison
                    interviews, Pollard revealed more classified information. I think that may have
                    influenced the judge's decision to give Pollard life, whereas other convicted
                    spies had sometimes received lesser sentences. The government of Israel has
                    since implicitly acknowledged its responsibility for Pollard, by seeking his
                    release.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there debates within the department within NEA about
                        how do we approach this or what do we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was a firm and uniform view that Pollard should be dealt with by
                    our judicial system and if found guilty, dealt with severely as all spies and
                    traitors should be. There was no effort in NEA to trim or compensate because of
                    the impact of Pollard's crime on U.S.-Israeli relations. It caused real strain
                    in the relationship. There were also cases of suspected misuse or diversion of
                    military technology by the government of Israel in violation of our agreements
                    that also caused recurrent friction in our relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again we are speaking about the time you were there. As I
                        recall there were things about concern that actually some of our technology
                        was ending up in essentially unfriendly hands or possibly unfriendly hands
                        when it was supposed to be allowed to Israel. Did it happen when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was never clear evidence that Israel had stolen our technology and
                    passed it on to other governments, but the government of Israel maintains a very
                    large high tech arms industry. They are very good at studying foreign technology
                    and adapting it for their own uses. Because of the investment we make in our own
                    technology, we prohibit transfer of U.S. technology to third countries to whom
                    we export arms. The Israelis have cut some corners in this respect over the
                    years. To my knowledge, Pollard's espionage was directed primarily at obtaining
                    sensitive intelligence concerning Arab military capabilities. We were also
                    concerned that these documents compromised intelligence sources and methods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously in something like this, one always tends to look
                        at the tensions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, in that respect, the fact is that because of the weight and depth
                    of the U.S.-Israeli bilateral relationship, it was not shattered by the Pollard
                    affair. It was an unpleasant incident. It did not result in sanctions or
                    withdrawal of U.S. assistance or other punishment, and after a few difficult
                    months it blew over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an effort on our part through talking to the
                        Israeli embassy and also from our embassy in Tel Aviv to get information.
                        Was there any forthcomingness on the part of the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The Israelis initially denied the accusation that Pollard was their
                    agent. They ultimately acknowledged that he had handed over large numbers of
                    documents to them, and there was a certain amount of cooperation with respect to
                    the nature of that material and its return we requested. An FBI mission went to
                    Israel for further consultation with their lawyers and intelligence officials.
                    But that process was grudging and incomplete. The Israelis were careful both to
                    avoid acknowledgment that Pollard was their agent, and they wanted to avoid
                    providing evidence that would have further harmed Pollard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the time, was there any concern, disquiet or
                        something of that nature about the Israeli intelligence operations? It has
                        been built up as being such a wonderful apparatus, but over the years, wrong
                        people have been killed, you know it is like any other intelligence service
                        including our own. It is not that great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It has been mythologized by the Israelis and others. As intelligence
                    services go, they are skilled at gathering information. Their covert action
                    apparatus in my judgment has been less successful. They have, as you know,
                    believed it necessary to carry out retaliatory, covert assassinations against
                    terrorists who have committed terrorism against Israelis. This is a very popular
                    policy, and Israelis believe that there should be no holds barred against such
                    retaliation, and that if Israel does not demonstrate that it is tough, its
                    enemies will redouble their attacks and eventually defeat Israel. Retaliation
                    is, no doubt, an emotionally satisfying policy in response to the outrage of
                    terrorism. BuI believe their policy of retaliation has not deterred terrorism,
                    but has created a cycle of violence and counter retaliation that has cost a
                    great many innocent Israeli as well as Arab lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well moving to sort of the normal relations, it is very
                        easy to get off on one of these things. Here we had this very close
                        relationship. What was your impression of sort of our knowledge of what was
                        going on in Israel during this '84-'87 period? In the first place could you
                        describe what the government was like and our embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Israel is a fascinating country. In the short space of 50 years it has
                    done extraordinary things in developing a strong nation which has excelled in
                    many ways. Another reason for the strong U.S.-Israeli relationship is that
                    Israelis are friendly forthcoming people. They love to talk, and are very frank
                    and outspoken. They devote a lot of attention to the U.S. relationship.</p>
                <p>The U.S.-Israeli relationship has many dimensions beyond the security and the
                    purely political. There is a thick web of social, religious, cultural,
                    scientific, academic and commercial relations. There is no major area of
                    activity where we don't have some kind of liaison in activities with Israel,
                    public or private. There are also hundreds of thousands of Israelis who live in
                    the United States and a fair number of Israeli citizens are former Americans who
                    made Aliyah and became Israeli citizens.</p>
                <p>One of the main elements of our relationship when I was the Director of Israeli
                    and Arab-Israeli affairs was an effort to move the Israeli economy from a more
                    or less centrally directed economy to a more free market capitalist system.
                    Secretary Shultz as an economist was deeply interested in this. Israel had been
                    through a series of economic reversals and was clearly in trouble. Shultz
                    appointed Stanley Fisher who is now the deputy director of the IMF and Herb
                    Stein, a distinguished American economist and former head of the Council of
                    Economic Advisors, to advise him and the Government of Israel on an economic
                    program which would turn them around and generate economic growth, employment
                    and reduce the role of the state in their economy. That was accompanied by
                    creation of a joint economic [commissions], headed on the U.S. side by the
                    Undersecretary for Economic Affairs, Allen Wallis. This effort was quite
                    successful. Israel changed its policies and since then has experienced, more or
                    less, growth and economic stability. A lot of credit goes to George Shultz, Herb
                    Stein and Stan Fisher.</p>
                <p>We hoped at that time that with more rapid economic development and income
                    creation, Israel could be weaned off the very large aid the United States has
                    traditionally provided to Israel. That has not happened. Today, this aid today
                    is less a function of Israel's need, because per capita income in Israel is now
                    higher than it is in the United Kingdom, than of the political bilateral
                    relationship, and the strong commitment of Congress to maintain high levels of
                    aid to Israel. Aid levels were bumped up after the Camp David process and the
                    peace treaty to a level of $1.8 billion in military assistance for Israel and
                    $1.2 billion in economic support funds. and emergency support funds of roughly
                    $3 billion a year. In the beginning those were loans, but the Congress converted
                    them to grant assistance, and in the case of Egypt did the same thing. The
                    appropriation for Egypt was also quite large, of $1.7 billion overall, and that
                    continues today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a matter of almost frustration? One of my
                        interviews, I think it was Sam Harr, economic counselor there at some point,
                        was saying his office in the embassy in Tel Aviv would carefully analyze the
                        Israeli requests and all and would do what any economic guy would do, say
                        well this doesn't make sense, this is too much; cut it down. Essentially the
                        Israeli officials would say thank you very much, laugh in his face, and go
                        get everything they want from Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The aid is a symbol of U.S. support for Israel. It no longer has an
                    economic rationale. The administration since the mid-'80s has not been able to
                    influence the process in the Congress. AIPAC has seen its ability to persuade
                    the Congress to provide this aid as a demonstration of its power and influence
                    as a lobbying organization. It has also been argued that were it not for this
                    very large assistance to Israel, that foreign assistance for other purposes
                    would have declined even more sharply and that the Israeli appropriation carried
                    the foreign aid bill for years and ensured the votes of legislators who would
                    otherwise have voted against all aid. There is some logic to this. On the other
                    hand, there is deep concern in State and AID that the lion's share of the
                    limited resources Congress appropriates for development assistance, over 70%, I
                    believe, goes to only two countries, Israel and Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in '84, which part of it was it the
                        labor government that was in power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was an election as I recall, shortly after I arrived. The returns
                    were indecisive, and since neither Labor nor Likud could form a government, they
                    created a “national unity” government in which Labor and Likud decided to govern
                    for two and one-half years each. Shimon Peres became the prime minister for the
                    first two and one -half years. His was not, in terms of policies, a government
                    of national unity, but rather a Labor Party government, and Peres himself began
                    to pursue peace process diplomacy which we welcomed. We worked very closely with
                    him.</p>
                <p>Let me step back to recall another element of our economic relationship which is
                    important. During that time, we negotiated with Israel a free trade area
                    agreement of the kind we have with Mexico and Canada. That was also part of our
                    larger effort to promote economic development and, ultimately, self
                    sufficiency.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Back to the coalition government. Peres was interested in furthering the peace
                    process. His vision of peace at that time and ours was to encourage Jordan as
                    the successor state in any kind of territorial transfer of the West Bank and
                    Gaza. For many years, the United States, because of its aversion to the PLO,
                    and, I think, lack of understanding of the Palestinian issue, thought that
                    Jordan should return to all or a portion of the West Bank, and should even
                    govern Gaza, which Egypt had controlled before 1967. All Israelis were opposed
                    to Palestinian control of the West Bank, and saw Jordan as a moderate and
                    potentially friendly neighbor. There was a long history of collaboration between
                    the Hashemite dynasty in Jordan and the Jews, beginning before 1948, since they
                    shared a common opposition to Palestinian nationalism.</p>
                <p>So we worked with the new Peres government to create an Arab negotiating
                    delegation that would be led by Jordan, with Palestinian representatives in a
                    subordinate status. For months we negotiated with the Israelis and the
                    Jordanians about a cast of Palestinians, that is non-PLO Palestinians, who would
                    be acceptable to Israel and could associate themselves with the Jordanian
                    delegation to carry out some preliminary discussions about peace. We also sought
                    funds from the Congress to enable Jordan which was the former occupying power
                    before 1967 in the West Bank, to carry out economic development programs in the
                    West Bank for Palestinians in an effort to strengthen its influence in the West
                    Bank among Palestinians. We assumed that King Hussein would speak for the
                    Palestinians. He had a cadre of supporters and former civil servants, who were
                    kept on the Jordanian payroll, in the West Bank. We did not envision the PLO as
                    a negotiation partner. Our diplomats were forbidden to talk to the PLO. We
                    regarded them as an intransigent terrorist organization, and did not foresee
                    that the PLO would change its policy.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, Washington's belief that the Palestinians would have accepted
                    Jordan back as the sovereign in the West Bank and Gaza was a serious
                    miscalculation. The Jordanian era between 1948 and '67 in the West Bank was an
                    unhappy memory for the Palestinians. Although many of them had family members in
                    Jordan, and many Palestinian refugees had fled there in 1948 or in '67,
                    Palestinian nationalism had emerged as a powerful force. If Israel had handed
                    back the West Bank to Jordan in 1967, history would have been different, but the
                    PLO and Palestinian nationalism developed growing momentum thereafter, and the
                    PLO clashed with Jordan in the Black September Palestinian uprising in Jordan in
                    1970, which sharpened the PLO-Jordanian divide. By that time, I doubt that there
                    was any realistic prospect that Jordan could have peacefully absorbed the West
                    Bank and its Palestinian populace, much less the Gazans. Indeed in 1987, King
                    Hussein, forswore Jordan's historic claim to the West Bank, telling the
                    Palestinians they were on their own. In my judgment, King Hussein recognized
                    that absorbing another two million Palestinians, would have severe destabilizing
                    effects on his own kingdom, where over half the people are already Palestinians.
                    His historical goal was to preserve the Hashemite dynasty, and absorption of the
                    West Bank would have created a dominant Palestinian majority that would not, for
                    long, acquiesce in Hashemite rule.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we looking at the Palestinians in this '84-'87
                        period? Were we beginning to sort of acknowledge to ourselves that there
                        really is sort of a thing as the Palestinians as a unique entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Only very slowly. As I say, the assumption was still that Jordan could
                    take care of the Palestinian issue. We did not support the notion of a
                    Palestinian state which the Palestinians were already talking about. Our view
                    toward the Palestinians had been heavily influenced by Israeli views and
                    Palestinian terrorism. There was too little appreciation of the weight and
                    strength of Palestinian nationalism. From the beginning there was inadequate
                    understanding in Washington, except among American diplomats who had served in
                    Jerusalem, about the Palestinian dimension of the conflict.</p>
                <p>Our vision of the conflict was skewed because of our profound attachment to
                    Israel and the lack of historical understanding about what had happened in 1948.
                    Because of a justifiable and understandable commitment to Israel's security and
                    the success of Israel after the Holocaust as a refuge for the Israelis, we lost
                    sight of the fact that the tragedy of the Jews in the holocaust which led to the
                    creation of the State of Israel brought forth another tragedy. The other tragedy
                    was the exodus of some 600,000-700,000 Palestinians from their homeland, many of
                    whom were forced out by Israeli forces, and the creation of a massive refugee
                    community.</p>
                <p>I think it is futile to try to weigh the tragedies of different people in terms
                    of relative suffering. The creation of the Palestinian Diaspora in historic
                    terms was not as profound an event as the extermination of six million Jews in
                    Europe and the destruction of the European Jewish community. Nevertheless, it
                    was a profound event for Palestinians and one that was certain to have enormous
                    consequences, as it did. The United States was focused on the tragedy of the
                    Jews, and did not take the full measure of the Palestinian tragedy, until they,
                    themselves, asserted themselves in various ways. First was a futile but noisy
                    and fearsome series of terrorist attacks which caught our attention, but
                    alienated American citizens and policymakers. Palestinian terrorism, rather than
                    creating sympathy, obscured the Palestinians' equities, and enabled the Israelis
                    to paint the PLO and the Palestinian national movement as essentially a
                    terrorist enterprise, determined to destroy Israel. Of course, the Israelis used
                    terrorism as a tactic against the British and the Arabs in their pre-48 struggle
                    for independence. Mainstream American views toward the Palestinians did not
                    change substantially until the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza launched a
                    civil revolt, known as the Intifada, that put a human face on the Palestinian
                    cause. It dramatized the anomaly of continued Israeli control over a subject
                    people who wanted their freedom.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No, the Intifada broke out in 1987 on the eve of my arrival in Jerusalem
                    as consul general.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about Jerusalem, you are talking about the
                        Palestinians. I want to talk about this time when you were in Washington
                        dealing with this. Were we beginning to develop a set of officers untainted
                        by sort of the old vision of the Arab as just plain anti-Israel that came
                        from missionary families. It was sort of a creation that I don't think was
                        ever there. Anyway, there was that taint. But a new set of men and women who
                        were beginning to deal with the Palestinians and looking at them you might
                        say Cold Warm blooded terms as far as communication.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Absolutely. We were. We did a wise thing many years ago by giving the
                    embassy in Tel Aviv responsibility for covering Gaza where there are almost a
                    million Palestinians, while the consul general in Jerusalem was responsible for
                    East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The focus of the consulate general was almost
                    exclusively Palestinian, and its diplomatic contacts were by and large with the
                    Palestinians whereas the embassy dealt with the government of Israel. But this
                    arrangement gave the embassy a window into Palestinian affairs in Gaza.
                    Reporting officers in the embassy would visit Gaza and got an appreciation
                    there. It is very difficult for officers who served in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to
                    have a sense of the other side of the conflict unless they had worked on it
                    themselves. I was very lucky to have been the director for Israeli and
                    Arab-Israeli Affairs before and a Deputy Assistant Secretary in NEA before I
                    went to Jerusalem. A core of officers was emerging who had served in both Israel
                    and the Arab world and who understood both sides of the problem. To deal
                    effectively with the Israeli-Palestinian issue, one must know both sides. I
                    think those of us who have worked the problem have a deep respect for both the
                    Israelis and the Palestinians and see these two communities caught up in a
                    terrible historic dilemma where they both have suffered and they both have
                    powerful equities and needs. That is what makes this a particularly compelling
                    and interesting conflict. There are powerful claims for justice, security,
                    identity recognition on both sides. The art of U.S. diplomacy should be to find
                    a compromise where the legitimate needs of both sides are recognized in a fair
                    way. For the last twenty years or so, the new generation of Middle East officers
                    in the Foreign Service are trying to do that. They have no illusions about the
                    failings of the Palestinians and the Israelis, but they respect both peoples'
                    and their basic desire for peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way it is easy when you look at the Arab-Israeli or
                        Israeli-Palestinian equation to see it almost as a zero sum game. The
                        territory is quite small. Was this a problem that you almost mentally had to
                        get over yourself to see that how can you reach a compromise.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Propaganda from both sides throughout the conflict had described it as a
                    zero sum game. For years, most Israelis believed, influenced heavily by
                    education and propaganda, that recognition of the PLO and creation of a
                    Palestinian state would be a slippery slope that would lead to a Palestinian
                    takeover of Israel. Palestinian and Arab hostility were primordial, they
                    thought, and thus the Israelis would have to occupy the West Bank and Gaza
                    forever or be themselves destroyed. This bleak view was strongly reinforced by
                    the ideological right in Israel that wanted to retain the West Bank and Gaza for
                    religious or nationalistic reasons. This element skillfully exploited Israelis
                    fears about security by framing the issue in terms of Israel's survival.</p>
                <p>The Palestinians were also slow to recognize the necessity of compromise. It took
                    them decades to recognize that the Israelis were there to stay, and to accept UN
                    Security Council Resolution 242 as the basis for a compromise peace and to
                    acknowledge the existence of Israel.</p>
                <p>The zero sum view is nonsense in my view. There is a ground for compromise which
                    most Palestinians and I think a majority of Israelis now support. That is, to
                    divide the land in an equitable way and create a Palestinian state in the West
                    Bank and Gaza. This has become vastly more complicated now because of the
                    encroachment of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, pushed by the
                    Israeli religious-nationalist element which believes they have a Biblical
                    obligation to reclaim all of the West Bank, which they refer to as Judea and
                    Samaria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But keeping to this '84-'87 period, did you see that the
                        Peres Labor government was someone who was a rational one you could deal
                        with and that the Shamir government which was coming up would be a
                        continuation of the Begin government and sort of this messianic outlook
                        towards the West Bank and Gaza? There would be, you know, almost
                        insurmountable problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In general, yes. We saw the Labor party as more disposed toward making
                    peace with the Palestinians and the Arabs. Peres himself began to develop very
                    expansive and attractive visions of Israel's integration into the Middle East,
                    relations with all the Arab states, and justice for the Palestinians. Washington
                    saw the Likud, because of its hard line ideology, as the more difficult party to
                    deal with. On the other hand, we recalled that Prime Minister Begin made peace
                    with Egypt and had agreed to Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai. So we didn't
                    despair working with a Likud government, and we continued to try to do so once
                    Shamir took over from Peres.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Let me go back a minute to our policy in general. We had helped to fashion a
                    series of Security Council resolutions in 1967 and 1974, Resolutions 242 and
                    338. 242 is basically the land for peace equation which envisaged an Israeli
                    withdrawal in return for peace from the Arab states. It did not define that
                    withdrawal precisely, but our view was that it would withdraw from the West Bank
                    and Gaza. 242 did not mention Jerusalem, but we also regard it as occupied
                    territory. 338 was a Security Council injunction to achieve a land for peace
                    settlement through negotiations. As for the Israeli settlement movement that
                    took root and gained momentum after 1967, we saw it as a growing danger that
                    would complicate an eventual territorial compromise and an Israeli
                    withdrawal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain the settlement movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The settlements were Israeli government sponsored, usually government
                    sponsored and financed towns. Israeli settlers, many of whom were religiously
                    motivated, have occupied settlements all over the West Bank and in part of Gaza.
                    The agenda of the settlement movement was to create an Israeli settler
                    population so large and so widespread as to make divestiture of the West Bank by
                    any Israeli government virtually impossible. U.S. officials who worked on the
                    problem from the beginning understood that, and believed that opposing
                    settlements should be a basic element of U.S. policy. The U.S. adopted the legal
                    position, recorded in a legal opinion by State Department Legal Adviser Herbert
                    Hansel during the Carter years, that settlements were a violation of the Fourth
                    Geneva Convention governing occupying powers, and were therefore illegal under
                    international law.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, President Reagan reversed this policy when he said in a press
                    conference that he did not believe settlements were illegal. Thereafter, U.S.
                    officials said only that settlements were an “obstacle to peace.” In recent
                    years, our declaratory policy has become even more attenuated and spokesman have
                    said merely that settlements are “unhelpful,” or that they are an issue that
                    must be negotiated. The failure of the U.S. to oppose settlements more
                    aggressively has encouraged successive Israeli governments, Likud and Labor, to
                    build more settlements. Today there are about 180,000 settlers in the West Bank,
                    not counting those in East Jerusalem, roughly 100,000 more than there were in
                    the mid-1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you dealing with these affairs when Reagan made this
                        pronouncement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I was still in the Bureau of International Organization affairs at the
                    time. We discussed with NEA trying to get the President to qualify or reverse
                    this, but this was not done. It turned out that the President knew what he was
                    saying. It was not a slip of the tongue. There were people in the
                    Administration, for example, Eugene Rostow, who thought the Israelis had a right
                    to occupy the West Bank and Gaza, and that the Fourth Geneva Convention was not
                    applicable. Rostow rejected the concept in Resolution 242 that the West Bank,
                    East Jerusalem, and Gaza were occupied territories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a subject. During this time, what was your
                        impression of the National Security Council and the advisors to the
                        president dealing with those affairs? This was a relatively ideological
                        president and one who, coming out of Hollywood and California and all, and I
                        think from his won roots, was highly sympathetic to Israel. Did you see his
                        advisors as being an obstacle to the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The NSC staff in those days lacked a clear understanding of the history
                    of the Middle East conflict. The area was seen very much through a Cold War
                    prism. The leadership of the Department of State being responsive to the
                    President did not take a markedly different approach, although George Shultz was
                    deeply interested in promoting peace in the Middle East. He invested a lot in
                    the so-called November 17 agreement in an effort to bring about an Israeli
                    withdrawal from Lebanon, and became deeply involved in the issue of terrorism
                    which outraged him. Stopping terrorism for Shultz became a very important part
                    of his agenda. Toward the end of his service, he began to search for ways to
                    reach out to the Palestinians. He actually tried to meet with a group
                    oPalestinians at the American Colony Hotel in East Jerusalem. They boycotted
                    him, which was a serious mistake.</p>
                <p>Shultz made a decision of historic importance when he recognized that the real
                    Palestinian interlocutor was going to have to be the PLO, or at least the U.S.
                    was going to have to engage in a dialogue with the PLO. NEA Assistant Secretary
                    Dick Murphy, a wise and experienced diplomat, understood this, and doubtless
                    influenced Shultz. Just before the end of the Reagan presidency, Shultz
                    authorized a process through private intermediaries, in which Murphy was heavily
                    involved, that led to the PLO's renunciation of terrorism and the beginning of
                    U.S.-PLO bilateral talks in Tunis where Bob Pelletreau was our ambassador at
                    that time. It was a politically courageous and wise thing to do. Historians
                    should give Shultz his due for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sitting in a position which is dealing with this
                        issue, during the time you were there, was there any sort of discussion of
                        dealing with the PLO as sort of something you just couldn't even put on
                        paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The engagement of the U.S. with the PLO came in part through private
                    parties, including liberal American Jews like Rita Hauser who were involved in
                    third track diplomacy. The Norwegians were also an intermediary. I think by that
                    time most Foreign Service officers recognized that the PLO had a mandate from
                    the Palestinian majority to represent it. I was convinced of that by the time I
                    got to Jerusalem. It was obvious that the PLO was not just Yasser Arafat. It was
                    the embodiment of Palestinian nationalism and their collective identity. To deal
                    with Palestinians, you had to deal with the PLO. And our elaborate efforts to
                    get the Jordanians to lead the Palestinians or to find some alternative
                    leadership were futile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But during this time, was it sort of an unstated fact of
                        life that you couldn't even write a paper suggesting that maybe we should
                        get together with the PLO, I mean '84,'85.'86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We felt constrained in that respect, since the PLO had been so demonized.
                    I, myself, as Director of Israeli and Arab-Israeli Affairs found some merit in
                    the idea that Jordan should play a major role. The idea of identifying
                    respectable non-PLO Palestinians also had some appeal. But, as I learned more
                    about the problem, I realized that the PLO was the address for the Palestinians,
                    and King Hussein's announcement of disengagement from the Palestinians in 1987
                    confirmed my view that the “Jordan option” was an illusion.</p>
                <p>At that time, the PLO did little to change U.S. attitudes toward it in a more
                    positive direction. It was still quite obdurate and there were a series of
                    terrorist acts which made things worse. The Achille Lauro hijacking by a faction
                    represented on the PLO executive committee and the murder of Leon Klinghoffer
                    hurt the Palestinians a lot. There had been a moderate, pragmatic current in the
                    PLO for years, but it did not emerge as preeminent until the Palestinian
                    National Congress in Algiers in 1988. There they produced a famous paper by
                    Bassam Abu Sharif, a former radical, saying that Israel and the PLO should make
                    peace on the basis of a two state solution, 242, and mutual recognition. That
                    was a seminal paper, but it wasn't recognized in the State Department as such at
                    the time. An internal debate was growing within the PLO, but it took the
                    Intifada to force a decisive shift in PLO policy toward peace and
                    compromise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick that up when you are in Jerusalem. What about
                        our reporting? Who was our consul general when you were in both dealing with
                        DAS and office directorate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The consul general was Morris Draper, and earlier, Wat Cluverius.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both of whom we have interviewed, by the way. What about
                        the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The Ambassador was Sam Lewis when I was director for Israeli affairs, and
                    Tom Pickering succeeded Sam Lewis. I worked closely with both of them. While I
                    was in Jerusalem, Tom was Ambassador. He left to go to the UN and Bill Brown who
                    had been the Deputy Chief of Mission under Sam Lewis and who had long experience
                    in Israeli affairs, became Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that Jerusalem at the time you were dealing
                        with those affairs was adequately represented in you might say the other
                        side of the hill from what was going on in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Jerusalem has always been a sought after post for Foreign Service
                    Officers, and there is an archive of superb political reporting and analysis
                    from the consulate general which goes way back. The officers who had served
                    there had more or less full access to the Palestinian leadership there. They
                    traveled freely, developed a deep knowledge of Palestinian politics, and turned
                    out, year after year, superb reporting on a real situation in the West Bank and
                    East Jerusalem. Reporting from Jerusalem was sometimes seen iWashington, with
                    its Israeli orientation and ignorance of Palestinian affairs, as special
                    pleading by diplomats who had been coopted by the Palestinians. Such
                    “clientitis” is, indeed, sometimes a problem in Foreign Service reporting. I
                    think in retrospect, most of the reporting of the consulate general has been
                    fair objective. It was controversial, since it reported anomalies of the Israeli
                    occupation that in earlier days were not well known and that contradicted the
                    more benign, pro-Israel view that often dominated. Although reporting from
                    Jerusalem foresaw much earlier than others what had to be done, the nature of
                    the problem, it was very seldom a decisive factor in U.S. policy because of the
                    pro-Israel orientation in Washington. I had the good fortune of having a superb
                    staff of young officers who did wonderful reporting. When that is open to
                    historians, it will shed a lot of light on the Intifada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about, again back to this time, Sam Lewis who
                        we also have an extensive interview with in our program. He was seen by many
                        of the people who served in the Arab countries as being succumbed to
                        localitis. He had been there for a long time and was a very influential
                        figure. How did you find both him and our embassy in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Sam served in Israel for eight years. He had not served in an Arab
                    country. He was an immensely capable, strong person. He carried a very heavy
                    burden during the Begin years in Israel, and on many occasions spoke very firmly
                    and frankly to the Israeli government on a host of issues where we were at odds
                    with them. I think he was always committed to a fair just peace, and he
                    understood that the Zionist nationalist Likud approach to the Arabs and the
                    peace process was not a tenable one. He had the confidence of President Reagan
                    and George Shultz, and they asked him to stay on, so he had a long tenure in Tel
                    Aviv. Sam had left Tel Aviv by the time I got there as consul general, having
                    been replaced by Tom Pickering. Sam was a key figure in our relationship with
                    Israel. Over the years he developed a strong attachment for Israel, and the need
                    for U.S. support, as did many others who served in Tel Aviv. Sam had little
                    personal or historical acquaintance with the Arab and Palestinian side of the
                    issue, and sometimes his views were at odds with those of our diplomats in Arab
                    posts. But Sam was not a patsy for the Israelis, and in critical moments he
                    could be tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the feeling about the Palestinians because I
                        have one of my Arabist friends who said look no matter how you slice it, I
                        wouldn't trust the Palestinians at all because they can be swayed and if the
                        Israelis are really worried about their security, it is all very nice to
                        talk about agreements. Political leaders can rise. The Israelis have a real
                        problem, and that is that an Arab neighbor is not a safe neighbor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I think that the ultimate security for Israel lies not in creating a
                    military fortress confronting its Arab neighbors, but in making peace with them.
                    In order to make peace on a broader level beyond just Egypt and Jordan, the
                    Israelis will have to make a deal with the Palestinians. The Arab states by and
                    large are ambivalent about the Palestinians. They have postured about the
                    Palestinian cause, but the have done little for the Palestinians. Indeed some
                    Arab leaders may see the Palestinians as a threat because the Palestinians, in
                    part because of their proximity to the Israelis over the years have developed a
                    more progressive approach to politics. The Palestinians are also energetic
                    business people and generally well educated. Until recently, there was
                    ambivalence in the Arab Middle East about a Palestinian state which might become
                    a democracy and serve as a destabilizing example for Arabs ruled by autocratic
                    regimes. The security dilemma for Israel is real because Israel was created on
                    land which was taken from the Palestinians in war, a great many of whom were
                    expelled by force. However, 50 years later, Israel has become a powerful,
                    successful state. No Arab government today believes that Israel can be dislodged
                    or that it is a temporary phenomenon. Back in the '70s, Arabs used to talk about
                    how the crusaders came to and left Palestine, and that Israel would go the same
                    way. I don't think any Arab politician believes that today. Moreover, the
                    Israeli-Palestinian issue has less salience for them now as the increasingly
                    realize that they have got to deal with their own internal problems to survive,
                    and that they cannot wave the anti-Zionist banner as a way of diverting public
                    attention from their own misgovernment or failures. So the Arab states no longer
                    present a significant security threat to Israel, which is vastly stronger, and
                    most of them are prepared to follow Egypt and Jordan and make peace with Israel
                    and establish relations if Israel can negotiate a fair deal with the
                    Palestinians.</p>
                <p>The Palestinians have no military wherewithal and understand better than anyone
                    that Israel is a powerful and permanent state. On the other hand, the huge
                    Palestinian community can make life unpleasant for Israelis if there is no fair
                    peace settlement. The Palestinians are also there to stay, and they are not
                    going to abandon their cause.</p>
                <p>A comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace thus depends on resolving the Palestinian
                    issue. Peace with the Palestinians and all the Arabs does not mean they will
                    love each other. The legacy of the Arab-Israeli wars and the Palestinian issue
                    will go on for many years. The Israelis will not become Palestinian
                    nationalists, and the Palestinians will not become Zionists. But love isn't
                    necessary to achieve peace.</p>
                <p>Israel by virtue of its small size and exposed borders in a region of the world
                    that will probably be unstable, even after an Arab-Israeli peace, will retain
                    strong military forces. But military superiority will not achieve peace with the
                    Palestinians and an end to this conflict as long as Israel continues to occupy
                    most of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. This conflict is not
                    primordial, and can be resolved. Israeli settlements in the occupied territories
                    and Jerusalem make a territorial division more difficult, but this can still be
                    done and a Palestinian state can be created that will be acceptable to
                    Palestinians. If so, the Arabs will fall in line.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>As for whether Palestinians are untrustworthy, I mistrust such ethnic
                    stereotypes. People sometimes act in their own interest, sometimes they don't.
                    The Palestinians are now acting in their own interest in opting for a
                    compromise. I think they made a profound and wise decision to shift from
                    rejectionism, confrontation and violence to the search for peace. Ex- Prime
                    Minister Rabin deserves the same credit for accepting the need for doing that. I
                    fear that the present Minister Netanyahu has a different vision that is bad for
                    Israel, not to mention the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well speaking of sort of ethnic stereotypes, was there any
                        thought given, going back to this time when you were in a position of
                        responsibility, for going for what could be on historical terms, the natural
                        proclivities of the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Lebanese for
                        dominating commerce. I think this has been shown wherever these people have
                        gone. I mean in the heart of Africa, you have Lebanese traders. We are
                        talking about the Levantines. Say cut it out fellows. You are damn good
                        merchants, and you can probably take on any aggregate of other people in the
                        world and beat them at their own game in the mercantile world. Was there any
                        thought of looking ahead to something of this nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. I have always believed that. There is an extraordinary symbiosis
                    between the Israelis and the Palestinians. They have lived next to each other
                    for decades. They have both suffered historic tragedies. They both believe
                    profoundly in education as the most important investment. They are hard working,
                    enterprising people. There are probably more Ph.D.'s per capita among
                    Palestinians around the world than any other society in the world, and there are
                    a disproportionate number among the Jews. The potential for cooperation and
                    profitable trade, industry, other kinds of exchanges between the Palestinians
                    and the Israelis are terrific. The Palestinians could serve as the bridge to the
                    rest of the Arab world for the Israelis. And the Palestinians and the Israelis
                    both need each other to create a harmonious and functional environment. They use
                    the same water. Their communities are now so intertwined that in order to avoid
                    strife, they have to figure out ways to get along with each other, and to gain
                    from their relationship. It may be idealistic, but I think in practical terms a
                    partnership between Israel and a Palestinian state which is negotiated in a just
                    and equitable way could be successful. These people have much in common. The
                    idea that they are locked in a permanent confrontation need not be true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were this is the '84-'87 period, was the thought
                        of a Palestinian state around, being batted around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WILCOX: It was at the leading edge of the agenda of the PLO, the Palestinian
                    Diaspora and the West Bank and Gaza Palestinian community, but there were still
                    those in Washington who were promoting the so called Jordan Option. But, at that
                    time, the Palestinian leadership had not abandoned the position that Israel
                    should not be accepted and that Palestinians should someday reclaim all of
                    Palestine. There was some ambivalence about the PLO among a minority in the West
                    Bank who had strong ties to Jordan.</p>
                <p>During this period, the Palestinians still felt abandoned and were in many
                    respects a very demoralized community. Many of them had been dispossessed of
                    their land and homes in Israel and they been living first under Jordanian and
                    then under Israeli occupation for 40 years. They had experienced a serious of
                    convulsions going all the way back to the British era. Because of this sense of
                    weakness and demoralization, Palestinians tended to cling to the past and to
                    take highly principled, absolutist positions concerning Israel. They were unable
                    or unwilling to articulate or admit what they really understood, that the
                    Israelis were there and were not going to leave, and that the Palestinians were
                    not going to return to their homes in what is now Israel.</p>
                <p>This self deception and lack of realism did not change until the Intifada
                    erupted. By confronting Israel for the first time with the anomaly of occupation
                    and the grossly unequal status of the Palestinians and catching the attention of
                    the world as a people with legitimate and compelling grievances, the
                    Palestinians regained a sense of self confidence. The Intifada was an expression
                    of suppressed anger, especially by the young, who objected to the rather passive
                    acquiescence and adaptation to Israeli rule that they saw in their elders. It
                    baffled and frightened the Israelis, who were entirely unprepared.</p>
                <p>The Palestinians gained and held the initiative in terms of world opinion, and
                    this gave them new confidence. This confidence enabled them to become more
                    realistic and pragmatic about their situation, Israel, and the encrusted
                    positions that they and the PLO had taken for years in rejecting any compromise.
                    Recognizing that compromise was essential, they pushed Arafat and the external
                    PLO, who were also caught by surprise by the Intifada, to accept resolution 242
                    and to renounce claims to Israel, changes in doctrine that led to a dialogue
                    with the U.S. and ultimately to thMadrid conference and then to the Oslo peace
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again this is before the Intifada again I keep dating back
                        '84-'87, what was your and NEA's reading on Arafat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Very skeptical. We recognized his popularity, but we did not recognize
                    him as a statesman. We thought he was rigid, mired in the past, and a supporter
                    of terrorism. There was information that he might have sanctioned the
                    Palestinian attack on our embassy in Khartoum where Cleo Noel and Curtis Moore
                    were murdered. No one in Washington liked Arafat, or recognized that he was the
                    pre-eminent Palestinian leader with whom the U.S. and Israel would have to deal
                    with some day. We saw Arafat as part of the problem, not the solution. Arafat
                    seemed to be just the kind of Palestinian leader that the Israeli hard liners
                    wanted because they could point to him as a man who espoused violence and was
                    intransigent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking for a successor to Arafat, the
                        “moderate”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We didn't have much knowledge about the expatriate Palestinian community
                    because we didn't talk to them. The last contacts we had with them were in
                    Lebanon during the early '80s when our intelligence officials there had a
                    dialogue with the PLO. This gave us some insight but the principle reason for
                    these contacts was the protection of American officials there from terrorist
                    attacks. We had unwisely acceded to Israeli pressure to avoid any contacts with
                    the PLO in the form of a commitment from President Ford until the PLO met our
                    conditions. This denied us contact with a key player, insights into the
                    complexity oPLO politics, which included moderate as well as extremist trends,
                    and the opportunity to use diplomacy to push the PLO toward greater moderation
                    and realism. In retrospect, our self imposed isolation from the PLO was a
                    serious policy failure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are those who have given oral l histories saying
                        that we were being protected in Lebanon by the PLO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, that is true, but our limited contacts with the PLO in Beirut were
                    no substitute for diplomatic contacts. The negotiations over the departure of
                    the PLO from Lebanon after the Lebanon war in which we gained safe passage for
                    Arafat and the Palestinians was an early step toward the change in our
                    relationship. We also strongly protested the Israeli bombing of the Palestinian
                    headquarters in Tunis. There were Americans, Jews and others, who recognized at
                    early stage that it was important to talk to Arafat, and private Americans began
                    contacts with him in the early 1980s. When George Shultz realized at the end of
                    the Reagan administration that we needed to work with the PLO, and we ultimately
                    got commitments from Arafat, through third parties, including a renunciation of
                    violence, [which] led to the beginning of the U.S.-PLO dialogue in Tunis, I
                    believe in late 1988. That dialogue was terminated or interrupted after the
                    abortive attack at Herzliya outside Tel Aviv by Palestinians guerillas loyal to
                    the radical splinter Abu Abbas faction. Although Arafat condemned the attack, he
                    did not expel Abu Abbas from the Executive Committee, as Washington had demanded
                    as the price for continuing our dialogue.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>We didn't resume the dialogue until after the Madrid process. Even in the Madrid
                    process and the events that led up to that, we did not acknowledge that Arafat
                    and the PLO would be our main interlocutor. We thought there might be some
                    constellation of local Palestinians with whom we might deal, associated with
                    Jordan. As you recall, Jim Baker met only with Palestinians from the West Bank
                    and Gaza, and the delegation at the Madrid conference was still a
                    Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. The Israelis insisted on that and we acceded
                    to it. The Israeli-Palestinian talks that followed Madrid in Washington involved
                    onlPalestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, although by then everyone knew they
                    got their instructions from the PLO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading on Shamir when he came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: A tough guy, committed to retention of the West Bank and Gaza. U.S.
                    officials respected Shamir as a man who spoke honestly and candidly. He had a
                    certain kind of solid quality about him. At the same time, we saw him as a
                    narrow hard liner and not the man who was going to make those tough decisions
                    that Israel had to make. He didn't. He fought Jim Baker's effort, and he lost,
                    and Baker dragged him into the Madrid conference with very resourceful
                    diplomacy. Shamir was always opposed to making any concession for peace or to
                    talking to the PLO. He admitted later that Madrid for him was just a holding
                    action and that he never intended to relinquish an inch of territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I am sure there are other things we should be
                        talking about on Israel. Is there anything in other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There is a strain in Israeli politics and political culture that has been
                    there from the very beginning, but became much stronger after 1967 and the
                    election of the Likud in 1977, that is committed to the recovery of the Biblical
                    land of Israel. These “Zionist Revisionists” do not see Israel or the Jewish
                    people as living in peace and harmony with the rest of the world, but as a
                    people destined to live alone and forever at odds with the gentile world. In
                    their view, Jews, in order to redress previous wrongs and protect themselves
                    against further persecution in the future, must be strong and
                    uncompromising.</p>
                <p>This political ideology is a deviation from traditional, universalist Jewish
                    values, and pays less attention to considerations of justice and equity, at
                    least with respect to dealing with the Arabs, who are seen as implacable
                    enemies. This strain of Jewish ideology emerged early in the century, but was
                    strengthened and made more extreme by the Holocaust. It is the ideology of the
                    Likud Party and groups even further to the right than the Likud. In recent
                    years, this element in Israeli politics has been making common cause with the
                    ultra orthodox factions, who are increasingly anti-Arab.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The major influx of Russian Jews didn't take place until the Gorbachev
                    era. There was a long effort by American Jewish organizations and the
                    governments of Israel and the U.S. to persuade the Soviet Union to release the
                    Jews that wanted to emigrate. At first Moscow refused, but a massive wave of
                    Russian Jews to Israel began in the Gorbachev era and accelerated after the
                    Soviet Union fell. The majority were Russians. They have had a big impact on
                    Israel.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: I went to Jerusalem in early spring of 1988.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1988. We were talking about Arab-Israeli affairs. Did that
                        have a further response?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: As a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, I worked on Lebanon, Egypt,
                    Jordan and Syria, as well as Israel and the Palestinians. Throughout my service
                    in NEA, the center of influence and decision making for the peace process moved
                    to the seventh floor from NEA, because of its political sensitivity and
                    importance. Charlie Hill, who was Secretary Shultz's Executive Assistant and who
                    had served in Israel, was a very key figure in our peace process policy. In
                    recent years, the power has shifted from the immediate office of the Secretary
                    to the office of the Special Coordinator for Middle East (SMEC) who reports to
                    the Secretary. Moving the center of influence from the NEA bureau to the seventh
                    floor and the White House occurred as the issue became ever more entwined with
                    domestic politics. I think at times, it has deprived the process of the kind of
                    expertise and knowledge that is needed. Dennis Ross, who formerly did this work
                    on the NSC staff, has held the SMEC job for many years. He had come from the
                    University of California at Berkeley where he was a Soviet expert, worked for
                    Defense, and joined the NSC staff in the late 1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is something I've noticed as I have done these
                        interviews with anyone looking at our diplomatic process. At a certain
                        point, when things get critical, there is a tendency to move it to the
                        secretary's level or to the NSC where unfortunately there is a tendency to
                        figure out how will this play in the United States, how will this play in
                        the press, with Congress, and if we get those, who is going to pay for it..
                        In any crisis, and often it doesn't take into account how people in country
                        X react. I think the major one was with George Shultz putting together his
                        wonderful peace thing while our Ambassador in Syria, Bob Paganelli, was
                        saying Assad won't buy it. I mean this is a classic, but it happens again
                        and again</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I agree. Nevertheless, there have been some career diplomats who made
                    their mark in the peace process, although the power has gravitated elsewhere.
                    The reasons for the “domestication” of our foreign policy is based, in part, on
                    the fact that our political system relies heavily on money. Politicians need to
                    raise funds, and they are therefore unduly responsible to constituent groups and
                    lobbies who can raise money. This is ultimately a corrupting influence. It
                    affects both parties. It has brought more and more political people into senior
                    decision making roles at State, and into Ambassadorial jobs, who are not there
                    because of their expertise but because of patronage. I don't know how to reverse
                    this trend without reforming campaign financing.</p>
                <p>Let me emphasize thaI don't think that foreign policy should be exclusively the
                    domain of Foreign Service officers or technocrats. It must be linked to the
                    democratic process, but there ought to be a better way to do it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Just one year. It was 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about looking at some of the other countries. What
                        about how were things developing in Egypt at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We had a close relationship with Egypt on the political and military
                    level. We had great esteem for Egypt because it was the first of the Arab states
                    to recognize Israel, and that gave it a very special place in the Arab world for
                    us. There were no major crises in our relationship. We were very worried about
                    economic development and the lack of real progress in creating jobs and building
                    a more modern economy in Egypt, but we had close relations across the board. We
                    were dissatisfied that the peace between Israel and Egypt had not resulted in a
                    kind of spontaneous opening of commercial, social, cultural relations. It was,
                    as the Israelis described it, a cold peace. The Egyptian intelligentsia
                    continued to oppose Israel in very strident terms, our hopes that Egypt-Israeli
                    peace would be a catalyst for broader Arab-Israeli contacts were
                    disappointed.</p>

                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WILCOX: We always had a special relationship with King Hussein, and at one time
                    provided very large levels of aid to Jordan. Those declined as our aid budget
                    declined. Our main interest in Jordan was as an important player in the peace
                    process. Jordan has been a successful state in many ways, creating a nation
                    under difficult circumstances. King Hussein was regarded as a moderate, and one
                    of the keys to solving the Palestinian issue. Traditionally, the Hashemites had
                    a more pragmatic and accommodating view toward Zionism and Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Relations were very strained because of Syria's rigid anti-Israel policy,
                    its policies in Lebanon, and its active support, in the 1980s of terrorism. The
                    Syrians tried to engineer the bombing of an El-Al aircraft after it took off
                    from Heathrow in 1986, but security agents discovered the bomb before the plane
                    took off. As a result, the U.S. designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism
                    and imposed widespread sanctions.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we continued to recognize that Syria was an important player
                    in the peace process. It was a big country with a big army, close relations with
                    what was then the Soviet Union, and the only country which posed any kind of
                    military threat to Israel. We saw the Golan Heights as another area where the
                    land for peace equation under Resolution 242 should be applied, and realized
                    that Syria also was a critical player in the future of Lebanon. Relations were
                    strained. The Syrians didn't make any effort to improve relations either; they
                    were tough and stubborn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, it does sound that this wasn't an easy group to

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Assad is an Alawite whose government is a minority, and highly
                    authoritarian. Assad has used the anti-Zionist issue as a way of maintaining
                    unity and support for his regime. He has allowed the economy to languish, and
                    Syria is a backward country, though it has real potential. Syria, of course, is
                    a new nation which emerged out of the old British and French empires. It is not
                    yet a mature state.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WILCOX: We were still involved in the aftermath of the civil war, and the hostage
                    crises. Because of our deep frustration over the hostages, effective lobbying by
                    hostage members' families, and an unrelated need for covert money to arm the
                    contras in Nicaragua, we got involved in a hare brained fiasco which violated
                    our own laws, the Iran-Contra scandal. It was run by Ollie North and the NSC out
                    of the basement of the White House, and which caused a grave crisis for the
                    Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>When Secretary Shultz, who had been kept out of the plot, learned what was going
                    on, he realized the need to deal with it publicly and repair the damage. A
                    special prosecutor was named as this unhappy chapter in American foreign policy
                    was revealed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that affect you in NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: NEA didn't know anything about the shenanigans Ollie and others were
                    carrying on. There was tight secrecy, so the Secretary of State and the
                    Department were out in the cold. This disaster occurred because irresponsible
                    and uninformed staffers were given great power. Their enthusiasm greatly
                    exceeded their competence, and we came a cropper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see during this '84-'87, particularly '87 period,
                        did we see Lebanon as being part of because there were Israeli troops. There
                        still are in south Lebanon. Did we see this as being part of the general
                        peace complex?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We did, and we worked hard, George Shultz worked hard in an effort to
                    solve it. As you pointed out, we did not engage the Syrians in the negotiations,
                    so it was doomed to failure. We did not strenuously oppose the initial Israeli
                    invasion of Lebanon, and it is true that Al Haig was sympathetic to this venture
                    gave the Israelis at least a “yellow light.” But later we worked very hard to
                    get the Israelis to withdraw, with effective diplomacy by Phil Habib and Morrie
                    Draper. We saw Lebanon as a source of instability, danger, and terrorism,
                    especially by the militant Shia Muslim Hezbollah. The Israeli and Hezbollah
                    confrontation in southern Lebanon was another flash point, so we engineered
                    resolution 425, calling for withdrawal of all foreign forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By '87, did you see Lebanon as being a functional
                        government or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The government did not govern in substantial parts of the country. In the
                    south where there was the Israeli army and Hezbollah militias. In the Bekka
                    Valley which the Hezbollah and the Syrians were in charge. The Syrians also had
                    troops elsewhere, including iBeirut, so the government was not entirely in
                    charge of the country. Lebanese politics, were still characterized by a lot of
                    sectarian strife, and there were few politicians of any stature.</p>

                        an embassy or two blown up.WILCOX: The embassy was bombed twice, and the
                        Marine barracks was blown up. We had made a commitment to stay the course in
                        Lebanon, but the bombing of the Marine barracks led to withdrawal of our
                        forces. We made a mistake by allowing our peacekeeping forces to be drawn
                        into the conflict as protagonists. We also deployed them in a vulnerable
                        place with poor perimeter defenses.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There were constant recommendations that the place was just too exposed.
                    We had lost so many Americans there. But, NEA persuaded the senior level that it
                    was important to keep a base there with an ambassador and reporting officers to
                    maintain contact and keep Washington informed. We did, however, forbid the
                    travel of Americans using American passports to Lebanon. That travel ban was
                    lifted in 1997 by Secretary Albright. I think the travel ban lasted too long,
                    since the threat of terrorism had declined considerably by the mid-1990s.
                    Telling Americans they cannot travel somewhere is an extreme measure, and it is,
                    in a sense, a surrender to terrorists. Still, this was necessary in Lebanon in
                    the earlier days when terrorism and hostage taking was rife. But we kept it in
                    force too long.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: I had been serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary in NEA with
                    responsibility for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. I
                    previously had been Director for Arab and Arab-Israeli affairs, so I was
                    prepared for Jerusalem, and when I was asked to go, I readily agreed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I don't think there was any vetting process outside of the
                    administration. I had been involved in the issue and the policy and knew the
                    players, including the Israelis and the leaders of the American Jewish
                    community, and I was qualified by experience for the job</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By any chance during this time that you were in

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, I knew Martin quite well. He was the Director for Research at AIPAC,
                    and I had considerable contact with him while I was on the Israel and
                    Arab-Israel desk, and when I became Deputy Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, I mean where was he coming from
                        during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: He had by the time I left NEA, Martin had already moved over to the job
                    of Director of the newly-created Washington Institute for Middle East Policy
                    Studies. Some of the board members of the Institute were also directors of
                    AIPAC, so there was an intimate relationship between the two groups. Martin
                    himself had been a scholar in his earlier days in Australia and had written his
                    doctoral thesis on the Egypt-Israel peace process, and so he had expertise on
                    the area. I worked with him and other officials of AIPAC when I was on the
                    Israeli desk. It was a friendly, but often adversarial relationship, since AIPAC
                    often opposed administration policies concerning the Middle East, Israel, and
                    the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that AIPAC reflected the politics of Israel
                        in that you had equivalent to the Likud which takes a very strong and
                        pro-Israeli line as opposed to Labor which is how can we get along in this
                        difficult part of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WILCOX: AIPAC came of age during the Likud era after 1977 and it grew into a very
                    skilled, well financed and sophisticated lobby. AIPAC's role was to enhance the
                    American-Israeli relationship, and it generally reflected views put forth by the
                    government of Israel. It worked very hard to promote stronger support in
                    Congress, and later began to give attention to the executive branch, the
                    Department of State and the Department of Defense. It had an effective, capable
                    group of people who were knowledgeable, dedicated, hard working, tough, and
                    single minded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it seem to reflect, most of the time in the people who
                        were brought on were true believers even to use an old biblical term zealots
                        as far as the cause of a greater Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No, I wouldn't call them zealots. I think that the leadership in AIPAC
                    were people who believed deeply that a strong U.S.-Israel [relationship] was
                    valuable for the United States, that our interests converged in all major
                    respects. The major point of friction with AIPAC during that time were U.S. arms
                    sales to Arab states, and AIPAC worked aggressively to prevent or postpone or to
                    subject to conditions the sale of U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other
                    Arab states which had not made peace with Israel. AIPAC argued that to sell
                    sophisticated weapons to these states would erode the qualitative military edge
                    that it was U.S. policy to preserve for the state of Israel. So there were very
                    difficult and almost chronic disputes whenever an Arab state would propose to
                    purchase U.S. arms, and AIPAC would almost invariably oppose them. AIPAC also
                    preached the Israel view that it was necessary to retain the West Bank and Gaza
                    for security reasons, that there were no moderate Arab states, and that the
                    Palestinians were permanently committed to the violent destruction of
                    Israel.</p>

                        area was kind of keyed up. Okay, we wanted to go back to AIPAC first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX:. AIPAC was opposed to the administration's view that the basis for peace
                    lay in a land for peace arrangement based on resolution 242. We were also at
                    odds with AIPAC over the question of the PLO office in Washington. The
                    administration realized that this office, which was run by American citizens,
                    would continue operations under some other name if it was closed down, but
                    eventually acceded to strong pressure from the Congress and from AIPAC to shut
                    down the office. As usual, AIPAC played very hard ball on this issue.</p>
                <p>AIPAC is a single issue organization. Its members lacked the knowledge and
                    perspective of other foreign policy issues and for that reason, did not have the
                    understanding that there were other U.S. interests that had to be weighed in
                    considering our policy toward Israel and the peace process. So at times it was
                    an adversarial relationship. But the Administration also recognized AIPAC's
                    influence and courted its able Director at that time, Tom Dine, as an important
                    player.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue raised say particularly with Saudi Arabia,
                        because Saudi Arabia was essentially no threat to Israel. It just didn't
                        have the military capacity, the population. Was the protection of the
                        Persian Gulf, because this obviously became very important in our next
                        episode we are going to be discussing, but was that raised at all with AIPAC
                        saying, you know fellows this is all very nice but Saudi Arabia is being
                        threatened by both Iran and Iraq, and we have to have AWACS and protective
                        weapons and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: That, of course, was part of our case. It usually didn't prevail with
                    AIPAC or Congress. The administration won an early fight with AIPAC and Congress
                    over the sale of AWACS surveillance aircraft to Saudi Arabia. After that defeat,
                    AIPAC vowed that it would never be defeated again in such a stand up contest. It
                    wasn't. I believe that AIPAC was every bit as concerned about its own power and
                    influence as Israel's interests. Steve Rosen, AIPAC Director for Research who
                    succeeded Martin Indyk, once acknowledged this to me, saying “we are a fighting
                    organization, and we like to win.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then let's move to Jerusalem. At the beginning
                        things obviously really heated up. Let's talk about when you arrived there
                        in '88. What was the situation? We are talking about the whole area, but
                        basically centered around Jerusalem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, at that time the Likud government and Prime Minister Shamir were
                    governing Israel. Its policy was to promote the Israeli settlements and to hang
                    on to the West Bank and Gaza which they regarded as part of greater Israel. The
                    Likud never proclaimed an intention to annex these areas and absorb them into
                    Israel, realizing that were they to do so, the Palestinians in those areas would
                    have to be enfranchised. That would upset the Jewish demographics of Israel.
                    Still, they wanted to maintain control of these territories under some form of
                    limited autonomy where the major decisions and security would be controlled by
                    Israel. To prevent the emergence of a local Palestinian leadership and self
                    governing institutions, the Israelis removed or deported Palestinian mayors, for
                    example, who had nationalist views, and appointed Arabs who were puppets. Local
                    leadership, therefore, scarcely existed. The Palestinian PLO leadership abroad
                    was in retreat having been driven out of Beirut and landed in exile in Tunisia.
                    There was a deep stalemate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had the previous incumbents reported from Jerusalem?
                        How did they perceive their missions as consuls general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think reporting from Jerusalem over the years made a real effort to try
                    to understand the dynamics of Palestinian politics, the society, the economy of
                    the West Bank. The embassy was responsible for Gaza.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>As for the role of consuls general, by definition they all led schizophrenic
                    lives, living in West Jerusalem among Israelis, and dealing professionally with
                    Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. I and some of my predecessors
                    thought it was important to keep and eye on the Jewish side of Jerusalem to keep
                    our Palestinian analysis in context and to look at the city as a whole. While my
                    official contacts were with the Palestinians, since Israel prohibited its
                    officials from dealing with the consulate, I also developed very close contacts
                    with Israeli writers, journalists and academics, especially those who were
                    interested and involved in the peace process and human rights and had contacts
                    with Palestinians. In any case, I viewed my role as the American representative
                    in the City of Jerusalem, as well as our channel to the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>While the bulk of our contacts were with Palestinians and we concentrated our
                    reporting on that sector, I gained perspective and insight by keeping in touch
                    with Israelis. Our job, of course, was to encourage the Palestinians to take a
                    more creative and positive view toward peace.</p>
                <p>By and large, it was not possible to bring Palestinians and Israelis together at
                    the consulate because of the depth of Palestinian feelings about the occupation
                    and their Israeli adversaries and the embarrassment they felt in associating
                    with Israelis under American auspices in a setting they could only regard as
                    political, not social. We did so only on rare, carefully controlled occasions.
                    Nor did we try to bring together peace-minded Israelis whom we knew were already
                    in touch with Palestinians, since this probably would have been
                    counterproductive. These relations were close, though very discreet, and did not
                    need U.S. sponsorship.</p>
                <p>The only major mixed event at the consulate was our annual Fourth of July
                    reception. In the past, following the practice of other consulate generals in
                    Jerusalem, the U.S. held two receptions, one for Palestinians and the other for
                    Israelis. One of my predecessors, Wat Cluverius, broke with this tradition and
                    combined the two parties. I agreed with this policy, since it was designed to
                    demonstrate that the U.S. saw the Jews and the Arabs in Jerusalem as neighbors
                    who had to live together. The Palestinians saw our policy differently, however,
                    and some of them regularly boycotted the event, while otherwise maintained close
                    relations with us. I think they suspected that holding a Fourth of July
                    reception for both communities implied that the U.S. had accepted Israeli
                    control over all of Jerusalem and had abandoned the policy of leaving the
                    question of Jerusalem's status open for future negotiations. That certainly
                    wasn't the intention of having a single reception, but all things in Jerusalem
                    are political including Fourth of July receptions. Mayor Teddy Kollek of
                    Jerusalem made things worse for us by constantly saying in public that he was
                    responsible for persuading the U.S. to hold a combined Fourth of July reception.
                    This made it look to the Palestinians that we were doing the Israelis' bidding,
                    which was not true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your talk just now, you always state in Jerusalem and
                        Jerusalem and Jerusalem. What about the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The West Bank was under our jurisdiction, and I and all my predecessors
                    traveled extensively in the West Bank, using our Arab drivers. We used Israeli
                    drivers in West Jerusalem. My officers were out in the West Bank every day
                    talking to people, administering a small economic development assistance
                    program, promoting U.S. views, and trying continuously to persuade the
                    Palestinians to take a more activist and positive view toward the peace process
                    and to accept resolution 242.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what resolution 242 was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Resolution 242 has always been the foundation of U.S. policy in the peace
                    process. Essentially, it calls on Israel to withdraw from territory occupied in
                    1967, that is the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, in exchange for peace and
                    mutual recognition. is essentially a bargain for the exchange of land for peace.
                    Resolution 338 calls for the negotiations to bring that process about. The
                    Palestinians for years had been paralyzed in their political approach by
                    refusing to recognize the existence or the permanence of the state of Israel.
                    They clung tenaciously to this view in public that because Israel had taken
                    their land, they had a right to recover it and compromise with Israel was not
                    acceptable. I think most of them did not believe that this was a realistic
                    policy, but nevertheless, they would not bring themselves to admit that, and for
                    reasons of pride they clung to this uncompromising position. So there was a
                    terrible intellectual and ideological lag among the Palestinians on the West
                    Bank. Their policy was one of steadfastness, to hold firm to their views and to
                    hope that somehow someday their cause would prevail. It wasn't prevailing. Their
                    land continued to be taken by the Israelis, settlements were expanding, and
                    steadfastness was a failed policy. We worked to urge the Palestinians to look at
                    their own situation more realistically, to find ways to engage with Israel, and
                    to make peace through a compromise that would salvage something for them and
                    their children. Our view was the only route to peace was a division of the land
                    and a mutual recognition between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
                <p>This was a hard sell, not just because of traditional Palestinian stubbornness
                    and the lack of strong, visionary leadership, but because the Likud governments
                    in those days offered the Palestinians little in return for peace. “Peace for
                    peace” was Shamir's policy, and he envisaged a future of permanent subordination
                    of the Palestinians under effective Israeli control, since his view and that of
                    his colleagues was that the West Bank and Gaza belonged to Israel. It was
                    difficult, to say the least, for the Palestinians to recognize Israel when
                    Israel refused to offer any compromise itself or to recognize the Palestinian as
                    a people with rights and aspirations of their own. The Israelis until well into
                    the late '80s clung to the view that the Palestinians were basically Jordanians,
                    and that Palestinian nationalism and the idea of a Palestinian state were not
                    only illegitimate but dangerous. So there was a grave ideological time warp on
                    both sides. Both thought they were stuck in a zero sum game in which one side
                    had to win and the other had to lose.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have dealings with the Jewish settlers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, we did. We would meet occasionally with settler representatives in
                    Jerusalem, and members of my staff would sometimes visit settlements and talk to
                    settlement leaders. It was important to learn more about it and to report on the
                    internal politics and dynamics of this movement, which represented a threat to
                    an ultimate peace. We also reported in great detail on the expansion of
                    settlements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you viewed with hostility by the settlement
                        leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Absolutely. The leadership of the settler movement were religious
                    fundamentalists and ultra-nationalist Jews who believed that they were
                    fulfilling a Biblical prophesy by reclaiming the ancient Biblical homelands and
                    had a God given right to take that land and to live on it. The Palestinians
                    would somehow have to make do or leave. They were deeply angry at the U.S. for
                    suggesting that settlements were a threat to peace and stability in the region.
                    Up until the early 1980s, the U.S. government held that settlements were
                    illegal. Unfortunately, President Reagan changed our policy, and our opposition
                    to settlements thereafter was more attenuated and spasmodic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find when you were there particularly dealing with
                        the settlers, much of the impetus for this movement was being supported
                        particularly in Jewish circles in New York I would have thought. Almost
                        everything you did would be on a hair trigger, and the hair trigger would be
                        almost in New York. New York City I am talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The impetus for the settlement movement didn't come from New York, it
                    came from the various Zionist revisionist ideologues and religious leaders like
                    Rabbi Kook who created a new variant of Jewish philosophy which held that to
                    recover the land of ancient Israel was a divine mandate, central to the future
                    of Judaism and linked to the coming of the messiah. This was a very powerful
                    concept emotionally and religiously. It grew after the Israeli victory in 1967
                    and the take over of the West Bank which the followers of this stream of Judaism
                    saw as a miraculous act of redemption. It is true that this movement drew
                    support and funds from some American Jewish donors and religious cohorts. Also,
                    a significant number of the most enthusiastic and ideological settlers were
                    American Jews from New York and elsewhere in the U.S., although many were born
                    in Israel.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself caught between you might say this
                        ideological group which was essentially doing something which was against
                        our policy, but the spearhead of which was often American, I mean holding
                        dual passports. When things went wrong of one sort or another, did you have
                        to go in and sort of help Americans who were really Israelis? Did this cause
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Any American citizens who requested assistance from an American consulate
                    or embassy would always receive assistance, irrespective of their political
                    views. But militant settlers who were also Americans tended to avoid the
                    consulate. I don't know how many of the Americans who chose to live in Israel
                    retained their American passports. Some did, some did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that you would have had a problem
                        dealing with your staff Particularly your officers, I mean here in a way was
                        comparable to the situation in South Africa in dealing with what was
                        considered an oppressive government, the white government on the blacks.
                        Here from the perspective of a junior officer, they are focused on the
                        plight of the Palestinians. Yet it is very tricky. The older officers can
                        understand the dynamics of American politics, but young people tend to see
                        things in black and white. This is just; this isn't just. I would have
                        thought that this would be a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Any American diplomat who served in Jerusalem quickly became familiar
                    with the realities of the Palestinian problem. Those who had some previous
                    experience dealing with Israel knew the other side of the issue as well. My
                    officers were young, but while they were deeply involved and had strong views
                    about the situation, they were professionals, did not go off the deep end, and
                    maintained a necessary degree of detachment. I made it a point in myself and
                    encouraged my staff to report objectively and honestly about what was going on,
                    and we called our shots as we saw them. We worked hard to be honest and
                    objective, without glossing over the unpleasant realities of the Israeli
                    occupation and Palestinian failings as well. We saw ourselves as American
                    diplomats representing U.S. interests in the midst of a problem that required a
                    solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your reporting, yours and with your
                        officers. How was that received both in the embassy in Tel Aviv and in
                        Washington? Did you find you had to fine tune the reporting; how did you
                        deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I paid a great deal of attention to our reporting, and I wanted to make
                    sure that our reporting was not special pleading on behalf of the Palestinians,
                    while at the same time accurately conveying the situation and Palestinians
                    views. I also sought to put our reporting in the larger context of the
                    Palestinian-Israeli dispute. I thought I was in a good position to do that
                    having worked on the Israeli side of the street for some years. I was proud of
                    the reporting the consulate general did at that time. I though it was timely,
                    analytically rigorous, and directed to the Department's policy concerns. Our
                    reporting officers were in the field constantly. Some of them spoke Arabic and
                    Hebrew. We knew the political and business community in the West Bank and East
                    Jerusalem very well, and reported voluminously on what they were doing and what
                    they were saying.</p>
                <p>The response to the reporting was varied. Among colleagues in the department it
                    was appreciated. There were often positive comments, but there were also those
                    in my time and during the tours of all previous consuls general whose reporting
                    I previously read in Washington who thought the consulate's reporting was biased
                    toward the Palestinians. In any case, we believed our professional vocation was
                    to report objectively and honestly. I also thought my job description obliged me
                    to make policy recommendations from time to time and I did so. Those
                    recommendations were sometimes welcomed and sometimes not welcomed, but that is
                    to be expected. I tried to make recommendations with recognition of competing
                    factors, including, sometimes, Israeli equities that Washington policymakers
                    would have to balance and to give my best advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you comment on any of the recommendations that you

                <p>WILCOX: During the Intifada, a young Israeli reservist at a bus stop near Tel
                    Aviv killed a group of Palestinians and serious rioting broke out in Gaza.
                    Israeli forces responded in an excessive and heavy handed way, killing seventeen
                    Palestinians. Palestinian emotions, already running high in the midst of the
                    Intifada, grew even more intense. The local leadership was already involved in a
                    hunger strike against Israeli policies. The PLO introduced a resolution in thUN
                    Security Council condemning the use of excessive force by the Israeli forces. I
                    recommended that we engage in negotiations on this resolution rather than veto
                    it as we were increasingly doing. If we were unable to achieve balanced
                    language, we should abstain from the resolution. Our policy was to oppose the
                    use of excessive force against the Intifada in violation of recognized human
                    rights standards. We were also working to defuse the conflict and to encourage
                    the Palestinians to consider a political solution. I reasoned that a veto would
                    further reduce U.S. influence among the Palestinians and undermine our efforts
                    to get the Israelis to pursue a more sensible response to the Intifada. My
                    recommendation for an abstention was not welcomed in Washington and the U.S.
                    cast a veto in New York. The upshot was that the local Palestinian leadership in
                    the West Bank and Gaza decided to boycott further official contacts with the
                    U.S. officials, including the consulate. This was a foolish, counterproductive
                    move on their part, but it demonstrated their sense of anger, despair and
                    powerlessness.</p>
                <p>Some time later while on consultations in Washington, John Kelly, the Assistant
                    Secretary in NEA, who had earlier urged me to give my best advice to Washington,
                    told me, by way of cautioning me, that Robert Gates, the then Deputy National
                    Security Adviser in the White House, had said that “Wilcox has gone off the deep
                    end.” I surmised that my recommendation for an abstention in the Security
                    Council vote, which I thought I had presented in a thoughtful way, taking into
                    account my long experience in Washington dealing with U.S. votes in the UN, was
                    regarded as a radical proposal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds as though we were locked into almost the
                        same sort of diplomatic response that the Israelis and the Palestinians
                        were. At a certain point we wouldn't engage in any talk. It sounds like a
                        rather sad commentary on diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WILCOX: We were frustrated by the tendency of the Palestinians, with the help of
                    some of the Europeans, to go to the Security Council every time there was an
                    issue that should have been addressed through negotiations. We had been trying
                    for years to promote negotiations on the Palestinian issue, but were making
                    little headway with either the Palestinians or the Israelis. The Israelis would
                    not recognize the Palestinians, much less the PLO, as their negotiating partner,
                    the Palestinians expected the U.S. and the international community to do their
                    negotiations with Israel for them, and the U.S. at that time would not deal with
                    the PLO, whom all Palestinians regarded as the address for negotiations. The
                    tendency of the Arabs and the Palestinians to run to the Security Council every
                    time they had a serious grievance, combined with domestic pressures in the U.S.
                    to veto all UN resolutions critical of Israel, tended to increase alienation
                    between the U.S. and the Palestinians and their Arab friends.</p>
                <p>I always thought we should have used the Security Council more creatively, with
                    our influence and our leadership, to craft resolutions in the Security Council
                    which would go beyond sterile Israel bashing and help the situation. Instead,
                    the policy in Washington was that when it came to Security Council resolutions
                    on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we should not negotiate and that the
                    “worst” draft resolutions were the “best” because they were easier to veto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state, I am a little bit foggy on the
                        chronology, one the Intifada, the uprising. When did or was this to take
                        place? The other one was the beginning of talks with the Arab, the PLO in
                        Tunisia and all of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX:. The Intifada began in November, 1987, with riots in Gaza and in the West
                    Bank city of Nablus sparked by the deaths of Palestinian youths in
                    confrontations with the IDF. It spread spontaneously, with strikes, marches,
                    barricades, and stonings of Israeli forces.</p>
                <p>In a matter of months a full scale mass protest movement emerged, led by a
                    clandestine Intifada leadership dominated by the PLO Fatah faction. Protesters
                    had no firearms, but used stones against the IDF. The leadership also issued
                    regular leaflets which contained propaganda and calls for strikes, boycotts
                    against Israeli products, and the withholding of Palestinian day laborers from
                    work in Israeli factories and homes and fields. The leaflets contained a lot of
                    rhetoric, as well as the core of the Intifada's ideology and tactical advice to
                    the Palestinians. We read these documents with great care and reported them.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The Israelis were caught by surprise, since the Palestinians had been relatively
                    passive since 1967, and had never before mounted a sustained protest movement.
                    The IDF was forced to deploy many more Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza
                    than they ever had in the past. Its strategy was to respond with major force,
                    for fear of being seen as weak, instead of ignoring the riots and letting them
                    play out, which would have been a sounder strategy. So thousands of young
                    Israeli conscripts and older reservists found themselves involved in street
                    battles with stone-throwing Palestinian kids. The IDF saw themselves as a
                    fighting army and they were cast in this new role as policemen to put down
                    street riots. They were unprepared. Although the policy was to use live fire
                    only in self defense, the death toll from live fire grew. Many Palestinians were
                    also killed or wounded by rubber, steel-cored, bullets that were widely used.
                    The IDF also used beatings, curfews, massive arrests, and the confinement of
                    people in whole villages or areas, a form of collective punishment.</p>
                <p>Rather than subduing the Intifada, these Israeli practices intensified it, and
                    the IDF was put, increasingly, on the defensive. The uprising had a profound
                    effect on Israeli public opinion which in the past has assumed that the
                    occupation could be maintained without much effort and that the Palestinians had
                    been subdued. Now they were sending their sons and husbands to subdue
                    Palestinian teenagers and they found this troubling. The troops themselves
                    disliked the new role they had been cast in, and a process of soul searching
                    about the occupation began.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the Palestinians began to sharpen their propaganda and to
                    articulate more carefully their cause to sympathetic Israeli journalists and to
                    the western media. The western press reported on the Intifada intensively and
                    the specter of heavily armed Israeli armed forces beating up unarmed Palestinian
                    youths created a lot of sympathy in the United States and Western Europe for the
                    Palestinians. [As a result of] this renewed interest and attention to the
                    Palestinian cause, many for the first time saw the human dimension of the
                    occupation and all its anomalies. In Israel, people began to ask how the
                    occupation could be sustained - and the peace movement and political ferment
                    grew.</p>
                <p>Some Israelis advocated harsher crackdowns on the Palestinians, but many others
                    said this [was] an untenable [price] for a liberal democracy to pay in terms of
                    repression and violation of human rights and began to advocate a political
                    solution. The Palestinians, themselves gained a new sense of pride. [They]
                    gained new respect and increased understanding in the world, where they had
                    often projected a negative image. This external recognition, plus the fact that
                    the Palestinians had for the first time stood up to the Israelis, gave the
                    Palestinians a new sense of confidence and, in return, realism and honesty about
                    their situation with the Israelis. The fact that the Palestinians in the West
                    Bank and Gaza took the initiative in the Intifada themselves, without prompting
                    or direction from the external PLO, added to their sense of confidence. As a
                    result, Palestinians began to talk among themselves and to us about recognizing
                    Israel and a negotiated peace which would result in the creation of a
                    Palestinian state which would live peacefully with Israel. Such talk was almost
                    never heard in the '70s or the '80s when I had first met Palestinians. We
                    engaged with Palestinians and encouraged them.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>There had been signs over the years of pragmatism and moderation within the PLO,
                    but the mold of rejectionism had not been broken, in part, I think, because the
                    U.S. did not engage with the PLO. A major change in Palestinian doctrine came at
                    the Algiers meeting of the Palestinian National Congress in 1988 when an aide of
                    Arafat's, Bassam Abu Sharif, published a paper, with official blessing, that
                    called for the creation of two states, the recognition of Israel, and peace
                    between them. At first, Washington was skeptical and paid little attention, but
                    this was a seminal document that reflected an important shift in Palestinian
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>The Intifada was the impetus for this change. The Palestinians in West Bank and
                    Gaza, for the first time, began to assert themselves with the external PLO. They
                    were in constant touch with Arafat and the PLO leadership and were urging them
                    to be more creative and to seek a political solution with the Israelis. Arafat
                    and his leadership reacted positively, recognizing that they had to be
                    responsive to their constituents in the occupied territories who had initiated
                    and were bearing the brunt of the Intifada. A new synthesis emerged in the PLO
                    that led to its commitment to forswear terrorism and recognize resolution 242
                    and to the beginnings of a U.S.-PLO dialogue in Tunis. That dialogue was
                    suspended when the gang of Abu Abas, a radical member of the PLO executive
                    committee, staged an abortive attack against Israel on the beach at Herzliyya,
                    near Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>To summarize, the Intifada created real political movement on both the Israeli
                    and Palestinian side in the direction of accommodation. It was an important
                    event in the history of the conflict and the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role during this time, when the Intifada had
                        reached full proportions. Could you talk about how we were seeing it there?
                        Was there a different perspective from our embassy in Tel Aviv and also with
                        Israeli officials, sort of how did you fit into this and what were you
                        reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The embassy in Tel Aviv received the full weight of Israeli views and
                    reported them. I think the embassy in Tel Aviv also understood that the Intifada
                    was a serious crisis and that it created a new situation which [called] for
                    renewed diplomatic efforts. Tel Aviv was also responsible for covering Gaza, so
                    it had a window into Palestinian affairs. Naturally, since most of the embassy's
                    interlocutors were Israelis, they tended to pay more attention to Israeli
                    urgings and demarches, but I do not think the embassy's reporting was biased or
                    unbalanced. I made a point of visiting the embassy almost weekly and consulting
                    with our ambassador. The ambassador was Tom Pickering when I arrived, and Bill
                    Brown during the latter part of my tour there. I felt it was very important for
                    the embassy and the consulate general to avoid an adversary relationship and
                    become the advocates of their respective clients. I urged my staff and embassy
                    likewise to get our two staffs together so that we could talk about a common
                    U.S. approach to these things. There was not always agreement, but there was
                    regular contact by phone and in person, and I felt it was critical to maintain
                    this. There had been times in the past where there was severe tension between
                    the consulate general and the embassy. In some respects it was kind of built in
                    to this situation. I was aware of this and worked hard to avoid it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the great focus of the press, TV news, CNN with
                        particularly cable news. I mean you can always lead with a story showing
                        Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli troops and groups of Israeli
                        troops firing back. I mean here you were, this was your area of
                        responsibility. Did you find it difficult dealing with the press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I dealt with them regularly as I always had in Washington. I tried to
                    give them the most objective appraisal I could to expound U.S. policy. The press
                    did a particularly good job of reporting on the Intifada. The U.S. press helped
                    illuminate the issues to the American public, as did the Israeli media for the
                    Israelis. Media reporting helped create the political catharsis on both the
                    Israeli and Palestinian sides that was quite encouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you and your staff do during this time to sort of
                        get out the word. You know, this is an opportunity. Whom were you talking to
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There wasn't an elected or formally recognized leadership structure in
                    the West Bank. The old municipal leadership had been undermined by Israeli
                    deportation, and the Israelis discouraged the emergence of other leaders by
                    arrests and deportations. This lack of a coherent recognized political structure
                    on the inside made it difficult to find the points of authority and key
                    interlocutors.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>The Intifada leadership were young people who were unidentified and carefully
                    concealed. There was an overt tier of respected pro-PLO Palestinians, however,
                    including journalists, lawyers, doctors, businessmen, notables, and political
                    figures like Faisal Husseini who were influential and served as a kind of local
                    leadership. We saw these people regularly. They and the younger clandestine
                    Intifada leadership were all trying to persuade the PLO to move further toward
                    compromise.</p>
                <p>There was chronic rivalry amonPalestinians, as there had been historically, that
                    threatened their unity and sense of purpose. This rivalry, based on regional and
                    clan ties, weakened the cohesiveness of the community and its ability to deal
                    with their situation. Arafat and the external PLO encouraged this rivalry, since
                    they did not want strong political leaders to emerge in the occupied
                    territories. Disunity was a constant problem when we had American visitors
                    either from the Congress or the executive branch who wanted to talk to
                    Palestinians. Our job was to invite Palestinians who have some stature and who
                    might in some way be representative to meet with Americans. But because of
                    rivalries, it was not always easy to get a group of Palestinians who would come
                    to meet with senior Americans. Often they were interested in who else was
                    coming. That was part of our burden in the consulate general, but we generally
                    succeeded. We had to work very hard with the Palestinians to identify a team of
                    Palestinians to meet with Secretary Baker when he began his round of
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Most Palestinians viewed the U.S. as partisan and pro-Israel, and this
                    complicated our relations with them, but most realized the value of contacts
                    with the consulate, and during my first year in Jerusalem we had superb access.
                    However, after the U.S. veto of the Security Council resolution following the
                    killing of the Palestinians at Rishon Lezion and in Gaza in the midst of the
                    Intifada, the most prominent Palestinians decided to boycott all further
                    contacts with Americans. This interrupted some of our contacts, but we stayed in
                    touch with many others and with intermediaries of the boycott group.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time of great tension and confrontation, I
                        would have thought you would have been quite concerned about Americans who
                        were settlers there. Just by the filtering process as you say, these tended
                        to be the most zealous of the group who have come over and made this choice.
                        Were you kind of keeping an eye out of saying You know I am a little worried
                        about this guy or group or something. They might start shooting, because
                        they were armed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: One of my colleagues, Bob Silverman, who spent a good deal of time
                    following the settler movement, once approached a settlement and was accosted at
                    gun point by a settler and forced to leave. At my request the embassy protested
                    this to the government of Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with the Israeli officials in
                        Jerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The only relationship we had with Israeli officials was with the
                    municipality of Jerusalem. That tradition was established many years ago, so I
                    would regularly deal with Mayor Teddy Kollek and his deputies. We had
                    housekeeping, security, and logistic problems, so we needed to have contact with
                    the municipality. Those relations were usually cordial and direct.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we did not have formal relationships with the foreign ministry
                    and the foreign ministry instructed it personnel not to deal with consulate
                    officers. Nonetheless, having worked earlier in Israeli affairs, I had friends
                    in the government of Israel and occasionally they would come to my residence,
                    but they did so after hours. There was no formal relationship. Israeli doctrine
                    of the indivisibility of Jerusalem and permanent Israeli control of Jerusalem
                    was vigorously asserted, and the Israelis resented the fact that the Americans
                    had an independent diplomatic mission in Jerusalem that reported directly to
                    Washington, while we maintained our embassy in Tel Aviv. There was always
                    tension there, but it has existed for many years. By and large, Israeli
                    diplomats were professionals, very sophisticated people. They generally handled
                    this in a civilized way.There was one major exception. Several members of my
                    staff who lived in West Jerusalem reported over a period of months that their
                    apartments had been broken into and items were moved in a way designed to show
                    that someone had been there surreptitiously. Nothing was stolen. When I was
                    convinced that there was a pattern to this, I called on the Director of Protocol
                    at the Foreign Ministry to alert him to this problem. I strongly suspected that
                    Israeli security personnel had entered the apartments as a form of harassment or
                    game playing. I wanted to let the Foreign Ministry know of my concern [by]
                    alleging official involvement. Thereafter, there were no further entries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Jerusalem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In 1988 in April.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure whether you missed it but it is almost a rite
                        of passage that in any election year around the time of spring is when the
                        primaries come. That's when every candidate for anything goes to New York
                        and promises that they are going to see that our embassy is moved to
                        Jerusalem. That hasn't happened, I mean it comes up all the time. It may
                        happen some time. Did that come up in your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It came up constantly. We kept our embassy in Tel Aviv in 1948 after the
                    [Israeli] government moved to Jerusalem, and maintained the independent status
                    of the consulate general in Jerusalem to demonstrate that the status of
                    Jerusalem had to be resolved in negotiations, not unilateral acts. When Israel
                    occupied East Jerusalem in 1967, we regarded that part of the city as occupied
                    territory.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Today, the Palestinians demand the recovery of East Jerusalem and the
                    establishment of the capital of the Palestinian state there. They no longer seek
                    recover West Jerusalem where many tens of thousands of Palestinians lived before
                    1948 and were forced out of their homes to East Jerusalem or the West Bank or
                    elsewhere.There was a wall between the East and West sides of the city between
                    1948 and 1967, and Jews were denied access to their holy sites. Some Israelis
                    fear that if the Palestinians are given East Jerusalem they will re-divide the
                    city. The Palestinians, [however], say they want and need an open city in which
                    the two communities can deal with each other. Jerusalem has enormous emotional
                    significance for both Israelis and Palestinians, and it is wrong to assert that
                    one side or another has a superior claim to Jerusalem or that one or another has
                    more historical significance. The fact is that it is of supreme political and
                    religious importance for both Palestinians and Israelis will ultimately require
                    a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem and perhaps some novel arrangements for
                    shared sovereignty in certain areas. This can be done, although it is
                    increasingly difficult because of the construction of huge Israeli settlements
                    in large areas of East Jerusalem on confiscated Arab land.</p>
                <p>Because a solution of the Jerusalem issue is critical to a comprehensive
                    Palestinian-Israeli peace settlement, the U.S. must continue to insist that the
                    final status of East Jerusalem must be settled by mutual agreement. If we move
                    our embassy to Jerusalem before that happens, we will undermine or role as
                    intermediary and therefore risk prolonging conflict, with resultant damage to
                    our interests in the Middle East and a stable peace for both Israelis and
                    Palestinians.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Gulf War between Iraq and the United States
                        and other powers impact on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Staying with Jerusalem, for a minute, there has been a lot of rhetoric
                    about the unity of Jerusalem. But it is, in fact, a deeply divided city in which
                    30-40% of the population are Arabs who oppose Israeli rule. The city is divided
                    politically, socially, and psychologically, and there is chronic tension. The
                    Jewish-Arab geographical division is far less distinct now because of the
                    settlers in East Jerusalem. The current arrangement is unsatisfactory in every
                    way. I have always believed that a political division of the two peoples in the
                    city will bring about a closer social, economic and cultural relations between
                    them and create a much happier city. The city would remain open, in any case,
                    since the Arabs want an open city as much as the Israelis do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you are talking about Jerusalem, did you and your
                        staff have any problem with the tensions there during the time you were
                        there or with the extreme orthodox element?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The ultra orthodox ignored us, but the settlers disliked us because the
                    U.S. opposed settlements and advocated a territorial compromise with the Arabs.
                    However, we watched security very carefully. I think Washington often
                    exaggerated the threat to American citizens in Jerusalem through the frequent
                    issuance of travel advisories, especially during the Intifada. At one time there
                    was pressure to actually move my staff who lived in East Jerusalem into West
                    Jerusalem. I successfully resisted this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be a political move, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It would have had profound political significance and would have crippled
                    our mission. The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, was quite unhappy with our
                    security advisories on Jerusalem, and he once called me in and told me that
                    there had been 11 homicides in Jerusalem in I think it was 1989 whereas, there
                    had been X-hundred homicides in the city of Washington that year. He said we
                    should pay more attention to security in our own country and avoid our alarmist
                    security advisories about Jerusalem because it hurt tourism, which was and is
                    hugely important to Jerusalem's economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then let's go to the Gulf War. Could you explain
                        one, what the Gulf War was, and then talk about its impact on your
                        operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: In 1990 and 91, President Bush, mobilized a brilliantly successful
                    coalition of western states who deployed multinational forces led mainly by the
                    U.S. ultimately to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. That required vigorous
                    diplomacy with our allies in the UN Security Council. The coalition victory
                    against Saddam Hussein and was a great victory for the United States and the
                    west. The Gulf War drew in Israel because Saddam began to launch SCUD missiles
                    against Israel. The United States, fearing that Israeli retaliation against Iraq
                    would undermine the U.S. Arab cooperation against Saddam, urged that the
                    Israelis forebear from retaliating against Iraq. Deputy Secretary Eagleburger
                    visited Israel in an effort to persuade them not to, and succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the Israelis did not respond to these
                        attacks in part because of the Americans and in part because...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The Israelis decided not to respond to the Iraqi attacks in part, because
                    of our urging, but also in part because of the lack of militarily effective
                    means of retaliating. The SCUDs were being launched from the deserts of Iraq.
                    They were very difficult to pinpoint. Aerial attacks from Israel against Iraqi
                    sites would require over flights of Jordan or Syria which those countries
                    certainly would not have permitted, and therefore would have meant a violation
                    of the airspace. The Israelis probably recognized they couldn't find these
                    sites, some of which were mobile, and that bombing them wouldn't be an effective
                    response. They probably also recognized that they did not have the capability of
                    sending ground forces to Iraq to destroy these missile sites, even if they could
                    locate them. Another over flight route would have been over Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>So, they did not retaliate, departing from the normal tradition of hitting back
                    hard. The Israeli public hunkered down and withstood the missile attacks.
                    Miraculously, they killed no one, but did considerable damage in Tel Aviv in
                    certain neighborhoods. The Iraqi SCUDs were primitive and poorly guided. To help
                    Israel, the U.S. deployed batteries of Patriot anti-missile missiles in Tel
                    Aviv. There was a controversy about how effective these missiles actually were,
                    but it was a political gesture by the United States which helped reinforce the
                    Israeli policy of not retaliating against Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your staff in this? What changes in your work
                        was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was real concern about the safety of Americans, and a good many
                    Americans from Tel Aviv were evacuated with their wives. A number of my own
                    staff were evacuated also including spouses. My wife Cynda also left,
                    reluctantly. No missiles were launched against Jerusalem. I predicted this,
                    because Jerusalem was also an Arab city, and the site of many Islamic holy
                    places. But, there was real concern. These missiles were also quite inaccurate.
                    We could see their trails passing overhead in the night. You could never tell
                    where they were going to land, so there was much anxiety.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Some Israelis left the country. Tourism virtually stopped. But for the
                    most part the Israelis hunkered down. There was a massive, well organized civil
                    defense effort. There was great concern about chemical warheads on these
                    missiles, and Israelis were issued gas masks and vinyl sheeting to seal up their
                    houses and Atabrine, a medical antidote, were available. The Israelis did an
                    excellent job in reacting to this. There was no panic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about within the West Bank community? One, reaction to
                        Iraq's war and two, how they reacted to the missile threat and what the
                        Israelis were doing to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Before the war started, Palestinian intellectuals were for the most part
                    contemptuous of Saddam Hussein. They saw him as an Arab tyrant, not a leader
                    they wanted to emulate. But when the war began and the missile attacks started,
                    there was a spontaneous support among many Palestinians for Saddam. There was
                    shock and chagrin of course, on the part of the Israelis and West that the
                    Palestinians could support Saddam. But this behavior was quite understandable,
                    if regrettable, given the Palestinians enmity for their Israeli occupiers and
                    their apparent helplessness to do anything about it. Arafat, you will recall,
                    actually went to Baghdad and was photographed embracing Saddam., a step he later
                    regretted when Saddam lost the war. The Palestinians support for Iraq alienated
                    them, for awhile, from the U.S. A more important consequence was the expulsion
                    of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Kuwait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have either a problem or a situation to deal with
                        let's say before the missile attacks, because there was a period of a few
                        months almost six months I suppose. The Iraqis went into Kuwait in August of
                        1990, and we really didn't start attacking until January guess, of 1991. The
                        United States was sort of shocked to see particularly these Jordanians
                        jumping around with joy about what Saddam had done to Kuwait. Did you have
                        the same thing in Jerusalem and the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Palestinian support for Saddam was influenced, I think, by the inferior
                    status that the Palestinians had been given in Kuwait where there were thousands
                    and thousands of Palestinians, professionals, working people, businessmen. Very
                    few had been given Kuwaiti citizenship, although they made important
                    contributions to Kuwait. As for Jordan, King Hussein's support for Saddam also
                    infuriated Washington, but given Jordan's critical economic relationship with
                    Iraq and support among the masses for Saddam, the King had less room for
                    maneuver that the U.S. realized.</p>
                <p>

                        Saddam Hussein is our enemy, and you are not helping yourselves. I am
                        talking during this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Of course that was our message. We said it was crazy for the Palestinians
                    to support Saddam Hussein when it was in the interest of the Palestinians to
                    make common cause with the United States which was better positioned than anyone
                    else to try to help the Palestinians make peace with the Israelis and do justice
                    to the Palestinians. It was a disaster for the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your take when you went out into Jerusalem on
                        Arafat and his leadership, and did this change over the time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Arafat and his PLO leadership were in part responsible for the stalemate
                    and lack of movement toward a negotiated settlement between Israelis and
                    Palestinians. Arafat as I said earlier, his leaders clung for years to the
                    notion that Israel was not a legitimate entity, that it should not be
                    recognized, and the policy should be steadfast confrontation. There were people
                    in the Palestinian national movement and the Palestinian diaspora who saw
                    clearly some years ago before the Intifada that this was a hopeless position.
                    Israel was a strong powerful state. It was there to stay and had powerful
                    friends, and if the Palestinians wanted to salvage something from the disaster
                    that had befallen them, they would have to treat with Israel for peace and try
                    to divide the land. This view did not prevail in the PLO until 1988. The
                    moderate voices were overruled and some of the moderates were even assassinated
                    by PLO extremist groups, such as Abu Nidal's gang. Arafat's first goal was to
                    preserve a tenuous unity among the PLO factions and to stay on top. He had
                    devoted his career to keeping this diverse group of Palestinian exile
                    organizations. They ranged from the moderately peaceful to the most violent and
                    fanatic. Arafat did this quite successfully over the years.</p>
                <p>If Arafat had been a leader of broader vision, he might have faced down the
                    radical factions of the PLO much earlier and pursued a more pragmatic policy
                    toward peace with Israel. If he had done so, he might have found a willing
                    partner in Israel, but he also might not have. Israel is also to be blamed for
                    rejectionism, since for years, there was no interest in Israel in dealing with
                    the PLO, which was regarded as a terrorist organization, and the great majority
                    of the Israelis were in denial about Palestinian nationalism and the need for a
                    Palestinian state and a withdrawal from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
                    So was the United States, which had forsworn any political contacts with the PLO
                    or Arafat. Like Israel, the U.S. failed to understand the reality and depth of
                    Palestinian nationalism and the centrality of the PLO, and continued to pursue
                    the chimera of a Jordanian solution to the Palestinian issue. So, the radicals,
                    the hard liners prevailed for decades among the Palestinians and the Israelis
                    until the Intifada and the Gulf War precipitated changes that led to the Madrid
                    conference and the Oslo Declaration of Principles.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Jordan have any, did you see the hand of Jordan any
                        time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, Jordan itself has a fascinating history of pragmatic relations with
                    the early Zionists and the state of Israel going all the way back to King
                    Abdullah. He was the only Arab leader during the 1930s and '40s who recognized
                    that Zionism and Israel had to be dealt with. Abdullah was also fierce opponent
                    of the Palestinian national movement and saw the Palestinians and the Hashemites
                    as competitors for Palestine, and for this reason he saw that he had a common
                    interest with the Zionists.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>In 1948 Jordan assumed that it would remain the sovereign power in the West Bank
                    and Abdullah let the new Israeli government know that he was interested in
                    peace. King Hussein inherited his grandfather's interest in coexistence with
                    Israel, and viewed Palestinian nationalism as a threat to the Hashemite Kingdom.
                    He unwisely bowed to Egyptian and Arab pressure and allowed Jordan to be dragged
                    into the 1967 war, and lost the West Bank to Israel. Jordanian-Palestinian
                    enmity grew worse when in 1970, the PLO, in the Black September movement,
                    challenged Jordan militarily, and lost. Over the next two decades, Hussein
                    gradually began to recognize that it was not in Jordan's strategic interest to
                    recover the West Bank. This would have meant the absorption of two million
                    Palestinians into Jordan which already was composed of a populace that was at
                    least half Palestinian. To have absorbed this additional burden of Palestinians
                    would have threatened the future of the Hashemite dynasty. So, in 1987 as the
                    Intifada was taking root, King Hussein made an historic announcement that he no
                    longer aspired to recover the West Bank, and that the Palestinians were on their
                    own. This reflected his vision as a statesman and a politician.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although he renounced it, we didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Right. We were still behind the Jordanians. Now we were not committed in
                    any articulate way to the Jordan option, but it was implicitly what we wanted.
                    It was also the arrangement the Israeli Labor party wanted. By the mid-1980s the
                    Labor Party was willing to cede part of the West Bank to Jordan, because it
                    recognized that the status quo was not tenable. They trusted Hussein, and saw
                    the solution in a Jordanian-Palestinian arrangement, with Jordan as the senior
                    partner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a let down, a disappointment. Iraq collapsed
                        rather quickly. I mean there was supposed to be this great battle, and it
                        turned out that the Iraqis didn't stand up to the allied forces at all,
                        although Saddam Hussein maintained it so. I would have thought that you
                        would on the part of the people in East Jerusalem and the West bank had
                        invested quite a lot of emotional capital in this. Did you see a let
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was deep despair. There had been this euphoria, an unrealistic view
                    that somehow the Arab world, the Islamic world would rally to Saddam Hussein.
                    The U.S. victory created a sense of disappointment, and political defeat. By
                    that time the Intifada, which had caused great suffering, was faltering, and it
                    was clear that the Israelis would not yield to the Palestinians. Israeli
                    repression, economic restrictions, various forms of collective punishment had
                    been effective in blunting the Intifada. Internecine rivalries among the
                    Palestinians also played a part. And radical Palestinian groups began killing
                    other Palestinians for political reasons, and to settle scores. It was an ugly
                    business. The early sense of hope and euphoria had fadeSo, at the end of the
                    Gulf War, whereas the Intifada had inspired a sense of sort of hope and
                    confidence earlier, this spirit was replaced by disillusionment.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>It was at this time that Bush administration recognized the opportunity which the
                    victory of the U.S. in the Gulf and the fall of the Soviet Union offered for a
                    resurrection of the peace process. Bush and Baker seized the moment, using the
                    greatly enhanced power of the U.S. and the favorable new geo-political situation
                    to launch a new peace initiative, and they did so in a very determined way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Jerusalem to get a feel for the
                        timing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I left Jerusalem in September of 1991, after Secretary Baker had visited
                    there five times for negotiations with local Palestinians and with the Shamir
                    government, a process that ultimately led to the Madrid conference, the
                    beginning of the renewed peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Secretary Baker's engagement,
                        and this was really his first time. I mean we had the collapse of the Soviet
                        Union which was enough on anyone's plate, and in a way he was sort of
                        dragged in to this thing by the Gulf War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The collapse of the Soviet Union was as you say a factor in emerging
                    American supremacy, and it greatly enhanced our diplomatic leverage in dealing
                    with the Middle East where the Soviets were no longer a factor on behalf of the
                    radical Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about your impression of Secretary Baker,
                        particularly from what you saw because oral history is trying to focus on
                        the view, and also members of his team, Dennis Ross and others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Baker was a tough, skilled negotiator who understood that here was an
                    opportunity for American leadership and for another effort to resolve this
                    chronic, decades-old problem. The convergence of forces which I have mentioned
                    brought about a genuine, full blown negotiating effort. Baker and Bush deserve
                    great credit for taking this initiative. As Baker became more involved, he got
                    the bit in his mouth and began to push both sides hard. He ultimately succeeded
                    in bringing the parties together at an international conference, one of his
                    finest achievements as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, in Jerusalem when he came, he would meet with Palestinians at my
                    residence. He was tough, persistent negotiator, human, and frank. The
                    Palestinians respected him; I think he respected them too. He understood that
                    they had something to say, and I think, had some sympathy for their position. Of
                    course, I was never with him when he was with the Israelis, but he had the same
                    style with the Israelis. Shamir resisted Baker, all the way, but Baker
                    prevailed, and dragged Shamir against his will to the Madrid Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, this was a real historic thing in that the
                        secretary of state was treating the Palestinians as real people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The U.S. had never had high level contact with the Palestinians in the
                    past, above the level of the consulate general, at least until the dialogue
                    began in Tunis in 1988, but that was quite limited in content. George Shultz
                    made a gesture to the Palestinians in 1987, I think it was that year, when he
                    offered to meet with a group of Palestinians at the American Colony Hotel in
                    East Jerusalem. They foolishly boycotted him and no one came. So Baker's
                    contacts were really the first at the level of Secretary of State. Shultz met
                    once in Washington with Edward Said and Abraham Abu Loughud, but they were
                    Palestinian-American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a responsibility to get the right
                        Palestinians there to talk. You talk about these factions and going through
                        a period of depression, I would have thought it would be difficult to get
                        the right group together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Very difficult. There was jealously and no recognizable center in the
                    Palestinian community. I think that's the way Arafat wanted it, and the Israelis
                    had also done their share to prevent the emergence of a strong local leadership,
                    for example, by arresting and often deporting nationalist political leaders, and
                    undermining local government by appointing puppet mayors. One of the most able
                    and respected Palestinians, Faisal Husseini, had been repeatedly jailed by the
                    Israelis for his nationalist views, as had others.</p>
                <p>The idea of meeting with Baker was controversial because the Palestinians had a
                    sense of grievance against the U.S., which they saw as pro-Israel. Indeed, at
                    the time the Bush-Baker initiative was conceived, the Palestinians were still
                    boycotting official contacts with all American officials, including the
                    consulate. Also, they had no local representative institutions for choosing
                    leaders to negotiate for them, and none of the local leaders where ever sure
                    where they stood vis a vis the PLO. The meetings that ultimately happened
                    required Arafat's approval, so there was a lot of to and froing with Tunis, by
                    fax and phone, which the Israelis doubtless monitored. So, it was touch and go,
                    and I was never certain whether the first of these meetings would come off.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>My principal interlocutor with the Palestinians had been Faisal Husseini, the son
                    of Abdul Khader Husseini, the famous Palestinian military leader, was killed in
                    the battle at Kastel near Jerusalem in the 1948 war. Faisal Husseini was an
                    educated man, committed to the Palestinian cause, from the dominant Palestinian
                    clan that had produced the leader of the nationalist movement in the late
                    thirties and early forties, Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>I called on Faisal Husseini soon after my arrival in Jerusalem after he had been
                    released from prison and established a relationship with him. He had had no
                    contacts with the consulate for many years, and was still considered a dangerous
                    radical by the Israelis. I found him a thoughtful man who had studied the
                    Palestinian-Israeli conflict very deeply and was beginning to evolve a new and
                    realistic view of the need for peace and compromise. Notwithstanding his long
                    imprisonment, he took a statesmanlike view of things and avoided the
                    anti-Israeli hatred and the doctrinaire bombast one often heard from
                    Palestinians. While in prison, he had learned Hebrew, and he was developing
                    close contacts with Israeli liberals and the Peace Now movement.</p>
                <p>Husseini had a lot of stature in the Palestinian community, in part because he
                    was smart, steady, and incorruptible, and in part because he was the son of
                    Abdul Quader and the grand nephew of the Mufti. But his aristocratic family
                    lineage was also an obstacle, especially among young radical Palestinians who
                    believed that the time of the old families and “notables” had come and gone,
                    since they had failed to rescue the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>When Assistant Secretary John Kelly called me from Washington and announced that
                    Baker wanted to meet with a representative group of Palestinians, I began
                    working to assemble a delegation, putting the word out by phone or in meetings
                    with intermediaries with whom we had kept in touch despite the boycott.</p>
                <p>One evening late at night, Faisal Husseini called me at my residence and said it
                    is time to - I think he used the phrase - “turn a new page,” that the
                    Palestinian-U.S. impasse should give way to dialogue, and that the Palestinians
                    recognized Baker's initiative as an opportunity and would agree to meet with
                    him. This showed courage and leadership on his part, and indicated he had
                    overcome the rejectionists who wanted no contact with the U.S. It also indicated
                    that he had been given the green light from the PLO in Tunis. So working with
                    him, we gradually assembled the right group of Palestinians, and the first
                    meeting took place with Jim Baker. He made five trips while I was in Jerusalem,
                    and there were further meetings when Molly Williamson took over as my successor.
                    Through his meetings with the Palestinians and separate meetings with the
                    Israelis, Baker put together agreed terms of reference for the Madrid peace
                    conference, a major diplomatic breakthrough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of Dennis Ross at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Dennis Ross had become Secretary Baker's principal aide and advisor on
                    the peace process. Others on the team were Dan Kurtzer, who later became Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. Dan is now Ambassador to Egypt. John Kelly, the Assistant
                    Secretary of State, and David Welch who at that time was working on the NSC
                    staff with Dennis Ross.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself having sort of post mortems after
                        these meetings with the Palestinians. You know they would come to you and
                        say what was that all about? I mean it is a normal thing, figure out what we
                        would talk about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. I tried to set the stage for further meetings and to refine the
                    issues and to urge them to focus more clearly and to sharpen up their
                    understanding of what we were looking for. We didn't start immediately with the
                    concept of an international conference in Madrid. That emerged. Baker's approach
                    was “Here is an opportunity for peace. It is good for you and good for your
                    neighbors and good for us. Let's be realistic and pragmatic, and see what we can
                    put together.” This big sticking point, of course, was that the Israelis would
                    not talk to the PLO, who by then Washington had finally realized represented the
                    Palestinians. Also the Israelis feared an international conference, fearing a
                    gang up. Ultimately Baker sold the Israelis a formula for an opening conference,
                    to be followed by bilateral negotiations.</p>
                <p>As Baker's meetings with the Palestinians developed, it was implicit that the
                    Palestinians were not speaking for themselves, but the PLO. Baker understood
                    this, but persuaded the Palestinians to go along with the fiction that the PLO
                    was not involved, so that the Israelis could be brought on board. In the end,
                    all sides agreed to a formula that Baker finally sold, though the Palestinians
                    didn't like it, that the Palestinians would not have their own delegation at
                    Madrid, but would be joined with the Jordanians. At Madrid, the facade of
                    Jordanian primacy was quickly broken and it became clear to the world that the
                    Palestinians were speaking for Palestinians, not Jordan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that you were helping to create
                        Palestinian or at least a West Bank Jerusalem leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We didn't create it, but we encouraged it to think realistically and to
                    engage with the United States and ultimately with Israel. I think that was
                    really the main mission and accomplishment of the consulate general at that
                    time, to cultivate, encourage the local leadership to move in the right
                    direction. This took a lot of sympathy, encouragement and diplomacy. We wanted
                    the Palestinians to know we respected them and that we saw them as a people with
                    equities and a cause that deserved our respect and attention. They needed this,
                    because they felt, justifiably, that their cause had been neglected and
                    misunderstood, and there was a lot of resentment.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The Palestinians on their part did not understand the United States. They had
                    limited grasp of the West and they did not know how to project their cause or
                    articulate it. They had done a lousy job of this over the years, in part because
                    they lacked knowledge of the U.S., and in part because their cause was so clear
                    to them that they assumed everyone else should understand and accept it. Also, I
                    think those elements who used terrorism as a political weapon gravely undermined
                    their cause. For many in the U.S., the Palestinian movement was identified with
                    terrorism rather than the legitimate claims of a people who also deserved our
                    support and respect just as the Israelis did. And terrorism played into the
                    hands of the Israeli hard right who preached that the Palestinians were
                    determined to destroy Israel and that efforts to compromise with them were na�ve
                    and dangerous. This view was often promoted, of course, by the Likud and other
                    right wing elements who wanted no compromise and for whom hanging on to the
                    occupied territories was more important than peace. Demonizing the Palestinians
                    provided a rationale for their expansionist ideology.So giving the Palestinians
                    a sense that they were important and we respected them and they had equities and
                    rights was very important. Baker's willingness to engage with them helped a lot.
                    Of course, that was our job at the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any growth in a political movement in the
                        United States? You know there is a Jewish Israeli one; there is the Greek
                        one, Irish one, and there are a considerable number of Arabs in the United
                        States from various places in the Arab world, and yet they never seemed to
                        be very cohesive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It hasn't been very cohesive because it is a very diverse community. The
                    Arab world is vast and varied, and this is reflected in the ethnic, religious,
                    national origin differences among members of the Arab-American community. The
                    Arab American community has sought assimilation as its first goal and has not
                    coalesced into a strong and influential lobbying group. So it hasn't been a
                    major force in articulating the Palestinian point of view in the Congress or the
                    executive branch.</p>
                <p>Now they certainly have improved their performance. The National Association of
                    Arab Americans and the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee has an
                    articulate, thoughtful leadership now. They support the peace process and an
                    equitable solution with Israel. There are similarly many American Jewish
                    organizations that have been pro-peace and also backed the Madrid and Oslo
                    processes. Many American Jews were relieved and pleased with this turn of events
                    and strongly supported it during the Peres-Rabin era. When the Likud returned to
                    power, official American Jewish opinion became somewhat more conservative. The
                    voices of the moderate and liberal voices within the American Jewish community
                    were not as prominent as they were during the days of Labor governments, and
                    AIPAC has become more right wing.</p>

                        stop at this point and put at the end where you went. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I came back to Washington to become the senior Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), where I served for three years
                    before my final three years in the Foreign Service as Coordinator for
                    Counterterrorism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right then we will pick up maybe one or both of those
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is July 13, 1998. Phil, you are off to INR. What were you doing in INR?
                    This was what, '91-'94 about?</p>
                <p>WILCOX: '91-'94. I was the principal deputy assistant secretary. Actually, I
                    served for the first year as acting assistant secretary because the new
                    assistant secretary, Toby Gati, who was a political appointee who had been the
                    head of the UN Association in New York, was appointed sometime after I arrived,
                    and the confirmation process took a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing it what would you say was the role of
                        INR during this time. The role of INR changes around. What did you feel were
                        your major functions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think INR's model and ideal for itself is to be the premier analytic
                    element in the intelligence community. INR is State's branch of the intelligence
                    community, and its role is not to collect information, raw intelligence but to
                    draw information from all sources, secret intelligence, open source information,
                    diplomatic reporting, and to analyze it and give policymakers the very best
                    insight and perspective into the meaning of events around the world. That is
                    INR's mission, and I think INR does that job very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, how do you feel your product was
                        used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The use of intelligence by the principals in the department varies. Some
                    of them are keen and avid readers of intelligence. Some limit themselves to
                    reading finished intelligence, that is analysis. Others like to read the raw
                    material itself. The bureaus, the policy bureaus are avid consumers of
                    intelligence. They are all briefed daily by INR so I think that the department
                    make a heavy and very good use of intelligence and takes advantage of the very
                    high quality product that INR produces particularly in the form of the
                    Secretary's Morning Summary, which is a daily review of current events prepared
                    by INR analysts around the clock, seven days a week.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand sometimes that ends up in the White House
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think it is widely read throughout Washington and respected as an
                    astute and very objective product. There is a friendly competition between the
                    Secretary's morning summary and the National Intelligence Digest, which is the
                    similar daily journal produced by the CIA. So there is a friendly competition
                    between the two of them. They are both excellent products. I am biased, of
                    course, I think the Morning Summary is the superior product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Phil, I was reading a book by Admiral Crowe called The
                        Line of Fire, which he talks about intelligence at the time just prior to
                        the Gulf War. It was just a little before the time you arrived there. He was
                        saying he found intelligence, I think he was talking about the CIA and
                        military intelligence tends to always take the worst case scenario so they
                        won't be caught short. They say if such and such happens the world may come
                        to an end and all this. In a way it is sort of covering your behind by
                        showing well we knew something awful was going to happen, but it is not very
                        useful to deal with. What was your impression and were you sort of
                        monitoring our intelligence output to make sure that we were giving good
                        solid you might say middle of the road thing rather than apocalyptic
                        terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: This is, the art of analyzing and evaluating intelligence is an
                    extraordinarily sophisticated difficult one. I think Admiral Crowe's criticism
                    is apt in part because the U.S. administrations over the years have put a very
                    high premium on intelligence and many in the government, many in the Congress,
                    have come to believe that there is something magic and omniscient in
                    intelligence if it works correctly. If the intelligence community is doing its
                    job, it will be able to predict virtually everything with accuracy and
                    foresight. That is not true. It is beyond human capacity to do this, and so I
                    think too much is expected of the intelligence community, and too often after
                    some surprising comeuppance in foreign policy, there is a tendency in the
                    Congress to blame the intelligence community and say this was caused by
                    intelligence failure when in fact it may not have been predictable. So, to cover
                    themselves, some analysts will indeed habitually predict the worst case, read
                    the worst interpretation into intelligence. I think this is a fundamental
                    problem in our system. You have to take the threat intelligence seriously, yet
                    for every piece of clandestinely collected threat intelligence we have,
                    ultimately maybe 10% of those threats are fulfilled. There is a big burden on
                    the intelligence people to weigh and analyze that, and they do error on the side
                    of caution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well too, State sort of occupies I won't say a middle
                        ground, but it occupies a position where you are not saying all right we
                        have to have our missiles prepared to do thus and so as the military does,
                        so we can take a little more of a perspective as they say.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WILCOX: That is true. Military intelligence is often colored by their own
                    professional and budget priorities, too. The military mission is to protect our
                    security. They are accustomed to very large budgets, and the most sophisticated
                    and capable weaponry. They do not always have a sense of budgetary priorities
                    for other needs in our society. They want the best and the most. They are
                    inclined to take a more dire view of security around the world, perhaps
                    subconsciously, perhaps consciously, because that enhances their ability to
                    mobilize resources and large budgets. Now there are many very able and capable
                    military intelligence analysts, but I think that is an occupational hazard in
                    military intelligence, that it tends to be landed in worst case. State, on the
                    other hand, is less encumbered by that, but no agency is completely unbiased.
                    There is no such thing as total objectivity in analyzing intelligence. The
                    Department of State has a mission to maintain peace, to try to resolve
                    conflicts. There is I think a kind of built in optimism and faith among
                    diplomats that the worst can be avoided through good diplomacy and hard work. So
                    it is not only the military that has an occupational bias.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came in in '91, and this was sort of the end of
                        the Cold War. It also seems that we are not talking about clandestine fancy
                        intelligence, we are talking about real interpretation of the fact that here
                        is our great adversary that sort of collapsed from within. At least you were
                        sort of untainted by this, but I would have thought there would have been
                        sort of a tremendous look in the intelligence community, particularly with
                        the State Department because this was their baby really, what the hell
                        happened, our big adversary imploded, and we weren't really seen to be
                        predicting this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think historically, this was a failure of U.S. intelligence analysis.
                    We were so preoccupied with the confrontation with the Soviet Union and the
                    danger that it presented to us that we did not notice the weakness in that
                    system and its decay. The glasnost, perestroika, and ultimately the fall of the
                    Soviet Union took us by surprise. There were analysts who had devoted their
                    career to the Soviet Union that were still skeptical that change was really
                    taking place up to the end. I think the intelligence is always in danger of
                    being tainted by policy needs and ideology. It is a constant struggle to be
                    dispassionate and objective. There is also a lack, a shortfall, in our
                    intelligence community of analysts who speak the languages, who read all the
                    literature not just the secret intelligence, and who are genuine experts in
                    their area of concern. I think that has affected the quality of the CIA's
                    product. I think INR does a little better in that respect, but INR has been
                    weakened by severe budget cuts. The CIA has a tendency to move its analyst
                    around. They are much more heavily layered. They probably have too many
                    analysts, and that creates a kind of bureaucratization and homogenization of the
                    product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling when you arrived at INR that we have
                        got to do something sort of to look back to see what we did wrong? I'm not
                        talking about finger pointing and blame taking, but I mean looking at the
                        system and saying in a way we missed the big one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>WILCOX: I don't know whether there was that process of formal introspection to
                    discover what had gone wrong. I did not participate in it, and INR did not have
                    such a project in my time there. I don't know whether the CIA did. My sense is
                    that there was not a kind of frank reappraisal of why that historic change had
                    not been detected earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is in a way what I, one reason why we have this
                        oral history program, to try to capture the feelings at the time, and maybe
                        somebody at some point will start looking at it. I think it is a great fault
                        of the Department of State of not examining itself. The military it is
                        easier I realize. They would say if we had only gone around the left flank
                        rather than the right flank we might have done better. You know, you can
                        have after action reports. But for us, it is well we won that one or we lost
                        that one and move ahead. The latest one was we didn't have a peace plan
                        ready in Iraq at the end of the Gulf War. It was a terrible diplomatic
                        failure. I mean this is sort of a broad discussion right now, but did you
                        see any tendency to get better at examining what we did right what we did
                        wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No, I didn't. I'm not saying there wasn't some formal effort somewhere;
                    there may have been Congressional hearing by some intelligence oversight
                    committee or the foreign affairs committee, I don't know. I was not here at the
                    time. It took place while I was still in Jerusalem, but I quite agree. I think
                    there should be this process of conscientious review of what went wrong built
                    into the system. I think the fact is there were so few people in the U.S.
                    government or the Congress that anticipated this, that there wasn't a large
                    group who could say we told you so; let's have a board of inquiry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is this funny thing about the Soviet Union. People for
                        years have been coming back. We are talking about tourists and say God this
                        place is awful. It really doesn't work. They had a good military, but the
                        military probably wasn't as good as we thought it was too, but somehow this
                        didn't get into the thinking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, we of the Cold War created kind of an easy and greatly
                    oversimplified view of the world and of U.S. foreign policy that was convenient.
                    It provided a framework, and over the decades, we became quite comfortable with
                    that framework. It would be a hard thing intellectually to break out of it, so I
                    don't think it is all that surprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As basically director or deputy director of INR in this
                        '91-'94 period, the Cold War is basically over. Iraq and Iran have been
                        neutralized more or less. Where were you turning your priorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, our focus was global. We tried to have good people keep up with
                    events everywhere. We had good analysts who covered Africa who quite accurately
                    predicted and analyzed the slaughter in Rwanda. We had very good Soviet and
                    Russian analysts as well who followed the evolution of the Yeltsin government.
                    We probably paid less attention to trade and economics than to political events.
                    We didn't have the resources to follow economic analysis intensively although we
                    had a small office. We paid lots of attention to the Middle East, to the Gulf,
                    and to the Arab-Israeli conflict and reported intensively on the continued
                    growth of Israeli settlements. For example, after the Madrid peace conference,
                    we saw a need to provide daily tactical intelligence analysis to policymakers
                    who were involved in particular projects and missions and to get the
                    intelligence media to concentrate on the collection of information on those
                    events so that it could be analyzed, synthesized very rapidly for the delegation
                    who was out negotiating, and for policymakers who were involved in particular
                    crises. We spent lots of time on eastern Europe and events there, the European
                    Union, NATO affairs, and China as well. I think that the product was good. We
                    spent a fair amount of time on India and Pakistan as well. There again in recent
                    weeks is another example of a failure to anticipate what in retrospect we should
                    have, the Indian nuclear testing and the Pakistani test. One problem I think, is
                    that over the years, we have become too focused on secret intelligence as a way
                    to get at the truth. Secret Intelligence, that is intelligence that is gathered
                    through clandestine means, is important and it has its needs and it is essential
                    in some cases. But while we have devoted enormous resources to gathering secret
                    intelligence, the resources we are investing in overt collection of information
                    have dwindled. The best single source of intelligence is Foreign Service
                    reporting by our political and economic officers. The flow and the quality of
                    that reporting, I think, has declined over the years for lack of adequate
                    reporting staffs overseas and as a product of steep budget cuts. Most
                    intelligence, almost all intelligence analysts throughout the intelligence
                    community, will readily acknowledge that the single most important source is
                    Foreign Service State Department reporting. That was information that astute
                    enterprising officers would find out by getting out on the street and talking to
                    people. It didn't require paying agents or fancy technology. I think there is a
                    missing element here in our overall approach to intelligence. We put too few
                    resources into old-fashioned diplomatic reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well also talking about where our interests were, one of
                        the great changes was the fact that the world was opening up. Our people
                        could really go out and talk to people in the streets of China and certainly
                        in the fall of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The world is sort of the
                        oyster of the political and economic officer as compared to the old days
                        when they were pretty much confined to the barracks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: And there always has been a kind of overlap in the collection of material
                    between the efforts of State Department political sections and other
                    intelligence gatherers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, and there is a weakness in information that is collected through
                    clandestine agents. Sometimes it is brilliant; sometimes it is critical, but you
                    have to temper your confidence in that kind of information by the realization
                    that the people you use are being paid for it. That can sometimes color what
                    they are telling you. There is also, I think, an over reliance on technology.
                    Technology is very important. We have brilliant means, but we spend a minuscule
                    portion of our overall budget for gathering information [from] the most
                    important single source, that is Foreign Service reporting. In a time when the
                    world is opening up, there is so much more opportunity to go out and talk to
                    people, [but] we [are] closing consulates and cutting back embassy staffs, and
                    really reducing our ability to pursue a much greater opportunity for gathering
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that our economic and trade intelligence
                        analysis was rather short in the INR at the time. This would strike me as
                        also a real problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, I am not sure. The private sector, while the U.S. government has
                    pulled back from its engagement around the world in many ways, the American
                    private sector has expanded in a very aggressive and enterprising way. The
                    private sector has marvelous resource for gathering and analyzing trade and
                    commercial and financial information. The U.S. government should not try to
                    compete with it. There are some areas where information is not available to open
                    sources, and that is where we should and where we do concentrate our
                    intelligence assets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm trying to figure out what the role at the top would be
                        as the director and deputy director since you essentially played both roles.
                        What are you trying to do in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>WILCOX: INR, I think it is fair to say, perceives itself as the conscience of the
                    intelligence community and tries to minimize bias, distortion, ideology, and the
                    influence on the intelligence product [of] policy. The intelligence community
                    produces what are called national intelligence estimates on many subjects. These
                    are collective products in which all the agencies contribute. They are reviewed
                    by the National Intelligence Advisory Board. An INR principal sits on that
                    board, so INR has a strong voice in these intelligence products. Then INR
                    produces its own products. INR has a voice in shaping the collecting of
                    intelligence by conveying to the collection agencies what the Secretary of State
                    and the Secretary's deputies need. INR plays a very active role in making sure
                    that the sensitive activities, the clandestine activities of the intelligence
                    community, are in harmony with our policy, and that is a major role for INR, the
                    intelligence coordination role. The Assistant Secretary under whom I served,
                    Toby Gati, was an activist, extremely energetic, talented person who was
                    committed to getting more resources for INR. She was able to get very
                    substantial funding that the department was unable to get in the past for a new
                    state of the art computer system which was desperately needed by our analysts.
                    She did a terrific job in that respect. She had help from one of the other
                    deputy assistant secretaries, Jennifer Simms, who had served on the Senate
                    oversight committee and knew the committee appropriation process, the
                    congressional appropriation process very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Toby Gati's background? She was a Russian specialist who spoke fluent
                    Russian. She had gotten to know the Russian dissident community before the fall
                    of the Soviet Union and was a genuine expert in Russian affairs. She came to the
                    White House having served [with] the UN Association in New York. Perhaps she was
                    the deputy. She became a member of the NSC staff following Soviet Russian
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: President Carter. Then when Doug Mulholland, under whom I worked.
                    Actually I worked for Doug Mulholland who was Jim Baker's assistant secretary
                    for eight months. Toby Gati succeeded Doug Mulholland when the administration
                    changed and President Clinton came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came in '91. The election was '92, so she came in
                        with the '93 group. Did you see a different thrust at all towards INR or
                        pressures on INR with the new administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>WILCOX: No, I think, Secretary Baker took good advantage of INR's resources, as
                    did Secretary Christopher and Secretary Albright. The department because it was
                    under desperate financial pressure, had not been able to fund INR's needs. That
                    was our major preoccupation, saving people, getting some budget so we could do
                    our job adequately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously coming out of Jerusalem, you were I'm sure,
                        casting a wary eye on how things were working in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
                        Did you find both within INR, its product and also the intelligence
                        community any caution or concern? I'm particularly thinking of the Jewish
                        American influence. You know, if you come out with something even though it
                        was highly classified analysis you are going to get in trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: No, never. I never saw any analysis by any element of the community on
                    the Arab-Israeli issue that was somehow tainted by politics or caution. That is
                    not to say it was all perfect. I think there was a severe lack of understanding,
                    information, and insight into the Palestinian community up through the late
                    '80s. The Oslo accords took the Department of State and everyone else by
                    surprise. The Israelis and the Palestinians managed that with extreme secrecy on
                    their own. Not to say that was a failure on our part, but it was a surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about this, I don't know if we discussed it last
                        time. I have one of my colleagues who works with me on this oral history
                        program is an Arabist going back to the 1950s, who said although associated
                        with the Arab cause, you might say he understands the Israelis completely
                        because he would never trust the Palestinians because he feels that within
                        that it is too volatile a group, that it would always be pressing for
                        something and that it couldn't be trusted to keep its word mainly because of
                        the volatility of the leadership and all that. What was our feeling toward
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, I think there was some surprise at the historic change that Arafat
                    and the PLO made when they decided to renounce terrorism and acknowledge the
                    existence of Israel and then in the Oslo accords to recognize Israel. There was
                    a kind of implicit recognition by both sides there would be two states. People
                    in Washington were quite impressed by that. They saw it as an act of
                    statesmanship by the Palestinians and by [Israeli Prime Minister] Rabin on his
                    part for his reciprocity. I mistrust theories that one society or another can't
                    be trusted for various reasons. There are trustworthy people and untrustworthy
                    people. The Palestinians are a volatile society with an unformed government.
                    They have not achieved that aspiration for a state. I think they will, but there
                    is bound to be some instability and uncertainty in that enterprise until
                    negotiations get back on the right track and the final settlement involving both
                    the land, the Jerusalem issue, and the resolution of the question of a
                    Palestinian state: [including the] guarantees for security that the Israelis
                    expect and deserve.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the analysis of political development in
                        Israel because these were changing. Russians were coming in, Russian Jews
                        were coming in; the old guard was dying off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think the analysis was quite good. Israel is an open society; people
                    like to talk there, and it is quite easy to gather information there. The place
                    is just exploding with information on all subjects. I think that the
                    administration was a bit surprised by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, although I
                    think Jews were mixed about how that election would go, but by and large, we did
                    a good job of analyzing Israeli politics, and I think in a dispassionate way
                    too. I think most American administrations including the last two have seen the
                    Labor Party as more compatible with U.S. interests and values. So, there was a
                    great sense of relief when Rabin was elected and Shamir was defeated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, India and Pakistan have been neglected by American administrations
                    for many years. In spite of the enormous problems of those societies, their
                    great population, their strategic importance, after the Afghanistan war, where
                    we relied heavily on support from Pakistan to help defeat the Soviet Invasion,
                    we lost interest in Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and India as well. The U.S. over
                    the years has had a kind of scratchy and difficult relationship with India. My
                    own view is that we have not given it the attention it deserves as a great
                    nation, as a democracy, as the second most populous state in the world. It
                    deserves more attention. It is a complicated and serious place.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: Yes, there was. There was a concern about communal violence and terrorism
                    in both India and Pakistan. Interest in India waned to some extent when it no
                    longer became a player in the Cold War. But more recently during the Clinton
                    administration, there was growing interest in India as a market for U.S. goods
                    and services and for the transformation of India from a neo socialist economy
                    into a market economy, and some progress was made in that respect, particularly
                    under Ambassador Frank Wisner who was a very dynamic, capable ambassador who
                    pressed this cause with the Indians.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Indonesia? You know one of the charges sort of
                        laid on the Foreign Service, and I'm using it in the broadest sense
                        including military, CIA and everything, we are sort of a status quo type of
                        an organization. We don't like things messing up. Here is a country
                        obviously in the time we are talking about now, nothing major happened but
                        things were bubbling. In fact all of Asia were making some pretty horrendous
                        choices on economics which we are suffering from right now. Were we looking
                        at, particularly in Indonesia but elsewhere bout saying you know these guys
                        are lending too much money and going into debt, that type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I think we were lulled into a false sense of security and complacency
                    about Southeast Asia by all the publicity about the new Asian tigers and how
                    they had solved the problem of government and economic development. [I don't
                    think] we fully understood the structural weaknesses, particularly in Indonesia.
                    I served in Indonesia 25 years ago. Not to be self serving, but when I left,
                    before I left, I wrote some very long analyses of the problem of political
                    corruption there with all of the Suharto family aggrandizing themselves with
                    enormous wealth and saw that this was a threat to future stability. I was
                    surprised that in later years Indonesia had thrived, notwithstanding this. It
                    took 20 years, I think, for this massive corruption and structural weakness and
                    the lack of any real democratic institutions to catch up. I don't think the
                    intelligence community or the government anticipated this. Indonesia was sort of
                    off the screen. It was a country that was working well; we didn't pay attention
                    to it. I must say, the world is a big place. For us to have to deploy the kinds
                    of resources to pay the attention that these places deserve costs a lot of
                    money, so we have to establish some priorities. That said, I think we have
                    really shortchanged our ability to understand the world, to report back to
                    Washington, to keep abreast of events around the world, and to engage with
                    foreign governments, and business communities because we have been investing
                    such a pittance in the budget for those things. It wouldn't cost very much
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us back to my earlier question on the economic
                        side. Businesses do a lot, but at the same time we are talking about what I
                        mean, right now what is happening in Asia which for the historian in future
                        eras, the economic situation from Japan to Indonesia to Thailand, and the so
                        called tigers for the most part is really beginning to unravel because of
                        cronyism, bad loans and all that. I mean this is in a way where the United
                        States government could be paying attention to economics. The businessman is
                        looking for what does it mean for selling widgets or producing widgets, but
                        we are looking at the stability of governments. This one is really
                        threatening the whole business.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Our tendency is of course, to vote for stability. Although we recognized
                    the Indonesian government was not a democratic government with a good deal of
                    corruption, the thing seemed to be working, and we didn't recognize the
                    underlying weakness. We did, however pay a great deal of attention to the human
                    rights failings of the Indonesian government. Indeed we seemed to fixate on
                    these particularly on the problems of East Timor. In my judgment, we might have
                    shifted our priorities a little bit and looked more closely at the economic
                    problems and political problems in Indonesia. It became more difficult for us to
                    speak to the Indonesians candidly and frankly about a lot of problems because we
                    paid so much attention to their human rights failings. The Indonesians badly
                    blundered in the way they dealt with the East Timorese insurrection, but the
                    secession of East Timor and the creation of an independent republic there would
                    create a genuine threat of centrifugal forces leading other ethnic minorities in
                    the Indonesian archipelago to break away, so they had a genuine reason for
                    caution about East Timor, not to excuse their very heavy handed human rights
                    violations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about China? Here you came in not too long after the
                        June, '89 Tiananmen Square massacre and the really cooling of relations with
                        China. How were we looking at China, I'm talking about your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We looked at it as a very important country. We had two superb China
                    analysts who spoke Chinese, read the literature, really knew what was going on,
                    and could describe it for policymakers. The debate, of course, waxed and waned
                    over [whether] human rights or trade would dominate our China agenda. I think
                    the administration, eventually after some lurching about, struck the right kind
                    of balance between the two culminating in the Clinton visit. We also saw China
                    as a very important factor in the Korean peninsula, and we engaged with the
                    Chinese on the North Korean problem. We [have] spent a lot of time in recent
                    years worrying about North Korea, trying to analyze events in that impenetrable
                    country, and working on the North Korean nuclear issue. INR, I think, played a
                    stunning role in analyzing events in North Korea and North Korean intentions
                    with respect to its nuclear power plants and weapons policy. INR was the odd
                    agency out in the intelligence community debate on this. The other elements took
                    a worst case view that the North Koreans would not make peace, [and] were
                    developing nuclear weapons. Whereas, INR said there was a chance that they might
                    change and took a less dire view of their actual capabilities. INR was correct
                    in the long run. I think that the INR analysis helped to form what was really a
                    brilliant diplomatic initiative by the Clinton administration to talk the North
                    Korean regime out of an incipient nuclear weapons program and the beginnings of
                    some kind of communication with the south. That was an example of where
                    unorthodox objective intelligence analysis, I think, really served policy
                    well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In China, one of the big questions is really whither
                        China. I would think there would be several ways one could look at it. One,
                        it is such a big country it might start falling apart and end up with a
                        bunch of warlords and all that which is not out of sight. Another one is
                        that the regime will be able to perpetuate itself. Another one would be that
                        the Chinese are eager to get involved in the world. Over a quarter million
                        Chinese students have been to the United States and returned and elsewhere
                        with the Internet and all that China might gradually move into the more
                        democratic field. We are talking about the '91-'94 period. I would have
                        thought this would have been a major debate and a major focus of INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes it was, although there was no crisis. Crisis tends to focus analysis.
                    The biggest crisis in Asia at that time was the so-called North Korean nuclear
                    threat, and that was our biggest preoccupation. There is not a lot of searching
                    analysis in the intelligence community about what is going to happen 10-15 years
                    out. That kind of analysis is very hard to do. It is highly speculative. I think
                    there is some humble recognition that none of us are very shining futurologists.
                    Most of the analysis on China was a more short-term nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about policy planning. I mean policy planning in each
                        administration varies. I mean sometimes it is just the speechwriters. But I
                        would have thought there could have been a relationship between INR and
                        policy planning. Let's take China, you know for policy planning they would
                        be the ones that would take what is happening, look at centrifugal forces
                        working on China, democracy's continuation and all that. Did you find any
                        relationship there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, policy planning in the State Department has not prospered over the
                    years. The office of policy planning has been used by different Secretaries in
                    different ways. Increasingly it has become a kind of staff adjunct to the
                    Secretary's office doing special projects, giving advice on delicate issues. It
                    is now less than a fully staffed office that looks at the entire world in depth.
                    Also, policy planning over the years has never been welcomed by the regional
                    bureaus who view themselves as responsible for policy. So, since the days of
                    George Kennan when it prospered, it has not really fulfilled its theoretical
                    mandate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with the CIA during this time. I mean
                        you had two, you had the Bush administration and then the early part of the
                        Clinton administration. The CIA under Ronald Reagan had gotten rather
                        political hadn't it with William Casey? By this time had you found a shaking
                        out? Was it a different CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes, the CIA, I think, by and large has gotten a bad rap because of the
                    excesses of some of its directors who were responding to ill advised political
                    initiatives by their bosses. But for the most part, the personnel of the CIA
                    intelligence community were smart, loyal, patriotic, hard working professionals.
                    The CIA was corrupted during... There was also a tendency in the '80s to cook
                    the intelligence. You served up the product the policymakers wanted to hear and
                    to bend it to current needs. Casey, I think has been justly criticized for
                    that.</p>
                <p>There was a recognition of that after the Clinton administration came in. There
                    were also, of course, a series of searching hearings by the Congress, a lot of
                    inquires into the intelligence community and what it ought to be doing. It
                    became more sober and responsible, the leadership became more responsible and
                    sober under Jim Woolsey who took over from Bob Gates and John Deutch, and now
                    George Tenant. The State Department as the parent foreign affairs agency is
                    charged with coordinating intelligence and monitoring intelligence activities.
                    That's very difficult role because these agencies are vastly larger than the
                    State Department. Their budget dwarfs the State Department, huge personnel and
                    advocates, and for that reason they have a tendency to go their own way and have
                    a sense of their own worth and internal bureaucratic needs. So, it is not easy
                    for a secretary of state much less an assistant secretary in INR to instruct or
                    direct a DCI. These are powerful agencies, and so there is a lot of diplomacy
                    between the State Department and the intelligence community. In my own view, the
                    Department of State has not always exercised its oversight role as vigorously as
                    it should have, but State policymakers are preoccupied; they have lots of things
                    to do. They don't want to spend all of their time fighting with the CIA. Now,
                    there are also areas of very close, successful collaboration. It isn't all
                    friction and adversary relationship. [There is often] a broad sense of
                    collegiality and teamwork, although that is not always the case. You get a wall
                    between the embassy and their intelligence counterparts which is very
                    counterproductive. It shouldn't be that way, and usually that is the fault of
                    the ambassador who has a mandate to supervise his entire mission. Not all of our
                    ambassadors have carried out that presidential mandate with full vigor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about sort of on the nuts and bolts of INR, did you
                        have trouble recruiting well picking both civil servants and Foreign Service
                        officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: We did. INR is not seen as a route to rapid promotion, so we had trouble
                    getting good officers, although we did. We worked hard at it. Many of the more
                    senior Foreign Service officers in recent decades have done duty in INR during
                    their career, and that has helped maintain a clientele at the top for INR's
                    work, but these people sort of labor silently in the shadows. They don't get a
                    lot of profile on the seventh floor; they don't get bylines for their products.
                    It takes a kind of discipline and scholarly dedication. It is hard work to do it
                    right, so it is always a struggle to get the right people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find that you were able to get support from
                        the director general of Foreign Service personnel because part of the
                        problem is the Foreign Service Act of '82 talked, I mean it usually ends up
                        you want to be in a command position either being a staff assistant to a
                        very senior person in the State Department or having a lot of people under
                        your command. I would have thought the INR, the Foreign Service Act would
                        work against the INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: There was, in recent years, a lot of emphasis on management skills as a
                    route to promotion, and in INR you don't get that much of that kind of
                    management experience. So, it is remarkable that officers still go to INR and do
                    excellent work, but it is always a struggle. The system is not a directed
                    system; it is a negotiated system where you have to go and recruit your own
                    officers. The office of director general is kind of a mediator, but it doesn't
                    really weigh in heavily in most personnel disputes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, let's say you</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It doesn't have the mandate to do that from the secretary of state so the
                    directors general can't crack the whip whenever they want to because the seventh
                    floor doesn't wish to have them play that role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you have the Foreign Service side, but in many ways
                        the backbone of INR has been civil servants hasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Yes. Absolutely, and some of the finest analysts are civil servants and
                    have been there for many years and who are renowned experts, linguists. Perhaps
                    over the years, the best of the INR analysts have been civil servants. There are
                    also some time servers and marginal performers in civil service and INR, a few
                    of them, but many INR civil servants are terrific. It is a struggle to retain
                    them because the civil service cohort in the Department of State lacks the kind
                    of promotion opportunities that it needs to maintain high morale. There really
                    ought to be some special dispensation for more senior grade positions for
                    excellent intelligence analysts. There also, to come back to the problem of
                    funding, there are very few travel funds in INR, so analysts seldom have
                    opportunities to visit their countries, which is criminal, frankly.</p>

                <p>WILCOX: I became the Coordinator for Counter Terrorism and the Ambassador at
                    Large, heading an office established years ago in the State Department that
                    reports to the secretary of state. This office was created to respond to the
                    growing incidents of anti-U.S. terrorism back in the '70s. It went through
                    various transformations, and is now well established. I came to the job I think
                    because of my intelligence background and my experience in the Middle East.</p>

                        '94 to when?</hi>

                <p>WILCOX: To '97 when I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what you were doing in this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The U.S. has been disproportionately targeted by international terrorists
                    over the years, and it has always been a preoccupation of U.S. policymakers to
                    reduce the risk of terrorism. Our ability to do that has been bedeviled over the
                    years by a lack of coherence and unity among U.S. government agencies who have a
                    stake in counter terrorism, that is the FBI, the Department of Justice, the
                    Department of Defense, the CIA, and the State Department. It was recognized some
                    time ago that there had to be better coordination, and so the State Department
                    was designated the lead agency to coordinate policy and operations for
                    international terrorism.</p>
                <p>That system failed during the 1980s when Ollie North and others in the basement
                    of the White House conspired with the CIA to run their own counter terrorism
                    operations, which led to the Iran-Contra scandal. Arms sales to Iran were the
                    most stunning example of that folly. We violated our own terrorism policy by
                    selling arms to the Iranians in an effort to get the release of the Lebanon
                    hostages. The result, of course, was that further hostages were taken. So, the
                    process of coordination worked at some times and failed at other times depending
                    on the ability of the leadership of the Department of State to weigh in and
                    insist on discipline and coordination. If the President and the White House
                    wanted to do it another way, then no secretary of state could manage the
                    process. George Shultz, of course, was cut out of many of those escapades in the
                    1980s.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>When I came on board as Coordinator for Counter Terrorism, the system had settled
                    down. There was recognition that things had gone wrong, and that a more orderly
                    and professional approach was needed. I found a good degree of cohesion and
                    understanding on policy and practice among our team, the FBI, Justice, Defense,
                    and other agencies, an understanding that foreign policy considerations were
                    important as well as law enforcement considerations, and that there had to be a
                    very careful attention to working with foreign governments where we were
                    investigating or pursuing terrorists overseas. My role was to ensure that this
                    happened and that all the elements of the team were pulling together. It usually
                    worked, although there were the usual prima donnas and turf protectors in the
                    community.We were quite successful in indicting terrorists overseas and
                    persuading foreign governments to extradite them or hand them over through
                    informal renditions. We also took advantage of expanded U.S. laws. Back in the
                    '70s and '80s we lacked the statutes to confer criminal jurisdiction over some
                    kinds of terrorist activities against U.S. citizen abroad. We were more ready to
                    resort to military means, because we didn't have the legal tools to go after
                    terrorists. There was also a different attitude among many foreign governments
                    during that earlier era toward terrorism. Terrorism was highly politicized then
                    because of the Cold War and the Arab-Israeli conflict. During the Cold War, the
                    Soviet Union and its friends often supported terrorist groups. Many third world
                    countries didn't want to take on the Soviets, or had leftists governments that
                    condoned terrorism as “freedom fighting.” Also because of the Palestinian cause,
                    Arab and Islamic countries and many others were often unwilling to vigorously
                    condemn Palestinian or other Arab terrorism that was motivated by anti-Israel
                    policies. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the PLO's renunciation of
                    terrorism, and the advent of the Madrid and Oslo peace process, more and more
                    countries were willing to treat terrorism is a crime, irrespective of the
                    political motive. Arab and Islamic governments were increasingly willing to
                    condemn terrorism for the additional reason that they realized it threatened the
                    stability of their countries, which were increasingly being targeted. So there
                    was a more objective process of criminalizing terrorism around the world and
                    therefore much greater cooperation among governments in going after
                    terrorists.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one I keep coming to mind that is so political in the
                        United States is the IRA, the Irish Republican Army. Could you comment on
                        how we from your perspective dealt with the IRA and its supporters
                        '94-'97?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The policy issue came up when visas were requested by people who had some
                    contact with the IRA. Often those people would get visas, not always, over the
                    objection of the law enforcement community and sometimes my office. The White
                    House, as you know, saw an opportunity early in the Clinton administration to
                    address the conflict in Northern Ireland, and it took some chances. Allowing
                    Gerry Adams to come to the U.S. and to visit the White House was criticized, and
                    there was a lot of criticism at the time, especially in the law enforcement
                    community that the White House was playing politics because of the Irish vote.
                    But Clinton's policy has borne fruit, by encouraging negotiations that have
                    brought about, I hope, an historic change in Northern Ireland. The
                    administration's IRA policy was high risk, but it worked.</p>

                        Jean Kennedy Smith as our Ambassador to Ireland. In this we seem to be
                        weighing in more for the Irish vote than for the policy or not. Was
                        this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: I don't know what was most important in their calculus. My office became
                    involved in immigration and visas, and we were preparing to list the IRA as a
                    designated terrorism organization pursuant to a statute that requires
                    designations of all such organization, The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death
                    Penalty Act that was adopted in 1996. However, as negotiations mediated by
                    George Mitchell progressed and the IRA renounced violence, we took it off our
                    draft list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you see the biggest threat during this '94-'97
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The biggest threat was in the emergence of fanatic groups and individuals
                    that claimed to be acting for Islam. One of these was the Ramsi Yousef gang,
                    which blew up the World Trade Center and which conspired to blow up 12 U.S.
                    aircraft over the Pacific. They claimed to acting for Islam and out of vengeance
                    for the U.S. support for Israel. Another was the Hizbollah, which had earlier
                    bombed the Marine barracks in Beirut. They were almost certainly responsible for
                    the bombing of the Israeli embassy and Jewish Cultural Center in Buenos Aires in
                    '92 and '94, and were backed by Iran. Other assassinations and terrorist attacks
                    were carried out by the Egyptian Gamat Islamiya and the Islamic Jihad. In
                    speaking publicly about such terrorism, we worked hard to distinguish between
                    Islam and criminals like these gangs who were abusing and distorting Islam. Some
                    of them were genuine religious fanatics, others exploited Islam to gain sympathy
                    and justify their crimes and political ambitions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see Iran in those days because I assume with
                        the collapse of the Soviet Union and all, that support for terrorism has
                        ceased.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Well, it hasn't ceased altogether. The U.S. has been preoccupied also
                    with state-sponsored terrorism. By statute, the U.S. designates nations who
                    actively support terrorism. Iran, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, Libya, Iraq, and
                    Cuba are on this list. Cuba no longer supports terrorism, although they harbor
                    some terrorists from former times. Because of this, and for political reasons,
                    we keep them on the list, although they probably don't strictly meet the test
                    for designation any longer.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>State-sponsored terrorism has waned in recent years in part because of growing
                    rejection and criminalization of terrorism. It can't be tolerated whatever the
                    reasons. Libya has been constrained by UN sanctions that were imposed after the
                    Pan Am 103 bombing. Iraq has been more or less contained by the defeat of Iraq
                    in the Gulf War and severe UN sanctions. Iran continues to carry out
                    assassinations of both Iranian and Kurdish dissidents overseas, but there are
                    signs that activity might be declining as the new regime of President Khatami
                    re-appraises policy, although he is not responsible for security and military
                    policy. We have dealt with Iranian terrorism by a series of unilateral U.S.
                    sanctions. We have been unable to persuade our allies in Europe to impose
                    similar sanctions, and we have taken the desperate step, in the Iran-Libya Act,
                    of imposing sanctions against the Europeans for dealing for certain kinds of
                    energy transactions with Iran. This is a U.S. secondary boycott, and it has
                    created real friction between our EU allies and us. The counterpart to that is
                    the Helms-Burton Act concerning Cuba. I think the weapon of sanctions has been
                    successful against terrorists only when there is international support, as in
                    the case of the UN sanctions against Libya and Iraq. When we have tried to
                    impose sanctions unilaterally, they have a poor record of success and are
                    sometimes an impediment to working with offending governments in other ways to
                    change their policies. We haven't stopped terrorism and we have sometimes
                    alienated ourselves from our allies. Combating terrorism is an important U.S.
                    interest, but it is not our only interest, for example, in countries like
                    Pakistan, India, and Iran. I think the Congress has been to ready to use
                    sanctions as a weapon, without critically evaluating whether they work and
                    support our overall interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was probably on your watch that they had the
                        deadly explosion in Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia where one of our military
                        barracks was badly damaged and some 20 or so Americans were killed. What was
                        the reading on that and how did we react from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The Al Khobar bombing and the earlier bombing of the OPM Saudi National
                    Guard headquarters in Riyadh, a U.S. military facility, created a real crisis in
                    the defense establishment and concern about the security of our forces abroad.
                    This coincided with a growing aversion to any casualties to our forces abroad.
                    As a result, billions more are being invested now in protecting our forces
                    against terrorists. As you know, in Bosnia the peacekeeping forces there are
                    very limited in their range of movement and there is great concern there that
                    there will be a terrorist event there. The Department of Defense is very
                    worried, I think with good reason, that if other U.S. forces are killed in acts
                    of terrorism, the Congress in going to demand that the forces be withdrawn or
                    their budgets may be reduced, so it is a big problem. On the other hand, we have
                    to recognize that our forces must sometimes place themselves in the way of
                    danger if they are to do their job abroad. There is no complete guarantee
                    against terrorist attacks. We have lost a great many American diplomats to
                    terrorist attacks, but that hasn't in most cases moved us to withdraw our
                    diplomats. An exception, I regret to say, was our decision to shut down our
                    embassy in Khartoum because of fear of a possible terrorist attack. In recent
                    years, there was a single terrorist attack against an American official in
                    Khartoum, and, in my view, the intelligence community and the White House
                    exaggerated the threat in Sudan. In the early 1970s, our Ambassador, Cleo Noel,
                    and our economic officer, Curt Moore, were murdered by Palestinian terrorists in
                    Khartoum. In contrast to our recent closure of the embassy two years ago because
                    of fear of terrorism, we kept our embassy open after Noel and Moore were
                    murdered, and sent a new charge out within a few days. I think we made a mistake
                    in closing our embassy in Sudan recently on the basis of a generalized,
                    non-specific threat of terrorism. This was a victory for terrorism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the counter terrorism community react to the Al
                        Khobar bombing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Because U.S. criminal statutes were violated by that attack, the FBI was
                    sent abroad to investigate the crime in cooperation with the government of Saudi
                    Arabia. The Saudi Arabian government consented to this. But relations between
                    the FBI and the Saudi authorities were troubled, because of vastly different
                    cultural and legal approaches and Saudi political sensitivities. They didn't
                    give the FBI a free reign to investigate in their country and this created
                    strain. The authorship of the crime has never been discovered to this day,
                    although the working hypothesis, based on uncertain evidence, was that Iranian
                    agents were responsible. Leaks from the FBI and unwise remarks by U.S.
                    officials, for example a statement by Secretary of Defense Cohen that if Iran
                    was responsible, the U.S. might attack Iran made the Saudis doubly shy. At the
                    time, they were in the process of improving relations with Iran and that last
                    thing they wanted was a U.S. attack on their large neighbor.</p>

                        abroad, and the FBI sort of being the agent designated to look into this
                        thing, Was there any attempt to work with the FBI in a training program to
                        have a cadre of you might say internationally politically sensitive
                        investigators?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>WILCOX: The FBI is developing such a cadre of legal attaches who are part of the
                    Foreign Service at large. They are good officers who, having lived abroad, often
                    speak foreign languages and are sophisticated, sensitive people. They
                    understand, better than the FBI's domestic cadres, that when you are dealing
                    abroad, you have to deal carefully with local political and cultural realities
                    in order to succeed. That said, when there are major crimes, most of the
                    investigators come from Washington, and so they need to be briefed and have to
                    be sensitized. [FBI Director] Louis Freeh, with whom I worked, was receptive to
                    counsel from the Department of State. I had a very close relationship with him
                    and his counter terrorism deputies, and I found them thoroughly professional
                    people. I had a lot of admiration for most of our FBI colleagues, with the
                    exception of a few who were secretive and overly turf-minded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we working to develop you might say a Washington
                        investigatory cadre of the FBI to, you know certain number of people are
                        going to have to deal with explosives. I mean you kind of know what you
                        need. I would think that it would be possible to develop a team that would
                        be sensitized and knowledgeable of foreign cultures before it went out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: They are doing this to the extent that they have a growing corps of legal
                    attaches. In the end, it is up to our ambassadors to make sure that all American
                    officials in their countries are protecting U.S. foreign policy interests and
                    not operating unilaterally. State-FBI-embassy coordination was excellent in
                    Pakistan where the government was extraordinarily helpful in helping us to
                    arrest Ramsi Yousef and bring him back to the U.S. We had superb support from
                    our embassy and our ambassador, John Monjo, and his deputy, John Holzman. We
                    were very successful in a similar operation where we brought back from a foreign
                    country Mir Amal Kansi, the fellow who killed CIA colleagues at Langley. In that
                    case, I asked Secretary of State Albright to weigh in with Prime Minister Nawaz
                    Sharif, and we got great cooperation. It is a model exercise in inter agency
                    coordination here and abroad. We did the same thing in the Philippines when we
                    stopped the airline bombing plot, and we have done it in a number of other
                    cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the home grown problems of the '70s and
                        '80s. I am thinking of the Japanese red army, the red brigade in Italy, and
                        well there was the Bader Meinhof gang and all of that. Have those things
                        sort of it is a different climate or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Remnants of those groups still at large. The Japanese government is still
                    searching for some of the Japanese Red Army terrorists. But these radical groups
                    have almost vanished. There is more concern in Europe now about Middle East
                    terrorists, Algerians, Egyptians and others. There was a concern that terrorism
                    might emerge from the conflict in Yugoslavia. It hasn't in fact.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Terrorism is a very volatile and emotional subject. I think we have made progress
                    in what I call the criminalization of terrorism and the use of the law as our
                    primary weapon against terrorism. We now have strong laws that enable us to
                    operate around the world with the help of host governments. This makes it less
                    necessary to consider using extraordinary means like military retaliation. We
                    have superb military forces that are available for such missions.</p>
                <p>In Lima a year ago Christmas, when the MRTA terrorists captured the Japanese
                    embassy with scores of diplomats inside including seven Americans, the Americans
                    were released within a week. We thought they would use our hostages for
                    bargaining purposes. Instead they released them, while holding on the others. I
                    speculated that the MRTA may have reacted to a rumor circulating in Lima that
                    U.S. special forces were there poised to storm the embassy and rescue our
                    hostages. That was not true in fact, but the terrorists may have feared such a
                    strike by our forces. Having such skilled hostage rescue forces available is an
                    effective deterrent. The use of military force to carry out retaliatory attacks
                    against terrorists or terrorists states is another issue. We did retaliate
                    against Libya after the bombing of the La Belle discotheque in Berlin in the
                    '80s. Perhaps out of revenge, a few years later the Libyans bombed Pan American
                    103 and killed hundreds of Americans and other civilians.</p>
                <p>There is a dilemma here. We may be legally justified to retaliate militarily as
                    an act of self-defense, but we have to reckon on the potential for counter
                    retaliation. There was a lot of talk in the press about retaliation against Iran
                    after the Al Khobar attack, but we had no firm basis for incriminating Iran in
                    that case, so I think all such talk was premature. The military understands the
                    limits of force and sometimes has a more sober appreciation of that than some
                    civilians do.</p>
                <p>Intelligence is very important in identifying terrorists, monitoring their
                    movements, and going after them, and the intelligence community is doing a very
                    good job at this.</p>
                <p>Our preoccupation with terrorism is justified because of the fear it causes and
                    the disruption it causes. But in fact the actual number of lives lost American
                    lives lost to terrorism is quite small compared to the other kinds of violence.
                    In 1995, 25,000 American were victims of common murders in this country, whereas
                    only 200 or so Americans killed by terrorists overseas and in the U.S. and that
                    was an unusually high toll because of the Oklahoma City bombing. So we have to
                    keep our perspective about terrorism as only one of many forms of violence, and
                    a relatively insignificant one, comparatively speaking. The victims of other
                    forms of violence, whether political or simply criminal, vastly exceeds the
                    number killed in terrorist attacks. Sometimes we play into the hands of
                    terrorists, whose main objective is to create fear, by overacting and
                    sensationalizing the topic. But given its human interest quality, perhaps that
                    is inevitable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you put into gear in the Oklahoma City bombing
                        when it first came off because there were I remember there was talk about
                        Middle Eastern looking type people and people who had been arrested and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: After the World Trade Center bombing, there was a great concern about the
                    threat of Middle Eastern terrorists in the United States. So, immediately after
                    the Oklahoma City bombing, a lot of so called experts went on television and
                    said this had all the marks of a terrorist attack by radical Muslims or elements
                    from the Middle East. That was all over CNN. An Arab American, I don't know if
                    he was a citizen or a green card holder, in Oklahoma City was identified in
                    Chicago in an airport talking on a telephone. Someone there thought he looked
                    suspicious and he was detained temporarily. The Arab-American community was
                    incensed that the seemed to be pointing the finger at Arab Americans. In fact,
                    immediately after the bombing, the first working hypothesis of the FBI was that
                    this was a domestic crime by right wing anti-government Americans, with no
                    Middle Eastern links, and that it might be in retaliation to the FBI's raid in
                    Waco. They were right, and within days they discovered McVeigh and his gang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during the 1996 Olympics? There was a bomb that
                        went off. I imagine your office would have been on high alert during the
                        Olympics anyway just because of the nature of it and particularly with what
                        had happened in Munich.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: The FBI, the Secret Service, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security in State
                    had worked closely other governments to ensure adequate security for the Atlanta
                    Olympics, a massive effort. There was an inter agency command center there. The
                    bombing happened anyway, proving that such things are not entirely preventable.
                    There was a frenzy of activity afterward, as you know. This sensitized other
                    governments to the need for better security for such international events. My
                    office held a conference in Hawaii last year to invite foreign governments to
                    discuss together security for major events.</p>
                <p>I made many trips abroad, usually with colleagues from other agencies, to talk to
                    foreign governments about how we could work with them against terrorism. We had
                    a remarkable meeting of Arab security and counter terrorism officials here in
                    Washington after the bus bombing attacks in Israel to discuss cooperation
                    against terrorism, something of a precedent. Palestinian and Israeli officials
                    also attended, which was unprecedented. But such meetings that included both
                    Israeli and Arab counter terrorism experts could not be repeated thereafter
                    because of the deterioration of the peace process. Still, there has been a
                    tremendous increase in the tempo of diplomatic, law enforcement, and
                    intelligence cooperation in counter terrorism.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>A new preoccupation in the U.S. counter terrorism community is the threat of the
                    use of materials of mass destruction by terrorists. Some have speculated that
                    religious fanatics and other apocalyptic terrorists like the Aum Shinrikyo in
                    Japan who gassed people in the subway will use biological and chemical
                    substances to kill not just a few but hundreds of thousands or millions of
                    people. The U.S. is making a major effort to address this threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is Syria on the U.S. list of state sponsors of
                        terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: Syria is on the list because it continues to allow radical Palestinian
                    groups as well as the Kurdish Marxist terrorist group, the PKK, to have offices
                    in Damascus. We have asked them to shut down these offices and explained to them
                    that we regard these as terrorist groups because they kill civilians for
                    political purposes. Syria disagrees with our definition and claims these groups
                    are involved in a legitimate struggle against Israel. Syria also has given aid
                    and comfort to the Hezbollah by allowing Iran to export arms through Damascus
                    airport into Lebanon for the Hezbollah military.</p>
                <p>Although we haven't succeeded in changing Syrian policy, we have a very important
                    dialogue with the Syrians on the peace process and the need to resume
                    negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights. Syria has not carried out acts
                    of terrorism since 1986 when Syrian intelligence officials tried to plant a bomb
                    on an El Al airliner leaving Heathrow. The bomb was discovered in the bottom of
                    a bag that a young woman was carrying boarding the aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis of why Syria is still doing this
                        when it sort of has other fish to fry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILCOX: It's a very isolated regime, anAssad is caught in a time warp. I have
                    always thought it would be in Syria's best interest to shut down the groups it
                    harbors in Damascus, but it views them as a card to play in their contest with
                    Israel. In fact, Syria does not allow the groups it harbors to use their offices
                    in Damascus to organize and support terrorism, so they don't provide the Syrians
                    any leverage against Israel. One reason Assad keep the Damascus offices of the
                    rejectionist Palestinian groups open, I think, is to spite Arafat, whom Assad
                    dislikes intensely for his unilateral decision to make peace with Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find cooperation with the Israelis on
                        terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>WILCOX: Very close. The Israelis have needless to say a deep historic concern
                    about terrorism. Their doctrine is different from ours. They carry out
                    assassinations of terrorist suspects to punish and deter terrorism. We prohibit
                    that by executive order. Their policy has contributed to a cycle of terrorist
                    violence, rather than deterring terrorism. For example, there is evidence that
                    the rash of horrible suicide bombings in Israel may have been provoked by
                    Israel's assassination of Ayash, the Palestinian Hamas bombing expert. I think
                    it is a crazy policy, but the Israeli public supports it.</p>
                <p>The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has helped advance his career by
                    manipulating the issue of terrorism and preaching that terrorism is really the
                    cause of Israel's conflict with the Palestinian conflict rather than a symptom
                    of it. He cleverly emphasizes the terrorist threat to obfuscate the real causes
                    of the conflict and uses it to argue that the Palestinians do not really want
                    peace. Netanyahu has argued that there can be no serious negotiations until the
                    terrorism stops, and he holds Yasser Arafat fully responsible for further acts
                    of terrorism. Arafat has not been as vigorous as he should have been in dealing
                    with terrorists, for example, HAMAS the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who oppose
                    him as well as Israel, and he is sensitive to criticism from his own
                    constituency that he should not be Israel's policeman. He has tried to negotiate
                    with these groups to pacify them, but this has not always succeeded. On the
                    other hand, he does not have full control. His security services do not have the
                    capability of stopping this threat altogether any more than the Israelis did
                    when their armies occupied the entire West Bank and Gaza.</p>
