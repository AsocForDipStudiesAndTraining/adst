                <p>Interviewed by: Frank Pavich</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 9, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us some background about your birthplace, education,
                        a little bit about your family - your wife, what your beginnings were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was born in Syracuse, New York on July 14, 1940. I attended local
                    schools and graduated from LeMoyne College with a bachelors degree in political
                    science and history. The emphasis on subjects was international government and
                    constitutional law, economic history of the United States, Russian history,
                    modern Europe, diplomatic history of the U.S., and French and Russian
                    languages.</p>
                <p>I did not travel much outside of New York State for the first 20 years of my life
                    except for occasional trips to Canada with the family. In early childhood, if
                    there was any influence for the Foreign Service when I was a child, I recall
                    crawling up on my father's lap after supper with my geography books and reading
                    to him about exotic lands and places. I think this had a real influence on my
                    career later in terms of wanting to travel overseas and work abroad.</p>
                <p>In my Junior year of college I became interested in the principles and the
                    concepts of the Peace Corps and often spoke to my fellows students about joining
                    the Peace Corps. An event occurred in my senior year of college that actually
                    made me look at the Peace Corps much more seriously. That was the death of my
                    father. I was finishing up my degree and taking final exams when my father was
                    diagnosed with terminal cancer. At that point, I was very unsettled about what I
                    was going to do after receiving my college degree. I stayed at home taking care
                    of my Dad with my Mother.</p>
                <p>I actually applied to the Peace Corps a few months before my Dad died and three
                    days before my father passed away, I received a phone call from Washington in
                    which they indicated that I had been accepted for a program in the tiny country
                    of El Salvador. My father was still well enough to understand when I told him I
                    had been accepted into the Peace Corps. He was delighted to know that I would be
                    doing something for the next two years.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you discover US AID? But before we get to
                        that...what did you do in the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The Peace Corps was one of the most marvelous experiences. I worked in the
                    area of rural development. I didn't know what was in store for me but it
                    actually changed my whole life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: 1963. When I joined the Peace Corps, we were sent to Puerto Rico for two
                    weeks. This was the old Peace Corps training. They put you through physical
                    training at one of their camps in Puerto Rico. Mine happened to be Camp Bradley
                    in the Arecibo rainforest. They posed a variety of challenges to the volunteers.
                    You either accepted those challenges or you didn't. Some people actually refused
                    to do them. Notes were taken carefully during that two week training period of
                    which volunteers would be de-selected from the program. It was a very intensive
                    exercise and included everything from Spanish language training with Berlitz
                    teachers to repelling off Dos Bocas Dam.</p>
                <p>After Puerto Rico, we went on to Los Cruces, New Mexico, where we studied for
                    three months at the University of Los Cruces about various aspects of rural
                    community development including intensive Spanish language training. It also
                    included field trips to Mexico in order to practice our Spanish. By the same
                    token, we had the selection team scrutinizing us closely and telling us that
                    they would be back after a period of time to make their final selections for the
                    country. After this second deselection, we would then learn which volunteers
                    would travel to El Salvador for two years to help the poor and needy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn about development and what did you
                        learn about yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Actually, much of the training was very sophisticated. We would not know
                    how sophisticated at the time because we didn't know what we were going to
                    encounter in the country we were preparing to go to...in this case, El
                    Salvador.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>They were showing us how to slaughter animals for example. The sophisticated
                    methods that we use here in the United States were not very applicable when you
                    learned how they do it in a Third World country. They hack the pig over the back
                    of the neck and then string it up or cut its throat. They use their own means of
                    doing this and the thing is that we did not practice what we learned in that
                    training. We were also shown sophisticated water purification and sewage
                    facilities around Las Cruces that were the farthest thing from what we were to
                    encounter living in rural Salvadoran towns and villages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:What was the basic mission of your Peace Corps group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: We were a mixed group of volunteers. The basic mission was rural community
                    development, health, education and home economics training. At that time (1963),
                    the Peace Corps was recruiting volunteers to do anything to improve the lot of
                    poor people in Third World countries. As the Peace Corps grew and matured,
                    volunteers with specific skills were recruited like doctors, engineers,
                    sanitation experts, etc.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the actual experience like? Tell us something about what happened
                    when you first got there and how you first got into your job and how it affected
                    you? Some of the things you feel you were able to do.</p>
                <p>RYBAK: We arrived at the capital for orientation in San Salvador. After a one
                    week orientation, we were assigned to various villages. I was assigned to a
                    larger town and for two months was part of a U.S. Alliance for Progress (Alianza
                    Para Progresso) Mobile Health Unit composed of a doctor and two nurses. We would
                    travel each day to a different village. My role was to seek out the local
                    village leaders and learn who the important people were that one could work with
                    in each village on the circuit. Those people who showed leadership capabilities
                    might be the local barber but not the mayor. It could be the village grocer, a
                    successful farmer, or a housewife. And that was basically what I did for two
                    months until I was finally assigned to one village. During this mobile
                    assignment, I somehow picked up a skin disease in my groin that took several
                    weeks to diagnose since the Peace Corps doctor had to have the Centers for
                    Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia do the final analysis. Then a
                    specially formulated cream was prescribed and sent to San Salvador, where I
                    picked it up. This was my first encounter with disease overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn from that experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RYBAK: What I learned from that experience was that people whom you thought were
                    village leaders weren't necessarily the people who were the local leaders. It
                    was the people who were perhaps in a profession, like a barber or a seamstress
                    or someone else - a teacher - they showed more leadership, drive, and ambition
                    than some of the local elected leaders who one might think were good, strong,
                    reliable leaders. That was an important experience that came from visiting each
                    of several villages over the two month period before being assigned to one of
                    the villages on the circuit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were in El Salvador in a village for two
                        years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: For two years I lived in a tiny village called San Ildefonso in the
                    department of San Vicente. It is located in the central part of El Salvador and
                    at that time was one of the more remote assignments given to a volunteer. The
                    village of San Ildefonso where I was assigned had no running water, no latrines,
                    an old school, and a dilapidated clinic. There was no electricity but a few
                    richer people had generators. Most of the menfolk were campesino farmers who
                    worked rented plots of land using oxen to prepare the land and harvest their
                    crops. San Ildefonso is located off the Pan-American Highway within sight of
                    Chinchontepec or San Vicente Volcano. The village was the site of a Spanish
                    hacienda before it became a village and most likely the Spanish cultivated
                    indigo; this plant is still the most famous of its kind in Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were a few of the projects that you got involved
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was interesting that I was assigned to one of the villages included on
                    the weekly visits of the Mobile Health Unit to which I was working for the first
                    two months after my arrival in El Salvador. I was acquainted with San Ildefonso
                    from the weekly visits I made on that circuit. Peace Corps supervisors were
                    going to put me in a tiny village called Villa Dolores on the other side of a
                    river which would have isolated me in the rainy season since I would have had no
                    way of getting out of that village. So they put me on the nearer side of the
                    river which at least had access to some transportation, one bus that left early
                    in the morning and returned late in the evening depending on the time of year
                    and condition of the road.</p>
                <p>One of the first projects was a latrine - actually two latrines. One was at the
                    clinic where I was going to be assigned to work. People were coming in for their
                    consultations with the nurse and once a week with the doctor and had no means of
                    disposing of their waste. The other was at my house since otherwise I would have
                    no means of disposing of my own personal waste. Primitive conditions of waste
                    removal existed in the village - people defecated and urinated in fields and
                    yards behind their houses. Pigs then did the removal of feces by eating it - the
                    people eventually would eat the pigs!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anyone supervising you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK:No. I was the only Volunteer assigned to the village. There was no
                    supervision other than to work with the nurse at the clinic. From time to time,
                    Peace Corps supervisors would visit my village but because I was in such a
                    remote area of the country, the visits were far and few between. Of all the
                    Volunteers in my group, I was living in one of the most isolated areas of El
                    Salvador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you had been there for about a year, how did you
                        feel about the Peace Corps, what you were doing, and yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: After a year I felt great. After the first month or so I didn't feel very
                    well because I had not really settled in. I was living behind some packing cases
                    in the clinic. Life was harsh and I was feeling sorry for myself because I
                    tended to think of the good life back in the United States - the good food and
                    all the other things associated with the good life. I realized you have to put
                    that behind you and bear with the situation you are confronted with and make the
                    best of it. And everything turned out better once I moved into my own home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The language wasn't too bad because the people did not speak sophisticated
                    Spanish. This was a small, remote village. People tended to use local
                    expressions which I learned and used. When I would go to the capital, I sounded
                    somewhat like a country hick since I wasn't speaking high level Spanish like
                    educated people. I was in a small village and adapted my Spanish to the people
                    who I was living with in the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your other Peace Corps comrades? How did they
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Most of them did fine. A few of them were eliminated; actually they
                    eliminated themselves by quitting. But most of us stayed. I did eventually have
                    a female volunteer who was not happy where she had originally been assigned. She
                    wasn't able to do much where she was and decided to come to San Ildefonso, take
                    a look around, and see whether she liked it or not. As it turned out, she said
                    she loved it. I never understood why she decided to move to my village but her
                    Spanish language was rather poor and maybe she felt I could help her with some
                    of her programs and projects. San Ildefonso was in a rocky location and the
                    village was nicknamed “la olla” because it was in a depression like the bottom
                    of a pot.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Years ago, San Ildefonso was a hacienda and it was located where the village now
                    stands because it had the only source of water. The village grew around the
                    source of water. But Norma liked it and she was a health expert. Once we
                    adjusted to each other, we accomplished a lot together.</p>
                <p>One of the great projects was a Mother's Care Project. Norma's Spanish was not
                    very good. Mine was better than hers, but she had the health knowledge. We
                    designed a program to educate mothers and their children in using hygienic
                    techniques. They used to tell me that I was very rich even though I lived in a
                    house similar to the rest of the villagers. The reason the villagers thought I
                    was very rich was because I kept my house clean. I told them all of them could
                    be rich, too. All you had to do was keep your house clean by sweeping it every
                    day. This is something we take for granted in the U.S., but the village people
                    looked at it in a different way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that your presence and your colleagues
                        presence there had an impact on the village in the way that it did
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Not right away. They realized that we were different. That we were North
                    Americans from the U.S. and we lived differently than they did. As I mentioned
                    before, one of the first projects was a latrine at the clinic and a latrine at
                    my home. I did not go out in the back and defecate like they did in the bush. I
                    tended to keep my house very clean. I found that example went a long way in
                    demonstrating to the people why we did things the way we did them. The
                    villagers' impressions of the U.S. was that everyone was rich. I don't think
                    they realized thawe had poverty in the U.S., too. However, one could never
                    equate poverty in the U.S. with poverty in the rural areas of El Salvador at
                    that time (1963-1966) or perhaps even now.</p>
                <p>They seemed to like us. I think they used much of what we taught in the mother's
                    class. With that program, in order for a mother to participate, she had to
                    attend weekly sessions that we presented on health and hygiene in the home. The
                    mothers were also responsible for getting the wood, preparing the milk that we
                    brought in from CARITAS, a Catholic voluntary agency, and actuallhad the mothers
                    prepare and distribute the milk to the youngsters who were of pre-school age.
                    Norma and I also planned and implemented an athletic program working with the
                    teachers of the school. We taught baseball, volleyball, and other games to the
                    school-aged children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the conclusion of your Peace Corps tour did your group
                        get together and evaluate the program and come up with lessons learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RYBAK: We did. We did that in San Salvador. In fact we took two or three days for
                    the evaluation. We also discussed where people were assigned, how happy they
                    were with their assignments, what they were able to accomplish, what their
                    feelings were after the two years, and whether or not the Peace Corps was what
                    they expected it to be. We did have the evaluation. And this was attended by
                    officials from Washington who also wanted to know about our two year
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything about development in particular that
                        changed during the two years down in the village?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: One of the things was US AID had a rural health program under President
                    Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, which was very active in El Salvador. We were
                    working very closely with AID people even though they would only occasionally
                    come to the village where I was assigned. They provided us with nothing in terms
                    of products or goods or anything else to make it easier. We had to find those
                    things on our own or be innovative and devise ways to use local resources on
                    hand in El Salvador.</p>
                <p>The AID people visited us to monitor their programs and they used Peace Corps
                    Volunteers to help them monitor their programs and projects. None of them wanted
                    to stay overnight in the village. They wanted to go back to their lavish homes
                    in San Salvador where they had servants and could buy food and goods from the
                    commissary. They would invite some of the Peace Corps people to come to their
                    homes in San Salvador and cook hamburgers for us when we came into town. We
                    literally became the eyes and ears for US AID in the field. And we would report
                    back to them and let them know how their programs were doing in the field.</p>
                <p>I can give you a very good example. I was responsible for getting a doctor fired.
                    The doctor was drunk the night before he was to see the sick in the village and
                    he had sex with a young girl. He was unable to show up the next morning for his
                    consultations with the people, many of whom had traveled long distances from
                    surrounding areas to see the doctor. I telephoned San Salvador and reported to
                    the AID person in San Salvador about the doctor's behavior. That doctor
                    disappeared the next week and a new doctor was assigned to the mobile
                    circuit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a local doctor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: This was a Salvadorian doctor, yes, who was part of the mobile health team
                    that traveled on a circuit and visited San Ildefonso once a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come back to the US from your Peace Corps
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>RYBAK: I came back to the US in June 1966. I actually extended my tour in the
                    Peace Corps because I had an illness. I had contracted infectious hepatitis. I
                    also had a scare with potential cancer. Fortunately for me it turned out to be
                    negative but did require extensive time at Johns Hopkins Hospital. I therefore
                    extended my tour in the Peace Corps and actually went back to the village after
                    Washington asked the people if they wanted me back. They said, “Definitely.” So
                    I extended for three months to make up for my absence in the U.S.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the process that got you into USAID?</p>
                <p>Joined USAID in Vietnam - 1966</p>
                <p>RYBAK: When I came back from El Salvador, like many Peace Corps Volunteers, I did
                    not have a job. I decided because of the positive experience I had in El
                    Salvador I wanted to work in Latin America and I would seek employment with
                    Catholic Relief Services, CARE or some other private voluntary organization
                    active in Latin America. At the time they weren't recruiting for Latin America.
                    I applied to several volunteer organizations and each time I was told they
                    didn't have any jobs available.</p>
                <p>I happened to look in the local Syracuse newspaper and saw an AID advertisement
                    recruiting people for Vietnam and I responded to that advertisement. I was
                    invited to Washington and interviewed by a battery of people. I was accepted for
                    AID's program in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they looking for in the interview?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: AID was looking for people who had development experience or had
                    educational background in International Relations or Community Development. I
                    feel the two years in the Peace Corps qualified me for the job in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did AID prepare you for your job in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: We had a three month preparatory training which included everything from
                    living in the country to security measures. It didn't seem that we concentrated
                    a lot on development. They were more concerned about security issues which were
                    necessary because of the war in Vietnam. Whatever we received in development
                    training was basically lectures from people who had experiences with development
                    in Third World countries.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you exposed to any new development theory at this time?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>RYBAK: At that time because Vietnam was building up its programs and AID was
                    building its mission in Vietnam, AID was anxious to get anybody that had any
                    experience in working overseas particularly in international development. That
                    is why the Peace Corps volunteers were picked up quickly by AID. Ex-Volunteers
                    had toughed it out in Third World countries and most Volunteers were interested
                    in working and traveling abroad. Also, ex-Peace Corps Volunteers were more
                    likely to adjust quickly to the conditions in South Vietnam even with an
                    on-going war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you actually arrive in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I arrived in Vietnam in June 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your major duties in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Before I left Washington I knew I was going to be working somewhere in the
                    refugee program.Thousands of displaced persons had been created as a result of
                    the bombing in the countryside villages and wartime conditions. I ended up being
                    assigned to refugee headquarters in Saigon. I was working with the Vietnamese
                    people who were displaced and migrated into the city but were living on the
                    streets of Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the program structured? Did yohave a particular
                        series of tasks that you had to perform?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK:It wasn't very structured at all. It was more or less finding out what
                    needed to be done, talking to your supervisors about doing something about it.
                    Getting out and looking at the situation, coming back with recommendations and
                    then trying to get some real help to those people. The war did not make it easy
                    to do too much advance planning since one never knew when the next wave of
                    migrations to the urban areas would occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there sufficient resources for the work that had to
                        be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: That was one of the things that we never hungered for in Vietnam. There
                    were so many resources available to get community development projects going in
                    Saigon. There was one particular area-District 8-that was a haven for refugee
                    resettlement. AID was instrumental in getting a huge development project going
                    to house the refugees...much better housing than they had on the streets of
                    Saigon and Cholon.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you exclusively working on refugees? Did you have any
                        other assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Basically it was with the refugee population displaced by the war. But you
                    couldn't exclude the rest of the poor either. And that was just the first year
                    or so because I did make some changes while I was there in terms of getting an
                    assignment where I could focus on the poor. And I found that it wasn't through
                    the refugee program. I transferred from the AID Refugee Program to the Office of
                    Public Administration which at that time (1963-1966) had a huge number of AID
                    supported programs and projects. I was assigned to the Municipal Government area
                    and thereby started working with Vietnamese urban officers on projects to assist
                    the poorer segments of Saigon society. These projects involved the local
                    district officials and families living in those districts. We were building a
                    true self-help development program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you feel your major successes were in working with
                        the refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I think the major success in working with the refugees was giving them
                    hope there was a better life than what they had at the time. We were there to
                    help. We were there to make their conditions better and it was demonstrated to
                    them with new development projects being developed such as potable drinking
                    water, housing development, and improved sanitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major problems in implementation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Major problems in implementation included (1) getting people to
                    participate in the program because sometimes they would not show up for the
                    projects and (2) bureaucracy from headquarters by setting other priorities and
                    giving them precedence over what you were working on. However, things pretty
                    much came together and we had some very viable projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after refugees, what was your...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: As I mentioned, I switched out of refugees and into a program where they
                    could focus on these displaced people because refugees was not a term that the
                    Vietnamese government officials recognized. These were truly displaced people;
                    the Government refused to recognize them arefugees. As a result, many of these
                    people were not getting the attention they should have received simply because
                    of an interpretation by the Vietnamese government that these people wandering
                    from villages outside Saigon and fleeing to the city for protection were not
                    considered refugees. In addition to migrants from the south moving to Saigon,
                    the metropolitan area absorbed large numbers of refugees from the north. At
                    least 100,000 North Vietnamese became part of the exodus to Saigon. The real
                    term for these migrant Vietnamese was “war victims” since they fled their towns
                    and villages because of terrorism or the dangers of war.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I went into public administration and I worked with a gentleman who was working
                    in municipal development in Saigon. I assisted him in developing activities and
                    projects we could feasibly support through the public administration office
                    rather than the refugee office of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you continue in that line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I continued in that particular job for about three years. One of the
                    noteworthy things that I remember is going into some of the urban poor areas, if
                    you will, the ghetto areas, and listening to the people. I think that was one of
                    the more important things that we had to do was find out the problems. The way
                    to find out what those problems were was to go to the phuong chief. Phuongs
                    comprise districts and there were five to six divisions within each district. We
                    went to the local officials, to the people themselves. We looked to see where
                    the water levels during the flooding had made marks on the walls of the
                    dwellings. What did they want? They wanted closer sources of drinking water.
                    They wanted better sewage. Their walkways would flood and the water would come
                    in their houses during the rainy season. Therefore, they wanted better drainage.
                    These were the things upon which we focused and we developed a neat little
                    program which was truly self-help like we learned to do in the Peace Corps. The
                    important thing was to get something started and not just talk about it. Talk
                    must be translated into action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the political imperatives that affected
                        your work and program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In that particular program?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in any of your experience up to now in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The fact was if you arranged for the cement or whatever else might be
                    needed to do the project some of it was bound to disappear. And it would
                    disappear into the hands of the officials. You accepted it on the basis there
                    was still enough product left to do the project. You knew they were going to
                    skim off a few bags of cement or some rebar or whatever. Taking that into
                    account, there was always enough product for the project. In other words, a few
                    bags of cement or a couple rebar missing would not prevent the projects from
                    going forward.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>RYBAK: Because I stayed in municipal administration three years, I then moved on
                    to a job at CORDS (Civil Operations Revolutionary Development Support
                    organization). I was working in the social welfare section and particularly in
                    child adoption. I also worked with private voluntary organizations in Vietnam.
                    What we were trying to do was coordinate their programs and focus their
                    assistance so that it wasn't so much a scattered shotgun approach. Actual
                    direction and control of CORDS was directed by Robert Komer, a rather flamboyant
                    bureaucrat who made public statements in South Vietnam by his outlandish
                    uniforms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else interesting about your experience in Vietnam
                        that you'd like to talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Vietnam was really a special situation because you had so many resources,
                    you had so many people, you had so much cement-so much of everything that you
                    could literally try and do anything you wouldn't have the opportunity to do in
                    other countries. It was a testing ground almost, because there was so much money
                    and physical resources available. You could literally do almost anything you
                    wanted to do that was a decent idea. Quite a different approach than the
                    philosophy behind the Peace Corps in which little was provided but much
                    accomplished by using innovation and ingenuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the AID bureaucracy? How did it function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The AID bureaucracy in Vietnam was like the bureaucracy in Washington. The
                    structure was set up very similar. You had your supervisors and you had to
                    report through them and to them. Sometimes they listened to you, sometimes they
                    didn't. But it was just like any other bureaucracy, you lived with it. And you
                    found and learned ways to get around the bureaucracy. But you had to have the
                    experience in dealing with some of these people to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It is very interesting that you bring that up. I remember I was ready to
                    make a break with the agency and I felt you had to have guts to stay with AID.
                    It also took guts to quit. My fellow officers who had reported about the same
                    time as I had in June 1966, became very frustrated with the bureaucracy
                    especially when the promotions were not coming through. I said they had guts to
                    quit. But on the other hand, many of us who stayed I felt had a lot of guts,
                    too. Because it took just as much guts to live with the bureaucracy, to try to
                    do as much as you could while you were there and to carry out your
                    assignments.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The deciding factor for me was a promotion. I knew I was in for a promotion. If I
                    got it, I was going to stay. If I didn't, I was going to make a break with AID.
                    I got the promotion and so I stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got your promotion and your tour in Vietnam ended
                        and you moved on. What was the next place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: While I was still in Vietnam it wasn't clear what I was moving on to. I
                    remember talking to the director of the refugee program and telling him about my
                    concerns of not having a job when I got back to Washington. He had a lot of
                    experience with Washington and bureaucracies and told me, “David, you can go
                    back there and find a job doing dishes and be a grand success at it.” And that
                    gave me a lot of confidence. I never forgot that. At the time, his words gave me
                    a tremendous boost.</p>
                <p>Returned to USAID/Washington to the Foreign Disaster Relief Office - 1972</p>
                <p>When I went back to Washington, I was assigned as a special assistant to the head
                    of the Foreign Disaster Relief Office (FDRC) Coordinator headed up by Russell
                    Tim McClure. That was a neat job. I had that job for about two years. I reported
                    directly to the foreign disaster coordinator. I did a lot of things directly for
                    him...and many significant things. I was his assistant and reported directly to
                    him and no one else. He was former Mission Director to Afghanistan when AID had
                    a program in that country. He was tough to work for but I learned a lot from him
                    about management styles.</p>
                <p>One of the nice things was my independent responsibility to bring together all
                    the PVO's who would respond to a foreign or man-made disaster. At that time,
                    many PVO's would respond but didn't know how to respond by providing the
                    necessary equipment, food or services. As a result, there was a lot of
                    duplication of effort. We worked out a program to provide as much information as
                    we had on the requirements from a foreign disaster and then asked the volunteer
                    organizations to focus on those requirements letting all participants know what
                    the other was doing.</p>
                <p>My job was to coordinate and to bring them together so that we could have more
                    focus by the voluntary agencies. We used to have conferences in New York and in
                    Washington to bring the voluntary agencies' representatives together to explain
                    what we were doing and why we were doing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>A disaster would break out and, of course, operations would go into immediate
                    effect in FDRC. The idea was to ensure that all the voluntary organizations had
                    the same knowledge base about a foreign disaster. We wanted to make sure they
                    were working off the same knowledge, so they could respond more appropriately.
                    When they responded, we asked the voluntary agencies to coordinate with us so
                    that we knew who was giving what kinds of assistance. If someone was giving a
                    particular type of food that had been donated, we would tell them they don't
                    need that but need other specific items. We would point this out to each of the
                    agencies, so there was less duplication of effort among themselves and with
                    AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were working with PVOs and doing coordinating work.
                        Do you feel that what you were doing was having much effect on improving
                        your capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Absolutely. The fact was I was bringing the agencies-the voluntary
                    agencies together in their assistance efforts whereas in the past they had only
                    been getting together among themselves apart from AID. Bringing Washington into
                    the picture and giving them the knowledge that we were getting back from the
                    field, I think assisted them greatly in having better focus to their programs in
                    responding to foreign disasters.</p>
                <p>We worked with the people in New York City at headquarters for voluntary
                    agencies. We conducted a conference once a year to bring the voluntary agencies
                    together in Elkridge, Maryland. The whole idea was to discuss where we were,
                    where we were going, some of the new things that we were doing in terms of
                    sharing information so that everybody worked from the same game plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was 1972 thru 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on in AID during that time in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: As usual a lot was going on. I'm not sure I could articulate appropriately
                    about what else was happening around me since we were mainly concerned with
                    rapid and appropriate response each time the U.S. was asked to assist a country
                    experiencing a natural or man-made disaster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any policy changes or shifts?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RYBAK: There were always policy changes in AID. Policy change was matter of fact.
                    Every day, every month, somebody was changing something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that effect your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Sometimes not directly. It was only if something affected us that came
                    down from the Administrator or from the person that headed up the voluntary
                    agencies. The director of foreign disaster was accountable directly to the
                    Administrator. Normally, we were allowed to function as an independent unit. We
                    had a Disaster Operations Center and we would request other offices, including
                    desk officers to participate in around the clock shifts.</p>
                <p>Planning a career change</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, what were your thoughts about your career?
                        Did you have an idea of where you were heading and what you wanted to do
                        within AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Not at first. When I went to South Vietnam, I went because it was a job.
                    As I progressed in AID, I decided I was going to stay with this agency but
                    preferably do things that I would enjoy doing. If there was a job, I didn't care
                    to do, I learned there are ways to find the job you are looking for. The
                    important thing is to know what that next job is and what you want to do. Then
                    with patience you start making contacts and networking. It might take as long as
                    18 months before there may be an opening in the area where you want to be.</p>
                <p>So many people in AID I talked to told me they had been years in the same job and
                    they were bored and hated their job. I would ask them why didn't they change
                    jobs? They didn't feel t his worked. I would then say, “Do you know where you
                    want to be?” The answer was “No.” I told them, maybe they should sit down and
                    think about where they want to be. And if it's not within AID then maybe AID
                    isn't for them. I believe there are people within AID who lack the motivation
                    and self-confidence to move into another position that might be more exciting
                    and challenging.</p>
                <p>Fortunately in my case, I knew-particularly after Vietnam and after the disaster
                    assignment, the track that I wanted to follow in AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>RYBAK: It is a little difficult to describe because every few years or so I would
                    tend to feel I had learned the job and I was then restless to do something else
                    more challenging and would hopefully lead to promotion. Let me give you an
                    example. After two years in disaster assistance, I realized I didn't want to
                    make it my career. So I began looking around and I realized with bureaucracy you
                    have to be patient because it can take anywhere from a year to 18 months before
                    you can make the change. But it doesn't prevent you from making contacts in the
                    area where you want to be. An example would be switching out of disaster
                    assistance and becoming a population officer. Many of our AID colleagues
                    remember Ray Ravenholt who was heading up the population program. Many people
                    thought this man was a fanatic. On the other hand, if you didn't have a person
                    like Ravenholt driving the AID population program the way he did, I don't think
                    we would have made the strides in population planning that we did in many
                    countries.</p>
                <p>I was in Washington for three months spending a few weeks in various population
                    offices and learning all the private contracts with AID. I also learned who the
                    people were that were back-stopping those contracts - the services provided -
                    with the objective that I would go to Costa Rica on assignment as a population
                    officer and have total familiarity with the resources in Washington.</p>
                <p>In the past, AID sent people for master's degrees in demographics and other types
                    of specialized population training. AID learned this did not work when these
                    people were assigned to the field. They were too sophisticated by learning too
                    many theoretical concepts at the university. They were overpowering to their
                    local counterparts in the countries where they were working. As a result some of
                    these people didn't work out very well. So Washington decided they would try an
                    “on the job” approach and have a population officer go abroad with total
                    knowledge of the services available in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your opinion, did this on the job training work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In the colleges and universities?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. For you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It did because I was totally aware of everything that AID/Washington's
                    Population Office was doing, how they were doing it and who the principals were
                    in the event that I needed to call on them. I frequently requested assistance
                    from Washington to implement the Costa Rican population and health program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did AID prepare you with any kind of training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RYBAK: No formal training. The idea was they had some failures in the past in
                    that respect and therefore few people were going to get master's degrees in
                    demographics or other population studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now it sounds like you are getting ready to make
                        another move. What year are we in now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was in Costa Rica from 1974-1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went from AID Washington to Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In 1974. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your title and job in Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was taking the place of another population officer. Unfortunately there
                    was a mandate from Washington I was to be there “yesterday.” My wife had just
                    had our first child here in Washington and we were literally pushed to get on a
                    plane and get down to Costa Rica since the position down there was vacant. My
                    predecessor had left the job a month before and they needed somebody very
                    quickly - like yesterday - to resume the work in the population office. This was
                    good for AID but bad for us personally because my wife had not been checked out
                    thoroughly here in the United States after having had our first child and we had
                    a very unfortunate incident which I will not go into any detail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you returned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Returned to the USAID Disaster Relief Office - 1976</p>
                <p>RYBAK: I came back to Washington without a job again, but feeling because I came
                    back for family reasons I would not be considered for another position in
                    AID/Washington or anywhere else. This was far from the truth.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>When I came back and actually looked around after telling people about my
                    situation, I was offered ten different jobs. I ended up going back to something
                    with which I felt comfortable - foreign disaster assistance. The interesting
                    thing is when I was interviewed for that job, a lot of people had changed in
                    that office and the deputy director was Christian Holmes. During the course of
                    the interview he asked me if I could write. I told him one learns to write all
                    your life and I felt I was a developing writer. He liked the answer and I got
                    the job.</p>
                <p>My first assignment was to organize the reports to the Administrator on foreign
                    disasters. I didn't have to wait too long because at that time we had a
                    tremendous mud slide in Friuli, Italy. Chris Holmes wanted a report for the
                    Administrator twice a day. I was asked to develop the report and it was
                    something that was implemented after I left that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a situation report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: This was a situation report which gave you the numbers of dead and
                    injured. It also included the number of homes destroyed, infrastructure
                    disrupted, etc. We would change the information as it became available. And
                    again, going back to my previous assignment in foreign disaster assistance, this
                    was particularly useful to the voluntary agencies because we made sure that the
                    daily reports were faxed to them. Everybody was reading off the same “poop”
                    sheet, so to speak. People would know exactly who was doing what. We would
                    record the voluntary agency effort, how much they were giving, what they were
                    giving in terms of money, food, equipment or any other types of services.
                    Incidentally, I was assigned to the Planning Office of Foreign Disaster
                    Assistance.</p>
                <p>Q: And again, this was in...?</p>
                <p>RYBAK: That was 1976-1978 when I went back to that office after coming out of
                    Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything special happening in AID at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Change of administrators which always represents a major change in the
                    agency in terms of how things are done, new policies. Different emphasis on
                    programs. And it probably affected people more in the field than it did in
                    Washington. Policies are made in Washington but the real implementation is out
                    in the field. And if it is not conveyed properly to the field, people are in the
                    dark in terms of how they should be doing things if Washington already has
                    decided how they would like to have it implemented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your experience were they effective in communicating
                        these changes?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes and no. In certain areas I think they have probably been very
                    effective. In other areas, not so good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do any examples come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Not right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you continued with the foreign disaster
                        assistance...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assigned to the USAID/Philippines Desk - 1978</p>
                <p>RYBAK: Until 1978. Again, if you look at my career, it usually goes in two to
                    three year periods. We just talked about 1976-1978. We are now talking
                    1978-1981. I had heard they were looking for an assistant desk officer on the
                    Indonesia desk. I didn't know whthe desk officer was but I found out and
                    arranged to have an interview with that person.</p>
                <p>Interviews are very interesting because you can find out so much information. I
                    actually was interested in an assistant desk officer position in the
                    Philippines. Inadvertently the Indonesian desk officer told me there was an
                    opening on the Philippine desk. So I went back to my office in foreign disaster
                    assistance and looked up who the desk officer was for the Philippines. I
                    contacted this person and, lo and behold, his assistant was going to be leaving
                    within a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you interested in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was interested in the Philippines because of my six year tour in Vietnam
                    and also the fact that I had met my wife, who is Filipino, in Vietnam. It would
                    give us the opportunity to go back to the islands on TDY (temporary duty)
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a possibility of going to the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: There was definitely a possibility of going to the Philippines on TDY
                    assignments. I brought the family with me on the TDY to the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the nature of the TDY assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: TDY assignments were necessary to follow up on the projects that I was
                    responsible for back-stopping in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Q: So you became the desk officer?</p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was the assistant desk officer on the Philippine desk. Peter Cody was
                    the mission Director at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your job was to go on TDY's to the Philippines...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: TDYs were difficult to get. The thing is that money was always a problem
                    in AID/Washington getting people out to the missions. And I would sometimes
                    observe that the wrong people got to go. The job was to be an advocate in
                    AID/Washington for the projects the Mission in the Philippines was implementing.
                    Additionally, the job entailed completion of program documents like the
                    Congressional Presentation done each year, participate in project reviews,
                    prepare papers on issues for symposia with the World Bank, the International
                    Monetary Fund (IMF), etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Simply because people who were back-stopping the programs following the
                    day to day progress or lack thereof, of programs were the ones that were at the
                    bottom of the totem pole money wise. The higher-ups...the people in the
                    hierarchy that were above you were the ones that normally got to go. I only made
                    one trip to the Philippines. And I think it would have been beneficial if we
                    could have made trips at least once every six months. I made one during the time
                    I was there. It was a good trip because I was able to meet the people out there
                    I was back-stopping by telephone. And I got to meet them personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the conditions in the Philippines in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The Philippines was a very large program. It was under President Marcos
                    and his regime. It was a multi-million dollar program AID was supporting over a
                    hundred million dollar program. Projects included every aspect of development.
                    The Philippines was also like a proving ground because so much money was going
                    into that country. And hopefully we profited both ways. From those projects that
                    failed and those that succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back at that experience and looking at the
                        situation in the Philippines today, do you think that things that you were
                        doing then had an impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>RYBAK: I think many of the projects that AID was supporting had an impact.
                    Particularly in the agriculture and health fields. And I think the reason is we
                    had AID officers actually assigned outside the capital in areas in the
                    Philippines where they lived day to day and were closer to the problems than
                    people who resided and worked in Manila. It makes a big difference whether you
                    have people in the field or people who are able to cover a particular area and
                    be responsible for that area and work with the people to develop the area than
                    having people just occasionally going once in a while from the capital out on a
                    field trip.</p>
                <p>I know this goes back to my Peace Corps experience and at this point I'd like to
                    make a distinction if you would between economists in the agency and the Peace
                    Corps ex-Volunteers working at AID. We had over 500 ex-Peace Corps volunteers
                    who joined AID. They also hired a lot of economists out of college. And you get
                    into this thing about theory vs practicality. Pragmatic vs theory of economics.
                    When you are talking about rural areas, theory is fine in its place. But people
                    in the village don't understand theory. They understand the pragmatic aspects of
                    getting drinking water or wells or better drainage or better housing. Things
                    that touch them personally. Perhaps this debate will go on forever and never be
                    resolved. Who accomplishes more in Third World countries - economists with their
                    unproven theories or trained and experienced urban and rural development
                    specialists who get down to the grassroots level of society.</p>
                <p>And I had discussions with people in the agency who were of the opinion the
                    economists are the ones who really make things happen. I took the contrary
                    position that, I believe many of the ex-Peace Corps Volunteers became real
                    implementers of AID projects. They wanted to get something done. I observed
                    economic theoretical programs imposed on countries like Senegal and The Gambia
                    that are still being judged whether or not they really helped those countries in
                    the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are two ends of the continuum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: They are two ends of the continuum and I guess the debate is still going
                    on. I was termed a “do-gooder,” whereas the economists with their high falutin
                    theories, even though much of that theory when it was put in practice, did not
                    work out as well as expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what lesson did you learn from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Perhaps you need a combination of both. That you have to mellow and adjust
                    the applied economics to the country and the situation existing in that country.
                    That what a Ph.D. graduate feels should be done isn't exactly the same way they
                    look at it in Sudan, Mali, Senegal, or somewhere else. We must take the
                    country's situation into consideration when planning and implementing projects
                    and programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this contest between the theorists and the
                        do-ers is still prevalent within the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I don't think it's as prevalent as it used to be. When I worked in the
                    Africa Bureau, I had closer contact with the economists. It was sometimes
                    appalling to see what they were trying to impose as economic conditionality on
                    some of the countries. In this case it was Senegal and The Gambia. It was very
                    stringent but it was almost like transporting what we do here in the United
                    States and saying these countries must do it the same way. I disagreed with that
                    approach. I think it has to be adapted and adjusted to those countries, to the
                    culture, and to the conditions that exist in those country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along these lines, do you have a personal theory of
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: My personal theory of development is the grassroots concept works. But not
                    everyone wants to work at the grassroots level. AID has been in and out of this.
                    We have had people assigned beyond the capitals of Third World countries, but in
                    most cases our AID people are assigned in the capitals. They live in the big
                    city and work out of the AID building in the capital and they go to the field on
                    their observation trips. I really believe if you are going to get some
                    development going beyond the capital in the countryside, the advisors have to be
                    out in those areas. One must live and work with the people in order to build
                    rapport and confidence, something that does not happen overnight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of programs did you work on in the
                        Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In the Philippines I didn't have the agricultural portfolio. I did have
                    the health, education, family planning, rural development, and other social
                    programs. I handled that part of the overall portfolio. It was just too large a
                    program to have one assistant. Therefore, two assistants worked with the desk
                    officer for the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was in 1978 until...</hi>

                <p>Transfer to Desk Officer for the South Pacific - 1981</p>
                <p>RYBAK: Until 1981. And it was then on to another challenging assignment. After
                    the Philippines, I became desk officer for the South Pacific, ASEAN (Association
                    of Southeast Asian Nations) and the residual AID program in South Korea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What countries did that include?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: All the newly independent countries of the South Pacific in Polynesia and
                    Melanesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu (New Hebrides), many
                    of the island groups, but not the Cook Islands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can fill them in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Okay. But all these little island republics were becoming newly
                    independent. My assignment as desk officer was South Pacific, the residual South
                    Korean program, and ASEAN. Backstopping Bill Paupe in Korea; Don Melville in the
                    Philippines; and Bob Craig in Fiji. I was backstopping three people at the same
                    time in different parts of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a program money wise was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The South Pacific program was not that large. The ASEAN program was
                    larger. It was something being promoted in Asia. AID wanted at least one project
                    in each one of the ASEAN member countries. We felt it was important enough to
                    have a person in Manila to coordinate the assistance going into each country.
                    The member countries of ASEAN were The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
                    Indonesia, and Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the overall objective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: ASEAN is an international organization formed by the above-mentioned
                    countries for the purpose of accelerating economic, social, and cultural
                    progress and ensuring the stability of the Southeast Asian region. It was
                    established in 1967. The objective was, at least at the time I was involved, was
                    to have one project in each of the member countries. To show those countries as
                    a coordinated group they had U.S. support and we would provide funding for
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RYBAK: I think it was very successful because we helped to strengthen ASEAN. It
                    is still an on-going Asian membership and Myanmar (formerly Burma) became a
                    member. They do a lot on their own without outside assistance. I think we were
                    planting the seeds by promoting and funding projects. We were instrumental in
                    getting the organization moving actively, getting the people from each member
                    country to talk to each other, showing we were serious about getting projects
                    going in each country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it had a developmental effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Oh, very definitely. I think a lot of what you see now in progress-quote
                    progress-in those countries...the reason I say, quote progress is because we saw
                    Indonesia take off beyond anyone's dreams. We saw Thailand take off. Philippines
                    is bustling. Korea was not a member of ASEAN. They had a situation where AID had
                    a program for 33 years. I was part of the AID group that helped to phase our
                    program out of South Korea. In the other ASEAN countries, I think, very
                    definitely there was a developmental effect. We helped pull ASEAN together and
                    realized if they (the member countries) were going to succeed in this area of
                    industrialization, increased employment, and trade, they would have to pull
                    together. I'm not saying that ASEAN did it on its own but we were certainly
                    instrumental in helping those countries do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you say ASEAN continues today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Absolutely and the Republic of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has also become a
                    member. Vietnam was supposed to become a member also, but I am not sure it has
                    occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by now I suspect that you are feeling that you want to
                        move again...two years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: How did you guess? Absolutely. Every two or three years. Now we are in the
                    period of June 1981-June 1985. I was sitting contentedly on the South
                    Pacific/ASEAN desk. I was hopeful an overseas assignment would come either to
                    the Philippines or another country in Asia. That assignment was not
                    forthcoming.</p>
                <p>Returned overseas to USAID/Jamaica as the Private Sector Officer - 1985</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One day I was approached on the telephone by someone named Glenn Patterson. He
                    introduced himself as the AID Mission Director to Jamaica and asked if I would
                    be interested in talking to him about a position in Jamaica as a private sector
                    officer. I have always known better than to spite myself even though I had
                    ambitions of going to Asia on assignment. I told Mr. Patterson I would be happy
                    to talk to him about an assignment to Jamaica. And we did. He explained the
                    situation in Jamaica. With President Reagan committing the U.S. to the Carribean
                    Basin Initiative (CBI) and to Prime Minister Seaga of Jamaica in particular, Mr.
                    Patterson was developing a private sector initiative early in the game.</p>
                <p>He told me he was proposing I come down to AID/Jamaica as his private sector
                    officer. At that time, Patterson had the foresight to realize that AID's
                    emphasis was going to be increasingly on the private sector. And the Caribbean
                    Basin Initiative, which he knew was coming down the pike and Prime Minister
                    Seaga of Jamaica was to be instrumental in playing a major role. Seaga actually
                    came to the U.S. and talked to Reagan about the regional private sector
                    initiative about to occur in the Caribbean.</p>
                <p>Patterson had the foresight to see what was happening and decided he would get
                    the USAID/Jamaica Mission involved in the private sector. Therefore, he asked me
                    to consider going to Jamaica as the private sector officer in the USAID mission.
                    I agreed to go take this assignment with little or no training in private sector
                    development. But I realized in AID as in so many things I had done in the past,
                    where I didn't necessarily have the specific training, one can take the job and
                    learn as much as possible about the job so you can function well in the job. I
                    always took an assignment with AID with the objective I would become an expert
                    and do the best job possible in each position held. That is one of the reasons I
                    feel that I had such a wonderful, diverse career with AID.</p>
                <p>Many people hesitate to take jobs because they don't have the background. They
                    don't realize they have experiences which can qualify one for positions.
                    Experiences can't take the place of a master's degree or a Ph.D. If one knows
                    the ropes of how to operate within the parameters of the agency, then one should
                    be more than willing to take on an assignment and accept it as a challenge. One
                    can learn as much about that position as one can and function well.</p>
                <p>In Jamaica, we were providing funding to more than one hundred private sector
                    consultants (these were American and Jamaican consultants) to implement private
                    sector activities in the country. For example, Jamaica was trying to market its
                    products in the U.S. and elsewhere. Those products must literally jump off the
                    shelf so the consumer will want to try it. However, the labeling on Jamaican
                    products at that time was not very sophisticated and the outside packaging was
                    poorly done.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So I arranged to contract with a very sophisticated advertising firm in New York
                    City; I brought an expert to work with the Jamaicans to improve their product
                    labeling. This man was a labeling expert. Because Jamaica had some very decent
                    products, the labeling expert felt with better labeling, the Jamaicans would be
                    able to export those products to the United States and elsewhere. They also
                    would have better opportunities to sell their products with better labeling. AID
                    funding was also used to support the Kingston Export Free Zone, Small Business
                    Association, Jamaican Investment Group, and a host of other individuals and
                    groups working in the private sector.</p>
                <p>I would recommend this project I was responsible for conducting in Jamaica be
                    done in every AID country where we are trying to develop the private sector. It
                    was called the Technical Consultations and Training Grant. In Washington, they
                    termed the project a boondoggle. But without such a grant funding to , we would
                    never have made the strides we were enabled to do with the private sector in
                    Jamaica. This grant project was started with a few million dollars. It gave us
                    immediate access to funding to contract for consultants and services directly
                    from Jamaica without having to go through approval in Washington. It gave us a
                    great deal of flexibility to accomplish activities and promote private sector
                    projects without Washington putting in their two cents, which often was the
                    reason for the demise of some very good overseas projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were your customers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Customers were basically Jamaicans. It was all part of the Caribbean Basin
                    Initiative. It was where you saw a need the Jamaicans couldn't fulfill
                    themselves that we would bring an expert in to their system - basically business
                    people to assist the Jamaican private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Big ones, small ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Large and small. But the whole idea of the grant was to give us
                    flexibility in approving these $20,000-$2 million projects immediately. We did
                    not have to go through the Washington bureaucracy for approval on evaluation of
                    the effectiveness of the projects. But as it became known that we had this
                    special grant, Washington started calling it a boondoggle. And we had to prove
                    to Washington it was being used for worthwhile activities within the mandates
                    AID had set for us to develop a country's private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are now in Jamaica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: This was in Jamaica, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were physically located in Jamaica.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was physically located in Jamaica with my family. When this project was
                    initiated before I got there, not one single project had been implemented. The
                    project was taken away from another officer and given to me by the Mission
                    Director. Within one month, and this is not to brag about my capabilities or
                    anything, but within one month we had at least ten of the fifteen projects
                    already underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: By contacting the people who were to be involved in the projects. There
                    was already a list of some projects Jamaicans wanted to do which had not been
                    accomplished yet. It required a lot of initiative to get out to see these
                    people, to talk with them and find out what they needed. Since I had direct
                    access to the Mission Director, I would discuss the project with him, whether or
                    not we could do them. They had been sort of pre-approved by AID prior to making
                    the contact but needed an implementor. AID needed somebody to get the job
                    done.</p>
                <p>When the person from whom I took his job came back from a trip to London one
                    month later, he was flabbergasted I was able to get as much started as we did.
                    And I am talking about all sorts of initiatives with a small business
                    association, business groups that we worked with and through to promote projects
                    in the private sector. Some of them were almost “Mom and Pop” type projects.
                    People who had projects in their backyards. Maybe they needed a little extra
                    money to boost their production, to buy some resources, tools perhaps to make
                    their project grow. They usually had five or six people working for them. These
                    were fantastic opportunities for private entrepreneurs and it was great fun to
                    have a job where I touched the lives of so many people to make their lives
                    better.</p>
                <p>We did some work with the Kingston Export Free zone. I would like to visit
                    Jamaica to see if some of those businesses are still functioning. We also were
                    trying to attract U.S. businesses to Jamaica. The Jamaica Exporters Association
                    was another group that we worked with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Patterson was the director then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did he feel about this approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RYBAK: It was due to the initiative of Mr. Patterson and the foresight to get
                    this project initiated that made it easy for me to actually implement and build
                    on it. By the time I left Jamaica four years later, the project had grown to a
                    $20 million dollar program and was being replicated in other AID countries. I
                    earned a promotion during the years I implemented this series of projects which
                    brought me up to the FS-1 level.</p>
                <p>The focus changed a little bit with the change of directors. After Patterson came
                    Lou Reed. Reed came from the private sector and the independence I felt we had
                    with Mr. Patterson was not there when Mr. Reed arrived. He took a much more
                    direct role himself rather than let the officers, myself and others implement
                    the projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say the major accomplishment of this
                        activity was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was to put funding where our mouth was. It was basically to tell the
                    Jamaicans we would check to see if we could do something and we did. If we found
                    we could do it we did. If we were unable to utilize the money because of
                    stringencies in the AID regulations, we would tell them we could not do it. But
                    we would try to find other ways of getting around it, particularly if the
                    Jamaicans came up with good concepts for projects. My counterpart on the
                    Jamaican Government side was a wonderful person by the name of Corinne McLarty,
                    Prime Minister Seaga's choice to head up his private sector and investment
                    initiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point you are about 20 years into your development
                        experience...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...if you go back with the Peace Corps as the beginning.
                        What are some of the changes that have occurred to you and to development
                        over this period? Anything that comes to you at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: We touched on it during our discussion. Development became more
                    sophisticated as I went along in my career. Maybe too sophisticated. We were
                    going over and beyond in not staying and buildinmore at the grassroots level
                    with the people who really needed the assistance - the urban and rural poor. We
                    generalized and what was good for one country was good for any country. Each
                    country is different. I think we tended to forget that very important concept as
                    we proceeded down the development road.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I believe we have to work with development uniquely in each country. We can use
                    many of the ideas and concepts that succeeded in other countries and apply them
                    to a country but not exactly in the same way. I am afraid that sometimes AID
                    made the mistake of trying to apply a program in exactly the same way because it
                    was successful in one country it would work exactly the same way in another
                    country. Nothing works exactly the same in another country. Each country is
                    different.</p>
                <p>

                <p>RYBAK: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that reflected in the attitude of the director?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I am ambivalent. I would say maybe some of it worked but certainly if it
                    didn't we should have dumped it quickly...rather than let it linger on the way
                    we did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were some good ideas that may have
                        applicability?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Absolutely. Even if there were some things that were bad there was still
                    some good to come out of it. It may take a little longer with AID though. We can
                    always profit from our mistakes. It just seemed to take longer for AID to
                    understand that concept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1985 what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Back in USAID/Washington in the Africa Bureau - 1985</p>
                <p>RYBAK: Okay. What was going on? There was more emphasis on Africa. When I came
                    back from Jamaica-well, even before I left Jamaica-I knew I was going to be
                    assigned as program officer back-stopping Senegal, The Gambia, and I would have
                    another assistant desk officer working for me who would backstop AID's program
                    in Mali.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>This was very interesting in terms of personalities because years ago on the
                    Philippine desk, I had just missed the famous-maybe infamous-Sarah Jane
                    Littlefield. She had worked in the Asia Bureau before she was assigned as a
                    Deputy Director in Indonesia. I had never met Sarah Jane Littlefield. When I
                    left Jamaica and was going back to a Washington assignment, I realized I was
                    going to be back-stopping Sarah Jane Littlefield, who was the Mission Director
                    in Senegal at the time. And she was one of the most marvelous Mission Directors
                    I can ever recall meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it about her that made her distinguished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The thing that distinguished her was her realistic approaches to
                    development. Building on her own experience-and she had a wonderful past
                    experience and incidently was one of the women who rose up through the ranks
                    step-by-step before the women's liberation movement really started. She did it
                    before the women's liberation movement got started. I mean, you would have to
                    take your hat off to her just for that reason alone, she rose through the ranks
                    and she did it at AID prior to any of this movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her theory of development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I believe Sarah Jane's theory of development was basically to build on the
                    projects, programs, activities which in her experience had worked in other
                    countries. And to adapt and adjust those successes to the country where she was
                    working. It seems to me she was forever citing projects she was responsible for
                    in other countries. She was willing to adapt to the country - in this case,
                    Senegal.</p>
                <p>That was a big program at the time, the Senegal and The Gambia programs. I also
                    got a four week TDY to Senegal and The Gambia. Sarah Jane was a real human
                    being. I mean, there was a lot of hoopla built up about Sarah Jane - oh, my God!
                    - because everyone in the agency knew her. I found her to be a delightful
                    person. It was wonderful to back-stop her. It created a little bit of a problem
                    for me personally which I will mention because I think it is important for other
                    people who may have had a similar experience or may encounter this problem
                    during their careers.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Sarah Jane considered me part of the AID mission-even though I was based in
                    Washington. I knew her program so well. I was her defender as the desk officer.
                    I had to defend her programs and activities. She and I were on the phone I would
                    say at least four or five times a week talking about particular projects, the
                    missions' position on those projects and the advocacy role they wanted me to
                    demonstrate in the meetings with the Africa Bureau administrator and others. I
                    think I played the role very well and she knew it. She told me, “Dave is an
                    honorary member of my mission. I am making Dave an honorary member of my mission
                    even though he is in Washington.” I felt good someone appreciated my work so
                    much.</p>
                <p>Dennis Chandler was the director of the Sahel-West Africa program, Phyllis
                    Dichter succeeded Chandler. In my annual evaluation, I was not in her estimation
                    (Dichter) performing the role of a desk officer appropriately. I was doing too
                    effective a job of backstopping Senegal. Too much on the mission side, and not
                    Washington's. However, I was getting all sorts of plaudits from the U.S.
                    ambassador in Senegal and the Mission Director about the job I was doing. The
                    Senegal Mission was engaged in some major policy reform in Senegal at the time
                    and the U.S. ambassador played a major role in the reforms. He took more
                    interest in the AID program than most U.S. ambassadors, because he liked
                    AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were caught between a rock and a hard place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was caught between a rock and a hard place on that one. Again, if you
                    look at the record I was the program officer from September, 1985 through
                    November, 1987. And it was time again for a change.</p>
                <p>Special assignment with the National Year of the Americas - 1987</p>
                <p>And this change isn't on my official resume. But I made a note of it here I was
                    being beckoned by the Deputy Administrator of AID and his assistant to take a
                    job which was a very special position. It was the National Year of the
                    Americas-1987. Ronald Reagan was President. He was bestowing on Holly Coors of
                    the Coors Brewery Company an ambassadorship-a goodwill ambassadorship-for the
                    National Year of the Americas. The Pan-American Games were to take place in
                    Indianapolis. It was going to last for about seven months until the end of the
                    year. President Reagan signed a special decree officially establishing 1987 as
                    the National Year of the Americas to strengthen ties between the nations of the
                    Western Hemisphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>It was to celebrate the western hemisphere nations. That is, to celebrate the
                    regional commonalities and cultural differences between the countries of Latin
                    America, Canada and the United States. It was a year of special events in which
                    the major event was the Pan-American Games in Indianapolis. The special program
                    assistant to Ambassador Coors was to ensure she was successful in her role as
                    ambassador and to implement projects in a very short time. That is a short
                    time-frame by AID standards-six months.</p>
                <p>The reason they needed an AID person on the ambassador's staff was to plan and
                    program half a million dollars in assistance provided by the Bureau for Latin
                    America. And we planned projects that could be implemented within a few
                    months.</p>
                <p>One of the projects we planned was to bring two children from each of the Latin
                    American countries to the US to participate in a special one week program
                    conducted by the Department of Agriculture for 4-H youngsters in the United
                    States. The Latin American equivalent was 4-C and these youngsters came to
                    Washington for this segment of the two to three week program. After they
                    completed the one week training in Washington, we sent them to Indianapolis to
                    watch a day or two of the Pan-American games. We also had the youngsters attend
                    the annual State Fair to observe how 4-H-ers in this country exhibit their
                    animals, crafts, vegetables and participate in judging events.</p>
                <p>We had to be very careful how we budgeted the money. I had to appear on the Hill
                    in the chambers of the House and Senate representatives responsible for the
                    foreign assistance program. They were very dubious about the entire National
                    Year of the Americas and the fact President Reagan had appointed a Republican to
                    the position. They felt this was partisan politics. Therefore, they were viewing
                    this program with a very skeptical eye and it was the Democrats who were
                    critical since at that time they controlled both chambers of the Congress.</p>
                <p>I went before the Senator responsible for the foreign assistance program and had
                    to justify why we were doing this program, why I had been assigned to the
                    program and why half a million dollars had been assigned for the project. We
                    were successful in getting the Congressmen to approve most of the projects but
                    they did turn down a few as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn from this experience that was different
                        than what you had done in the past?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In the past, I never had the opportunity to testify on the Hill and defend
                    one of AID's programs. I learned it requires compromise and accommodation on the
                    part of both parties; in this case, Congress and AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give some examples of this? Does anything come to
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes. We had presented to the Congress a portfolio of four or five projects
                    we felt were development projects. The Congressmen eliminated two of the
                    projects and were planning to reject the third project, which was the 4-H
                    program. Because Holly Coors was very well connected in government and political
                    circles, she contacted the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, the very
                    top position. As a result, it helped us to get Congress' approval to implement
                    this project within six months. We convinced the people on the Hill it was a
                    worthwhile project and would make a big impact in this country and the children
                    visiting from Latin American countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you were dealing with the political level of the
                        AID program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: That is correct. It was the political level for a very special program
                    that was only going to last seven months. Because of my position with Ambassador
                    Coors, it involved politics at high levels of Aid, the Congress, the White
                    House, and other departments of the U.S. Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did that program actually come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Actually I think the program came out very well. The USAID Deputy
                    Administrator called me into his office and explained I could literally have any
                    job within reason in AID. And it was sort of, if you will, a gold coin in my
                    pocket I could use at the time when I completed my job with Ambassador
                    Coors.</p>
                <p>I needed a break after working with Ambassador Coors and I needed time to think
                    about what I wanted to do next in my wonderful career. Someone pointed me in the
                    direction of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).
                    I interviewed with the deputy director and she was delighted I would take the
                    program officer position and have responsibility for organizing conferences in
                    the United States; to be exact, four conferences a year for small minority and
                    women-owned businesses.</p>
                <p>One must understand AID was prominently involved in promoting business and
                    investment abroad, an area that AID traditionally wasn't out front before. All
                    of a sudden, AID was very involved in private sector interests. I believe it was
                    during the Bush years when there was a major effort to increase support abroad
                    to enhance the private sectors of Third World nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I accepted the job in OSDBU and proceeded to take on full responsibility for
                    planning, organizing and implementing conferences in major U.S. cities. For the
                    length of time I was with OSDBU, about four years, I conducted 15 conferences in
                    major cities throughout the United States. San Francisco, Los Angeles, San
                    Diego, Houston, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, New York, Miami and Atlanta. I liked
                    the job because it allowed me to get away from Washington, to major cities of
                    our nation and learn each city well. Most of these cities were new to me. I
                    learned what resources were available in each city to coordinate with local
                    Chambers of Commerce, small business associations, minority business groups, and
                    others interested in promoting small business and minority business
                    contracting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you plan one of these conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: There is a lot of work that goes into a conference and unless you did one
                    you wouldn't really understand how well it has to be planned in order to make it
                    successful. In the office where I worked I didn't have anybody to assist me. I
                    was basically doing most of the work myself. And as a result it wasn't bad
                    because nobody else could screw it up except me. I had the format down so well,
                    where everything went according to a very precise schedule. A pre-site visit six
                    months before the conference was made to each of the sites where we intended to
                    conduct conferences for that year.</p>
                <p>I would go to the city for two or three days, sometimes as long as a week. I made
                    contacts with the small business administration people, departments of commerce,
                    minority business groups, ethnic groups working in business in those cities and
                    keeping them as my personal contacts in getting the word disseminated throughout
                    the city, informing them we would return in six months to conduct the one day
                    conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they receptive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In most cases people were very receptive to the idea AID was giving people
                    the opportunity to learn about our international agency and potential
                    opportunities that might exist for doing contracting or subcontracting with AID
                    and with larger firms.</p>
                <p>The small/minority business concern was would they all get contracts? The answer
                    was “No, of course we are not going to contract with everybody.” We are going to
                    contract or subcontract in those areas where AID normally needs special skills
                    and knowledge. Once they understood what AID does, they were very receptive to
                    the idea of AID conducting a conference in their city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they contribute to the conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RYBAK: What they contributed was the special speakers. We had to work out a
                    roster of speakers and we always invited the mayor or someone in his office who
                    might be responsible for small, minority business to participate in the
                    conferences. In many cases, the mayors themselves came. We would ask presidents
                    of business associations or Chambers of Commerce. We would schedule a spot on
                    the program for fifteen minutes where they would talk about their organization
                    and how they felt their organization could work with AID abroad or in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the outcome of these conferences relate to the
                        work that AID was doing in the developing countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Actually it related directly in terms of many of the 8(a) minority
                    contracts that were awarded to eligible businesses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 8(a)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: 8(a) is minority business contracting, a special legislative mandate by
                    the Congress. I'm not sure it is still functioning now, but it was a very active
                    program at the time I was working in that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective were the conferences in developing an
                        interest in 8(a)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I do not believe we ever had an unsuccessful conference. I was always able
                    to predict how many people would show up at each conference. I could make good
                    predictions because of the close work I did in following up after the pre-sites
                    with the host city officials and the people in Washington for the major
                    organizations like the Small Business Administration, Minority Business
                    Development Agency, Commerce Department, the Import/Export banks, and other
                    organizations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aside from being offered any job you wanted to have, did
                        you get any other kind of recognition from AID for this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: You mean for the small business job. No, not really. I never cashed in the
                    gold chip I had in my pocket from the previous assignment. If you mean did I get
                    a promotion for my work in small business, the answer is no. We did have a
                    proactive and dynamic director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>RYBAK: His name was John Wilkinson who was the special assistant to the Aid
                    Deputy Administrator. Since he was a minority person himself, he really believed
                    in the program. I'd like to mention at this point though before he came to the
                    office (I joined the staff in December 1987.), I was almost a year there without
                    the benefit of a director. I was working with the deputy director and with ten
                    or eleven other black African-American women. It was a unique experience because
                    I was the only white person in the office. I learned a lot from my work
                    experience in OSDBU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it effect you? What did you have to change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It didn't effect my work directly but I had to be careful what I said and
                    how I behaved in the office. Making sure I didn't offend anyone. The office
                    staff was very sensitive to the issues of ethnicity and especially race.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about gender?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Gender was also something where I had to be very careful. What you said
                    and how you said it. I became very sensitized to the staff around me since I was
                    the only white person on the staff until the director finally arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is basically four years of work in private sector
                        development.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was basically in small business development. And I liked it very much.
                    I liked it because it was tangible. I could see the results. When I did a
                    conference and I managed to get 150-200 participants, I knew I would hear from
                    many of the participants. They would come to Washington. They would ask for an
                    appointment to follow up to get on a roster. A roster that would give them
                    potential opportunities for contracting or subcontracting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the lessons that you learned as a Peace Corps
                        volunteer doing rural development, did any of those lessons apply in this
                        situation or were they helpful at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RYBAK: It was a people-oriented situation where you have to get along with
                    people. Not only the people I was working with in the office but particularly
                    the cooperation of people I was contacting in the cities. They were of all
                    racial backgrounds. I was talking to Asians, African-Americans, Hispanics,
                    Native Americans, etc. I was attending meetings in ghetto areas. I was traveling
                    throughout the cities and it required good people skills I felt I learned in the
                    Peace Corps. The Peace Corps experience and a wonderful family upbringing helped
                    me greatly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the management side? What skills did you
                        use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Management skills...you had to be a good planner, a good organizer. And
                    meet tight deadlines. Very tight deadlines. Things had to be done on schedule.
                    If I did not adhere to the schedule, I would get off-track quickly. I knew I was
                    working toward a goal - a conference on a particular date that had been locked
                    in six months before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you receive any particular training in funding and
                        management from US-AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: None whatsoever for the small/minority business job. In terms of planning
                    and implementing the conferences, no. The job needed to be done by someone who
                    would make it work, a doer, someone who could get the job done. I had
                    participated years before in AID's mid-level management training program in
                    Jamaica and I also participated in the Development Studies Program(DSP) in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything further to say about this experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was a very unusual assignment. It was, if you will, out of the
                    mainstream of a traditional program officer. I had an opportunity to participate
                    not only in the conferences themselves by organizing and implementing them, but
                    I also made hundreds of contacts in and around the Washington area. Seeking out
                    private organizations interested in AID's type of work and informing about
                    potential opportunities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What came up next?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>RYBAK: What happened was a change of directorship at the Office of Small and
                    Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU). And a change in the budget. In the
                    early years when I joined OSDBU, we had the budget to fund four conferences a
                    year. As we went along, the budget was cut and we went from four conferences to
                    three. When I left OSDBU, we were down to two. Right now, I don't think the
                    OSDBU is doing any conferences. If they are being done, they are not at this
                    time being done at that office. They are being done somewhere else in the
                    agency. But, I did learn after my retirement that the conferences were being
                    done again at OSDBU.</p>
                <p>Concerning me, a new office was being established under the AID Administrator. He
                    was from Ohio, I believe. This office had not been launched yet. It was the
                    Center for Trade and Investment Services (CTIS), almost a perfect transition for
                    someone like myself who had been working with small and minority business
                    development to move into an area much broader, which was business development
                    and investment in general.</p>
                <p>Assisted in creating the Center for Trade and Investment - 1992</p>
                <p>Based on an AID report recommending a Center for Trade and Investment Services to
                    coordinate and to educate the private sector in opportunities abroad, I was
                    brought in to help establish the office. AID cooperated with the Department of
                    Commerce, the Import-Export Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary
                    Fund, and a host of other organizations. CTIS staffers would help private sector
                    business firms interested in doing business abroad. I moved to that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were you working for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: At that time the director of the program was Michael Hacker and it was in
                    the Bureau for Global Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: My position was senior business advisor. I was given a specific portfolio
                    of countries-more like regions if you would-I was given Russia and the New
                    Independent States and was also responsible for Eastern Europe, Latin America,
                    and Africa. But because of my background and the fact I was interested in
                    Russia, the Ukraine, and the New Independent States they had me focus
                    specifically on those areas and Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a program was it money-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>RYBAK: Money-wise it was not a large budget. As I recall, we had a few million
                    dollars in the budget which was supplemented as we went along. It was under five
                    million dollars overall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of activities did you fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: We didn't fund activities. We provided information. It was an information
                    center for the business community. We had facilities set up within the center
                    where we could meet businesspeople and talk to them about AID, the Agency's
                    goals, foreign assistance, and potential opportunities that might exist for
                    them-either with the Agency or with another department of the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that a very busy activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: We started out slowly. We launched the Center with the AID Administrator
                    cutting the ribbon. It grew quickly. One of the neat things about the office was
                    a specialized computer system. Every serious investor or business person, i.e. a
                    person who was interested in an import-export business, a person interested in
                    investment in a country, a person who wanted to develop a business in
                    partnership with a local business person in a particular country, etc. was
                    entered into the computer database for future reference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:...market for services at the center? How did you get
                        people interested and knowledgeable about what you could provide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The first thing was to get people knowledgeable within the Agency to what
                    the Center for Trade and Investment Services was. A lot of people within the
                    Agency didn't necessarily have a business orientation and were accustomed to
                    developing traditional projects with AID funding. They weren't oriented toward
                    promotion of private business and investment.</p>
                <p>We went to various AID offices to brief them on the Center. We did this with each
                    AID Bureau. After we briefed the Agency Bureaus about the Center, we went
                    outside AID to the Department of Commerce, the Import/Export Bank, the World
                    Bank, the Small Business Administration, etc. We made contact with those people
                    because we were also utilizing their information systems, as well as the
                    information we were accumulating within AID. We used the information from the
                    World Bank, the Department of Commerce, the Small Business Administration, and a
                    host of other organizations including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                <p>We sought out those people and made contacts staying in touch with them to
                    continue the dialogue between the Center for Trade and Investment Services and
                    each of the groups in the Washington area.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the follow-up? Once they came and got the
                        information, what happened after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: In many cases it was the difficult part of the program. Often times we
                    never knew whether a partnership actually reached fruition. We knew people were
                    traveling abroad with the information we gave them but at that time we didn't
                    have their feedback to inform us whether or not they had made an investment,
                    whether or not they had established a business overseas, or other transactions
                    they might have made overseas. I believe this information may now be in the
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you working in this center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I worked in the center from September, 1992 to February, 1995. One of the
                    things I wanted to mention about the program was the computer system. We had a
                    system whereby we could record every serious investor. We had their names, the
                    name of the business firm, the location in the United States, the business
                    interest of the firm since oftentimes we needed to follow up on what the
                    business wanted to do and someone else on the staff might have to handle the
                    case. If we wanted to know who talked to that person recently, we could access
                    the system and would know what the current situation was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this program ever evaluated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was evaluated after my departure from the office. And I am certain it
                    was a positive evaluation since the Center continues to function within AID's
                    Global Affairs Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for approximately three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK:Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those three years did you see much change in the
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I saw the program evolve from an idea to a viable program as we went
                    along. We became a finely-tuned information center, so much so that it is part
                    of the AID information program in the Reagan Building.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you feel about this particular assignment? Was it
                        satisfying to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Named to the USAID/Office of Information Resources Management (IRM) - 1995</p>
                <p>RYBAK: It was very satisfying. And your next question should be, “Why did I
                    move?” Because I had been in CTIS three years, I had pretty much done what I had
                    accepted the job to do. I was getting restless. Therefore, I decided I wanted to
                    finish my career in a different area. At that time, AID's IRM office was looking
                    for someone-an ombudsman, one of two-in the Office of Information Resources
                    Management. I interviewed with the director and the deputy director at lunch and
                    was overwhelmingly accepted for the job.</p>
                <p>This was a very interesting assignment because the Office of Information Resource
                    Management is responsible for all of the computer operations in AID. At that
                    time, under the leadership of Larry Byrne, there was an intensive effort to
                    implement new computer management systems. A multi-million dollar program that
                    would effect the entire AID operation in Washington and its Missions
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What specifically were your duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: As an ombudsman I was a trouble-shooter. My job was to answer any
                    inquiries from the field or within Washington and to deal with any computer
                    problems people were having. I was not a computer technician. But I would get
                    the technicians to focus on problems and help AID employees solve those
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in between the computer technicians and the
                        users?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I was the go-between to tactfully calm the persons when their computer
                    suddenly crashed. Usually they were very angry and I would ameliorate the
                    situation by informing them we would get help for them and they would correct
                    the situation. We were truly providing customer service to our AID colleagues in
                    Washington and our AID Missions overseas.</p>
                <p>A lot of what we did was facilitating AID employee problems with computer
                    hardware and software. We also planned and implemented events designed to
                    improve IRM staff teamwork and Total Quality Management (TQM). Total Quality
                    Management is an interesting concept and the private sector has been doing it
                    for a number of years. Total Quality Management did not get approved at the
                    higher levels of AID. I am referring to the Larry Byrne level. He felt AID was
                    not ready for TQM, yet AID was working on a mega-million dollar computer system
                    which was to be part of the New Management Systems in the Clinton administration
                    and was termed by one individual in the agency as a financial boondoggle. This
                    makes the Defense Department's $500.00 toilet seats scandal a few years ago look
                    tame by comparison.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>The computerized system was also termed the “black hole” because we were sinking
                    almost a hundred million dollars into a system that wasn't working. And it
                    wasn't working because it hadn't been properly tested.</p>
                <p>The whole idea was that an officer in the field working on a project would have
                    the very same information an officer in Washington monitoring the project would
                    have. One has to understand when you mention the fact it was just a little under
                    a hundred million dollars to develop this system. There were big AID contracts
                    going to high tech firms in the Washington area and elsewhere. These firms
                    supposedly knew what they were doing. On the other hand, there was a lot of
                    pressure by Larry Byrne to implement “his” program as quickly as possible. Many
                    of us felt Byrne had a Napoleonic complex, this short guy who walked into the
                    Agency as a political appointee and acted like he owned the AID establishment.
                    He was lucky to leave AID before being prosecuted for creating a “white
                    elephant” at AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The year was 1995 and if my memory serves me correctly, Byrne frequently
                    referred to “his” project as a train leaving the station on September 1, 1995.
                    The train was the New Management Systems. Larry Byrne stated everyone will be on
                    his train. As Ombudsman and knowing just how bad the situation was, even though
                    a lot of people were saying everything was on track and was going fine, one
                    couldn't help but feel this train was pulling out of the station on September
                    first but unfortunately there were no tracks! I would share my opinions with my
                    colleague, the other Ombudsman. I would tell him I was not on the locomotive or
                    in one of the cars. I was on the last steps of the caboose ready to jump off.
                    The engineer was Larry Byrne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the problems, particularly in the field,
                        that people were having with the New Management System?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: It wasn't something happening at the same time. It was pieces of the
                    system Washington felt were ready for implementation in the field. Because of
                    inadequate testing in Washington before taking it to the field, they were asking
                    the field to implement what hadn't been tested. As a result, it failed or did
                    not work.</p>
                <p>This was a real “black eye” on the face of AID because so much money was spent to
                    develop a very sophisticated system supposedly under Vice President Gore's New
                    Performance Initiative to make AID one of the model agencies in Washington to
                    implement such a program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has the New Management Systems been implemented yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>RYBAK: To my knowledge it has not been implemented but I believe it is in the
                    correctional stages so this beast is not a waste. I believe the techies are
                    trying to correct the systems to make them operational.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how do you feel about AID in terms of being a model
                        agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: With all the downsizing that has happened with personnel and budget
                    cutting, I do not believe AID has yet become a model for other agencies to
                    follow. I do not believe AID has been reinvented. We haven't reinvented
                    anything. It is the same old stuff in a different package, some of which has
                    been very costly and isn't working like it should.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Mainly because I believe the people who are the decision makers didn't
                    know what they were doing. They were imbued with some concepts they felt
                    strongly about and without being tested, charged ahead to get them started in
                    AID. Unfortunately, the people responsible for these “white elephants” left the
                    Agency. I understand Larry Byrne now heads up his own consulting firm. His wife,
                    Leslie Byrne, was recently elected Virginia State Senator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to your work with investment. Did you find the
                        work satisfying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Satisfying because I was helping people. I was assisting people. Helping
                    them to get their software and in many cases their hardware operating. But one
                    of the more rewarding parts of the assignment and you have to understand I went
                    to IRM in February of 1995. I trained supervisors and 80 staff employees on the
                    new employee performance evaluation system. I retired from the agency in January
                    1996. I attended the State Department's Career Transition Center (CTC) program
                    in September of 1995.</p>
                <p>Another new part of the re-invention was a new evaluation system. Employees had
                    to be educated on how the system worked because it was totally different from
                    anything we had before either the Civil Service or Foreign Service evaluation
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: You mean in terms of differences?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The old system did not pinpoint enough areas where employees were being
                    graded on leadership, monitoring capabilities, and accountability. The Foreign
                    Service evaluation was very general. It did not really give much detail and it
                    was rather long. The purpose of the new system was to simplify the form by
                    marking boxes rather than writing long paragraphs about a person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it more effective than the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I can't say it is more effective. I personally chose not to have the
                    evaluation under the new system because I knew I was leaving shortly. I can't
                    say how effective it has become, but I believe our training was effective in
                    letting people know what they were up against. Because the decision was made, I
                    feel AID probably is implementing the new evaluation system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In all the years and your experience with AID you have
                        been evaluated many, many times. And the evaluation system probably changed
                        once or twice. What do you think about the whole employee evaluation system?
                        Did it work properly? Did it give AID the full benefit of knowing what its
                        employees could do and can't do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The only way you are going to have a real objective evaluation is with the
                    participation of both the employee and the supervisor. By that I mean an
                    employee should be keeping a running record of what he or she has been doing.
                    Regular normal work is fine, the routine. But I am talking about special
                    assignments and projects assigned and any overtime or weekend work that one was
                    required to do. If one doesn't keep a record of work accomplished and let the
                    supervisor know about it, this needs to be acknowledged. Oftentimes, significant
                    accomplishments do not get included in the record.</p>
                <p>I believe in many cases the employee shortchanges himself/herself by not keeping
                    an on-going record of what they are doing, of what activities they are assigned
                    to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there an obligation on the supervisor's side to keep a
                        record also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Not necessarily if the supervisor isn't the one giving the assignment. If
                    it comes from two or three other sources sometimes the supervisor would not know
                    about it. That is why the employee needs to keep a record. He can tell the
                    supervisor what he has done. The supervisor's obligation would be to check with
                    those other people who had given the assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the personnel system does a good job in
                        moving people along properly in their career and giving training and placing
                        them in the organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: No. I have never felt the personnel system has taken the employee's wishes
                    or desires truly to heart. In many cases, and I am going back several years,
                    when I called on the personnel office, I wouldn't call on them often but I had
                    the impression I was bothering them. “What are you doing here?” And not very
                    helpful. That may have changed. I hope it has changed because personnel people
                    should be people oriented. They should be concerned about your concerns, your
                    problems, your skills and matching those experiences and skills with appropriate
                    jobs available. I never experienced much matching of skills in my career. I went
                    out to find the jobs myself without much assistance from personnel staff. I do
                    not know what other employees did to plan their assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the personnel people within the agency
                        professional and qualified to do the type of work you just mentioned? That
                        is a leading question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Qualified, if they were personnel people. But my impression is many of
                    these people were originally in clerical and/or secretarial fields and were
                    promoted into the personnel system without background or qualifications to be
                    personnel officers. As a result, they did the best they could under the
                    circumstances. If AID provided appropriate training and orientation for all
                    essential personnel officers, I believe the system would be much better. We have
                    many ex-secretaries and clerks in the personnel system functioning as personnel
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We digressed a little bit but I think it was appropriate.
                        Can we go back now to the ombudsman position and sum up on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Sure. I enjoyed the assignment and they wanted me to extend for another
                    year. AID would not allow it to happen because of my time in class (TIC). IRM
                    supervisors were rather disappointed when I mentioned to them I was retiring. I
                    did not want to retire but I was forced to retire. My TIC date was scheduled for
                    the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: TIC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Time in class. I technically had to leave the agency regardless of whether
                    or not IRM wanted me to stay. That was when I made my plans to attend the Career
                    Transition Center Program. In my case, it was a very interesting year because I
                    left AID's Information Resources Management Office in September. I attended the
                    one month training. The second month I practiced what they taught us at the
                    Transition Center Program. I went back to work and was caught in the shutdown of
                    AID as a result of not having a Continuing Resolution by the Congress</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A RIF (reduction in force)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Not a RIF. It was the federal government shutdown. It not only happened
                    once, it happened twice. I had every intention of returning to IRM (Information
                    Resource Management) to finish one month of work. I never made it. I only had
                    one week left after the two shutdowns. I went back for one week and it was time
                    to process out. The shutdown of government was still in effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was the end of your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: That was the end of my career. It was a strange way to end my career. But
                    that is the way it happened.</p>
                <p>Retirement and career transition</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you like to talk a few minutes about the career
                        transition process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes. In my opnion, the Career Transition Program is probably one of the
                    best programs offered by any government agency for retirees. The course gave the
                    proper orientation and procedures for someone who had to retire. Not only the
                    business about doing a resume properly and making sure it was done the right way
                    but all of the good pointers and suggestions made were very helpful, things that
                    one has to be especially aware of after retirement, such as keeping yourself in
                    good health. If you don't have your health, there's not very much you can do. No
                    matter if you retire with a hundred thousand dollar annuity, which most of us
                    don't do, the fact is without your health there is not really much you can do.
                    You must be healthy both in body and mind.</p>
                <p>I believe The Career Transition Center did an excellent job in orienting the
                    retirees. I believe the program is terrific. I would recommend anyone faced with
                    retirement to enroll in the program if they can.</p>

                <p>RYBAK: My transition... I tried all the techniques taught us. I was turned down
                    for some jobs. I was only pursuing jobs I was interested in. I did take to heart
                    what they said about looking back to your childhood or somewhere in your life on
                    things you might want to do. Because I was especially attracted to airports, I
                    took a part time job at Dulles International Airport.</p>
                <p>If my body and mind are sending me the right signals, I might be making a change.
                    However, I am a year and a half into the job and my two years is almost up! Time
                    for a change!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's sum up a little bit. Any regrets that you

                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I had a very diverse career with the agency. I've done so many different
                    things with AID and have learned every step of the way through experience and
                    training. My one regret is I did not have the opportunity-or felt that the
                    opportunity wasn't offered to me-of getting into the upper echelons of
                    management with AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: There was a period of time in the agency when we were top heavy with
                    senior Foreign Service officers and senior executive personnel. As a result,
                    there was no upward mobility within that upper echelon. As an FSR-1, logically
                    the next step would be Senior Foreign Service. I have seen people become senior
                    Foreign Service officers and have questioned, “Why?” But not having all the
                    facts available I really can't say.</p>
                <p>The fact is at one time we had constipation of the system. And it is my
                    term-constipation of the system. It was constipated at the top and as a result
                    of being constipated at the top, it was constipated at the levels below (FSRs) -
                    1s, 2s, 3s - it affected everyone. This happened because the system allowed
                    people who should have moved on or been moved on, to stay in their positions or
                    were extended beyond the time of their TIC dates. It was only when they began
                    enforcing TIC dates a few years ago, all of this constipation loosened up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you think now that the situation is better?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I think there might be more opportunities for people to get promoted from
                    FSR-1 to the senior level than before when I was looking to move upward.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other regrets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I want to mention a little more about the Senior Foreign Service. I had
                    done many things as a mid-level management officer and had been trained as a
                    mid-level manager. I felt AID was interested enough for me to be trained and I
                    could aspire to move into the upper echelons. Many of us became locked into the
                    system, so we were content to get in grade step increases to retire at the
                    highest grade possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Locked into middle management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Locked into middle management without ever having the opportunity to move
                    upward. Many of us did not have the opportunity to actually try management at a
                    higher level. We were never given that opportunity so there was no way of
                    knowing whether one would succeed or not. We knew mid-management needed
                    improvement. All it takes is a few good managers to make a real difference. I
                    have seen more of the bad side of management than I have the good side in
                    AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What of this re-engineering? Is that changing the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Call it re-engineering, call it re-inventing, I really don't think they
                    are re-inventing anything. What are we re-inventing? Are we re-inventing AID?
                    What does that really mean? I don't believe I ever understood what that term
                    meant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is supposed to mean that more power is given to
                        the people at the operational level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: That's nice to say. Those are words. But in practice is that really the
                    way it will operate? Will employees really be given a chance to participate and
                    to make decisions? Or will the supervisors just take good recommendations and
                    make themselves look good. Who gets the credit for that, the manager or the
                    people that are feeding into the system?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, re-engineering is supposed to eliminate extraneous
                        management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: You use the word “supposed.” We hope the system will work better. Having
                    seen so many different changes in AID in the past, I have to be a little bit
                    dubious about these terms now being used.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>There is another regret I would like to mention. This was a big disappointment
                    for me. When I worked in the Center for Trade and Investment Services I built up
                    a lot of information about Russia, the Ukraine and the other Independent States.
                    I expressed an interest at one time when the new Mission Director was assigned
                    to the Ukraine of working with the program there. The first Mission Director was
                    Terry McMahon. I told him I would be interested because of my Ukrainian
                    background and because I felt I could do a good job for him. Terry kept me in
                    mind.</p>
                <p>About six or eight months after he went to Ukraine, he sent a cable to Washington
                    inviting me to go there on a month and a half TDY. I was to check with the
                    appropriate desk officer for the Ukraine program and to get the preliminaries
                    going. On the other hand, I also had to let the people in the office where I was
                    working know of this opportunity that came my way. They were totally negative
                    and against my going to the Ukraine.</p>
                <p>Even though others on the staff had opportunities to go to Eastern Europe and
                    other places related to the job that we were doing at CTIS, I never went abroad
                    during the time I worked for them. This was a wonderful opportunity for me to
                    take the place of two people, a tandem couple who were coming to the U.S. on
                    home leave. I was to manage their projects until they returned to Ukraine.</p>
                <p>I wanted to do this special job. I was betrayed. I was betrayed by the Deputy
                    Administrator of the Bureau for Global Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't you use your “chip” from your friend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: The coin I'm afraid, had tarnished. When I had expressed to that
                    individual and my immediate supervisor my desire to go TDY to Ukraine, they were
                    very negative and told me I was urgently needed within the office. How come
                    other staff persons were able to make trips? It broke my heart because being
                    Ukrainian, and the fact that my cousin was the first ambassador to Ukraine, I
                    know I could have done a lot in the Ukraine - particularly the AID Mission - not
                    only the projects but recommendations I could have made to the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think that they didn't want you to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>RYBAK: Partly it was my supervisor. She had a direct hand in it. And the very
                    interesting thing is the betrayal came when I went above her to a person who was
                    a long time friend and also a colleague I had worked with for many years. He
                    originally said I could go to Ukraine. When my supervisor talked to him, he
                    reneged and followed her rather than my desire. He turned my TDY down. In other
                    words, he approved it and then turned it down. As a result, it destroyed our
                    friendship. We had been friends for a very long time and we still talk to each
                    other, but it is not like it was before. It was regrettable because I really
                    wanted to do the Ukraine assignment.</p>
                <p>Concluding observations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, now given your experience and given what you know
                        about AID today and where it is trying to go, do you have any kind of
                        recommendations that you would make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes. One of the big recommendations would be the fact that we are losing a
                    lot of talent...and have lost a lot of talent in the last five years as people
                    were forced into retirement.</p>
                <p>Some of these people, and I include myself, were at the productive peak of our
                    careers. We knew the Agency; we knew how to deal with the system. We knew how to
                    handle procedures and regulations and we also knew ways to expedite and get
                    around those rules and regulations but not break them. We knew how to stay
                    within the rules and regulations but still get the job done. Much of this is
                    based on accumulative experiences for 25, 30, 35 years of development work not
                    only in AID but in the Peace Corps and other international organizations.</p>
                <p>It is a crying shame for AID to be unaware of the talented people AID removed by
                    retirement and other means without having a program similar to what they have at
                    the State Department. The State Department has a program to hire retirees for
                    vacancies within State. I'm not talking about anything that would be permanent
                    employment. I'm not talking about a program whereby people come back and they
                    start another career with AID. I am talking about needs of the Agency. Places
                    where people with good skills and experience could be utilized if the agency so
                    desired.</p>
                <p>We pay private contractors to do much of this work. AID retirees could do many
                    jobs in Washington currently given to contractors to perform. Retirees could
                    also do special work that might be required at the AID overseas Missions. It
                    would make a lot more sense to let AID retirees do it. You don't have to hire
                    them at contractor salaries. I am certain retirees would be willing to do many
                    jobs because they are interested in international development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some would volunteer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>RYBAK: I am sure retirees would volunteer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are two things that they could do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Two things the retirees could do or AID could do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Retirees could do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Three things the retirees could do. You mean specifics like activities or
                    projects?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could they do training or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: Oh, absolutely. You could use retired AID people to do a variety of things
                    - jobs that need to be done. You could use them for in-house training. Many
                    retirees have had training experience. What I guess I am trying to say is
                    because retirees have had the experience - and I have had a very varied
                    experience - I am sure other people have had as much varied experiences or more
                    than I have. Retirees possess all kinds of talented capabilities. In order to
                    use those capabilities, AID should not lose touch with their retirees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are the retirees organized in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: There are some retired Foreign Service associations around but I believe
                    most of them are composed of State people. I am not sure AID is very active in
                    them. There are many retired AID people and it would probably be good if
                    something could be developed like an AID retirement association. AID might want
                    to focus on the concept together with AID retirees to discuss the possibility of
                    such an association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there are enough retired AID people to
                        support this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: I believe there are certainly enough AID retirees in the Washington area.
                    It might be a little difficult to bring people from outside the Maryland,
                    Virginia, and Washington, DC area. But even then I would venture to say there
                    are retirees living in Pennsylvania or other places who would be willing to
                    become members although they might not be able to be as active as people in this
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that AFSA could play a role in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>RYBAK: AFSA could be brought into it. Many of us are AFSA members. They should be
                    able to assist in organizing the association. If not, just to bounce the idea
                    off them and maybe see how they feel about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other recommendations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RYBAK: You know, after all of this interviewing I have to conclude I have had a
                    wonderful, interesting and diverse career with AID. Much of my career has been
                    through my own initiative and drive and also knowing where I wanted to be, then
                    making contacts with the people who might be able to help me get the job I
                    wanted. Oftentimes, people get disappointed. They get depressed because they
                    can't make it happen right away. Nothing happens right away, especially in AID.
                    And it may take a year. It may take 18 months. As long as you know where you are
                    and where you want to be working. That's half the battle.</p>
                <p>Q: Is there a lesson to be learned there for younger officers?</p>
                <p>RYBAK: Yes. The lesson would be to maintain your individuality. Know who you are.
                    Know where you are in AID in relation to others around you. Where do you want to
                    be? Take the necessary initiative to achieve your goals and objectives - your
                    career.</p>
