                    <hi rend="italics">Q: See how it goes. Okay, this is an oral history interview
                        with Jenonne Walker. It's the 26th of May, 2004. My name is Raymond Ewing.
                        This interview is being conducted under the Foreign Affairs Oral History
                        program sponsored by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.
                        Jenonne, it's good to have this conversation. I look forward to talking to
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: So do I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the place to begin is wherever you began in terms
                        of your involvement, your interest in Foreign Affairs. I guess I'd be
                        curious as to where you grew up, what kind of schooling you had and when you
                        came to Washington, assuming that's when you got started in foreign
                        relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WALKER: I'm a working class kid from a hick town in Oklahoma, and in that day, I
                    finished high school in 1952, it was quite easy to work one's way through the
                    University of Oklahoma. Nobody in my family had ever gone to the university or
                    to college. University of Oklahoma was almost scary at that time for us. It was
                    easy in part because the academic standards there were not terribly high, which
                    I didn't realize at the time. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven to be in a
                    place like that. There wasn't any career counseling for boys much less girls in
                    that day and none of the women I knew including myself thought in terms of a
                    career. We were all going to be wives and mothers. The few of us who didn't
                    marry right after college or during it got the most interesting job we could
                    find to support ourselves until we settled down. None of my close friends, I
                    don't think anyone I knew, really thought in terms of a career. I wanted to go
                    to school in Paris for the academic, intellectual/academic reasons an
                    all-American girl in the '50s wanted to dance with Gene Kelly. It's nothing more
                    serious than that. I applied for a scholarship, which I didn't get. So I went to
                    San Francisco, worked for a semester and saved some money and went second term
                    and I guess many people's lives are a series of accidents because mine certainly
                    is. I was going to come back to the States, got a place at Columbia University
                    to do further graduate work in European literature and philosophy. I had a
                    masters in philosophy from University of Oklahoma. What you do with a master's
                    in philosophy is further graduate work. I met an English man while going to
                    Paris. We got engaged. Instead of coming back to the States I went to London and
                    got a job. He and I promptly got unengaged but by that time I had fallen in love
                    with London and stayed there five years, with the kind of job that didn't
                    interfere with my social life, which is what mattered to me at the time. I was
                    hired as a secretary by the Naval attach�'s office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WALKER: At the embassy. I couldn't really do typing and shorthand, but I became
                    the visitors' bureau, party planner, that sort of thing. There was a little bit
                    of a clerical work as well. The only reason I left London was it got to be my
                    late twenties, and I was an old maid by that time in 1950s, early '60s and I
                    thought, you know I'm not getting married as soon as I thought I was going to.
                    I'd better get more serious about a job. So I came back to the States to go job
                    hunting. My major professor at the University of Oklahoma a man under whom I had
                    done my master's thesis in philosophy turned out to be a spotter for the CIA
                    (Central Intelligence Agency) and suggested that to me. Good God no, I thought,
                    because all I knew about the CIA was the Bay of Pigs and the U2. He said, “No,
                    no. They have this whole other organization that does analytical work. I think
                    you'd like it.” I didn't think so. So I went to New York and got a job at NBC
                    television news as a researcher with a unit doing documentaries and kept getting
                    letters from the CIA, which I didn't answer and the documentary unit was going
                    to fold about the time I got another letter from the agency saying you're not
                    answering our mail. If we don't hear from you by a date certain, we'll never
                    bother you again. I thought well, I'll try it for about six months. So I drifted
                    down to Washington and was undercover during the training program for six months
                    but I always intended to join the analytical side. I spent a dozen, I'd say a
                    dozen years at the agency, ten of those as an analyst of West European affairs
                    mostly in the office of National Estimates. It was a terrific education in how
                    to think and write about how people in other countries saw foreign policy
                    issues, but the time came when I wanted to say, “therefore, American foreign
                    policy should be”. Which the CIA of course should not do. It sometimes does and
                    shouldn't do. So much of life is a matter of accidents. Most of my accidents
                    were very lucky. When the Office of National Estimates was abolished at the
                    beginning of the second Nixon term, I became the assistant to the Director of
                    Central Intelligence, Bill Colby. Because he was from the spy side he wanted
                    somebody from the analytical side primarily to advise hion major analytical
                    papers. But at any rate because of my role with him, I was offered a chance to
                    go to the State Department on a two-year loan to the Policy Planning Staff then
                    run by Winston Lord in the Henry Kissinger days, which was a terrific
                    opportunity, and I was inherited by Tony Lake when he took over the Policy
                    Planning Staff after Carter's election and Vance became Secretary of State. My
                    two-year loan was not over and it was Tony who put me on the State Department
                    payroll rather than going back to CIA. My biggest regret is not having taken the
                    foreign service exam when I was young. But even if I had thought I was going to
                    have a career, I would not have done that because the Foreign Service were
                    people from Harvard and Yale, Princeton, not working class kids from the
                    University of Oklahoma. It was only after I got into it that I realized that I
                    was not a lot worse than other people in the Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So I got into the State Department as a civil servant and then as a charter
                    member of the Senior Executive Service. One of my unlucky breaks waI can't say
                    not taking the foreign service exam was an unlucky break that was my own wrong
                    decision. But one of my unlucky breaks was to come in on the State Department
                    payroll just as they abolished the Foreign Service Reserve because they had
                    planned the foreign service reform. So I was not able to enter the Foreign
                    Service on the class action suit which brought in Reg Bartholomew and Mike
                    Armacost and a good number of others who were Foreign Service Reserve. So for
                    the rest of my time in the state department I was limited in what I could do
                    because I was Civil Service rather than Foreign Service, and again I had very
                    lucky breaks. I had terrific jobs, but I was limited in the jobs that I could
                    have. I couldn't bid on jobs, and I couldn't work as I had wanted to in the
                    European Bureau. I could work in Policy Planning Staff. At the end of the Carter
                    years it was arranged that I would have what was then called an excursion tour
                    in the Foreign Service. Initially I was going to be the political counsel of
                    Mexico, with no background in Latin American affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scratch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I spent eleven weeks studying Spanish and they changed my assignment to
                    Stockholm. I wanted to sit on the living room floor and weep at the thought of
                    starting all over another language of which I had no experience. That, perverse
                    as it may sound, was another lucky break because Mexico, I'm sure it's a higher
                    status embassy and is probably a class one embassy and objectively it would've
                    been a higher status job, but Stockholm suited me better. It kept me in the West
                    European district, which is what I wanted to do. I had a terrific two years
                    there. Two years was enough because after that I was repeating myself.</p>
                <p>Q: You were a political counselor in Stockholm.</p>
                <p>WALKER: Stockholm. It was interesting to see European affairs and U.S.-European
                    relations from that geographic standpoint. The world looks very different up
                    north. Even the maps have a different center of gravity. It was very
                    interesting, but we had some serious issues with the Swedes that made the
                    working life fun and I made lots of Swedish friends, but the job did not offer
                    that much challenge. Sweden is an established Western democracy with whom we had
                    reasonably good relations by that time. So at the end of two years I came back
                    to Washington. Before I went to Stockholm I should say, I ran into the first of
                    my roadblocks about not being a foreign service officer. In 1980, '79, '80
                    George Vest who was the Assistant Secretary for Europe and Al Hartman who was
                    the Ambassador in Paris wanted me to replace Warren Zimmerman as political
                    counselor in Paris, and they rejected several foreign service nominees and
                    George kept telling me I was just better qualified, much better qualified. They
                    really went out on a limb rejecting various Foreign Service members for the
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after you'd been in Stockholm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, before. Before. It would've been instead of Stockholm. I got ahead of
                    myself talking about Stockholm. I was approved through the director of personnel
                    and then Harry Barnes who was then Director General of Foreign Service said he
                    wasn't going to let - in fact I was signed up to start French training. I had
                    some French, but I needed a refresher course. I had a three-three plus in
                    French, but that wasn't good enough when working in a language. So I was signed
                    up to start studying French, and Harry Barnes said he wasn't going to let me
                    have one of the best jobs in the foreign service. Vest's department kept
                    fighting that and holding out for me. The substantive people were absolutely
                    terrific. I had trouble with the bureaucracy, but not with the substantial
                    people in the European Bureau. But it was when foreign service reform
                    legislation was on Capitol Hill and AFSA got wind of it and started threatening
                    to oppose the legislation. It just became too difficult. So I lost that job. It
                    was the first time I felt discriminated against because I was not an FSO. The
                    state department is not an equal opportunity employer between its FSOs and its
                    civil service. So I could've joined the Foreign Service only by taking a
                    reduction to mid-career status, and I really considered doing that, and after
                    Paris fell apart the director of personnel tried to - Ron Palmer - tried to
                    persuade me to do that and offered me the job of Pol/Mil officer in Ankara. I
                    thought very seriously about that. I was vain and cared about status and rank,
                    but I always cared a lot more about the job to be done. And had I been assured I
                    would have an equally interesting job, I'd have taken the reduction in grade
                    with the hope that I could work my way back up on the service ladder. John Kelly
                    who was the principal deputy in the European bureau advised me not to do it. He
                    said, “Frankly don't trust these people. You'll spend a year or two studying
                    Turkish. They'll break the assignment. You could be stuck for a very long time
                    in less interesting jobs.” So I went to Stockholm instead. Stockholm was
                    wonderful, but it wasn't Paris. I came back from Stockholm and encountered the
                    second problem in not being a Foreign Service Officer. Rick Burt was by then the
                    Assistant Secretary for European affairs and wanted to put me in the Policy
                    Planning job for a year before a particular Office Director's job opened up. And
                    Joan Clark who, was then director general, said yes to the Policy Planning job
                    no to a non-FSO's having an Office Director's job. I understand Joan's rationale
                    because it would be harder to get rid of a civil servant because civil servants
                    can't bid on jobs after two or three or four years. So I had rough time there
                    for several weeks. It seemed like a long time, but I don't think it actually
                    was. I was parked in INR but it really didn't have a job for me. Frankly I was
                    killing time. A real INR job might have been fine, but frankly if I'd wanted to
                    stay as an analyst I probably would've stayed at the CIA. But at any rate Arnie
                    Raphael was then the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military affairs. He had
                    been on Vance's Policy Planning staff when I was there, and he offered me a
                    place in the Political-Military bureau, although that was not my particular area
                    of expertise. Arnie hired me first without really thinking through what I was
                    going to do. I was called Senior Advisor to the Secretary, which meant doing odd
                    jobs and some of them were very interesting. I learned a lot. But as you know if
                    you're not in the line, some of the office directors used me and others didn't.
                    So that was an awful situation. But it lasted for about a year. Then I became
                    Office Director for the Office that did European and United Nations arms
                    control.</p>

                <p>WALKER: That was the Political Military Bureau. That was another extraordinary
                    lucky break. I would have never chosen to go to the Political Military Bureau.
                    I'd rather have been on the European Bureau. But it couldn't have worked out
                    better in the end because about the time I became an Office Director Gorbachev
                    took over in the Soviet Union. Arms control which had been stagnant for yea,
                    especially European arms controsomeone called following the conventional forces
                    like watching paint russuddenly the negotiations took on life and it was clear
                    that President Reagan and Gorbachev both were committed to pressing ahead to
                    very serious agreement. At that time the State Department, which meant the
                    Political Military Bureau, chaired the interagency committees that made American
                    policy on arms control issues. I chaired those on Security and Confidence
                    Building Measures and then on the negotiations to eliminate intermediate range
                    nuclear weapons and then the negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to
                    reduce and limit conventional forces in Europe. Three absolutely fascinating
                    negotiations, and they were three-tiered negotiations of course. First, among
                    the agencies in Washington, the interagency group that I chaired. In many ways
                    that was the most difficult because Richard Perle and Secretary Weinberger at
                    the Defense Department opposed all arms control treaties. Richard was very
                    honest about it. He said that even if the United States could dictate every
                    comma of any arms control treaty we still shouldn't sign it because detente
                    euphoria would break out in the West and parliaments and our Congress would
                    reduce defense spending, and the Soviets would somehow cheat and zap us. Before
                    Gorbachev took office Perle was first opposed going to a nuclear negotiation at
                    all. Then he proposed an American position so sweeping thait could never be
                    agreed. And along came Gorbachev who started accepting our non-negotiable
                    proposals. As I thought Perle may have seen his job as saving America from
                    Ronald Reagan, and I saw my job as preventing him from keeping the President's
                    proposals from being accepted. That was one area of negotiation. The second area
                    of course was with our allies. Proposals were presented as American ones to the
                    Soviets. But we had to agree especially with the basing countries, the countries
                    that hosted our missiles on every step of our proposal. So that was the second
                    arena of negotiations. Then of course backstopping our delegation that was doing
                    the negotiation with the Soviets, chairing the Interagency Committee that sent
                    instructions every night and discussed issues with the delegation on the phone
                    several times a day. Absolutely fascinating. When I started this, I knew less
                    about arms control than every other member of the committee I was chairing. I
                    knew just enough to keep my mouth shut and learn it first, but I was learning
                    every day. While State and Defense were at daggers drawn the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff were problem solvers. They made very clear what they could and couldn't
                    accept, but then they were there trying to make the President's policy work. But
                    in my committees except for the one on chemical weapon arms control the
                    atmosphere was cooperative. People at my level were trying to help each other
                    and think of ways without sacrificing what their agency needed, thinking of ways
                    to address other agencies concerns. And at my level we were able to resolve some
                    CFE and INF issueas many as 98 percent of the issues. That of course is
                    misleading because it's the remaining two percent that really matter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The hardest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: The hardest. But still we were able to do a lot of good work at my
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned chemical weapons, negotiations as an
                        exception. What was the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Heavy tension in the room, which was there before I took over the
                    chairmanship of that interagency committee. I worked very hard but not very
                    successfully to eliminate it. It was due to deep aversion in most agencies to
                    having any treaty. There was one provision in the American proposal that all
                    agencies intended be a treaty blocker, but certainly both the JCS and the OSD,
                    which required anywhere, any time onsite inspection. Theoretically the Soviets
                    could've said that some file in the CII don't think such a file existbut let's
                    pretend, a file in the CIA that had the names of all our undercover agents in
                    the Soviet Union was hiding chemical substances and they had to be able to plow
                    through it. Gorbachev, I don't think in the end would've accepted it, but the
                    Soviets were giving the impression they would. The tension was very, very high
                    on that one, and after I left that job Article Ten was dropped from the Chemical
                    Weapons Treaty. A lot of it was personality. I spent a lot of time on all these
                    issues, not just in a meeting room but also outside listening hard to the OSD
                    and other representatives, making sure I understood why they thought what they
                    thought. They knew I understood why they thought what they thought, and was
                    doing as much as I could to accommodate their needs. I think they trusted me to
                    be fair. A time or two on difficult issues that had to go to the White House,
                    the OSD rep at my level would suggest that I write up their option as well as
                    mine. Obviously they read it before they forwarded it, but they trusted me at
                    least to do their first draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Understand their position and be able to put it down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Understand it and to represent it fairly. A+ a meeting with NATO allies
                    when I was at the table and the others were back benchers, the OSD rep passed me
                    a note saying that I did a better job of explaining their position than he could
                    have. I really took a lot of pride in that, but I never got to that position
                    with the OSD chemical weapons people. Partly personalities partly the nature of
                    the issue but it just never worked that well.</p>
                <p>Q: You were very much involved in the interagency policy formulation and decision
                    process and involved also with the NATO allies and to what extent were you
                    involved in the actual negotiations on any of these, in any of these areas?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WALKER: Virtually not at all. I was chairing the committee that sent instructions
                    to our delegations, and as the negotiations were ongoing especially toward the
                    ending, there would be treaty drafts overnighted every night that we would have
                    to meet on and say to the delegation's proposals, yes, no, try again. So I was
                    chairing the committee that did that and sent out, toward the end of the INF
                    process we weren't always able to get written instructions out. This is another
                    place that having trust of the other members of the committee is important
                    because our negotiator Mike Glitman would call me when they broke up usually
                    about six o'clock in the morning their time, midnight my time. I could tell him
                    the different views in Washington, and he would trust me to accurately reflect
                    all of them, not just my own. Then sometimes after the fact, after the deal had
                    been cut with the Soviets, we would send written instructions so the delegation
                    would have a paper trail to protect itself. But it was very exciting. The hours
                    were long. It was seven days a week, twelve, fourteen hours a day, but we were
                    going for an outcome we were all excited about. There was a period when I was
                    flying to Brussels once a week to talk to NATO about one or the other of these
                    negotiations. I would get off an overnight plane, go straight into the
                    negotiations, go until midnight, and usually get on the plane back to Washington
                    the next day. Sometimes I'd conclude we'd done all we could that day at NATO and
                    leave early enough to catch the Pan Am 103, Brussels to London to Pan Am 103,
                    get back to Washington without ever going to my bed in Brussels. Once I got home
                    in Washington about two o'clock on a Saturday morning after a NATO meeting on
                    CFE, knowing there would be an interagency meeting on INF Saturday morning at
                    ten or eleven o'clock. My INF action officer called me at seven o'clock in the
                    morning to tell me I was chairing the meeting at eight. He said I sounded like
                    Andy Devine. But as I say we were all excited about what we were doing. It was a
                    terrific accomplishment; all three of those, CSBM, INF and CFE were all really
                    important accomplishments. They would have been more important had the Cold War
                    continued obviously. But the INF negotiations, I think first the INF deployment
                    and then the negotiations to eliminate the missiles played a part, not the major
                    part, but an important part in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev had
                    the biggest part, full credit to him. CFE negotiations were just coming to
                    fruition when the Wall came down and the Soviet Union collapsed. So I can't
                    claim that they really made a change out there in the real world. They would've
                    done had the Cold War continued. But to be fair, and they came to fruition after
                    I had left that job, they did restrict where Russia based its forces, and
                    therefore how many Russian troops could be in places like Georgia, or the Baltic
                    states. In that sense they did make a contribution.</p>

                <p>WALKER: Those limits had to be renegotiated quite likely after first the Cold War
                    ended and then the Warsaw Pact and then the Soviet Union fell apart. The
                    Russians quite rightly wanted some renegotiation not about how many forces they
                    could keep in the former Soviet Republics who were now independent but on the
                    borders of Russia and that was donnot without difficulty but it was done. But
                    that was after my time.</p>

                <p>WALKER: I was in that job from summer of 1985—I was special assistant—</p>

                <p>WALKER: To the assistant secretary for general purpose stuff. I came back from
                    Stockholm in the summer of '83. So it was later, early '84 that I did that. So
                    sometime in 1985 I took over the political military job, and I left that in
                    February of 1990.</p>

                        Gorbachev and some of the other changes that occurred on the Soviet side, to
                        what extent do you think the attitude of President Reagan was really a
                        significant factor in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Oh it was huge.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WALKER: Absolutely was huge. It was Gorbachev who agreed to accept what we had
                    initially proposed, what we had known we were going to try to propose that
                    favored the West far more than Russia. But Reagan was also absolutely committed
                    to arms control, and I thinI had no personal contact with the man, certainly no
                    conversationbut I think his Star Wars commitment was consistent with his
                    approach to arms control. When he talked about making nuclear weapons obsolete,
                    realistic or not, he meant it. And he was absolutely committed to getting rid of
                    as many nuclear weapons as we possibly could, but also in the CFE to reducing
                    the number of conventional forces and weapons in Europe. And willing to overrule
                    the Defense Secretary in order to do so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Only as a bystander at Reykjavik because that was about strategic nuclear
                    forces. I did not do that. Chemical and biological weapons were the two UN
                    issues I dealt with. Other than that just the European issues. Obviously I was
                    fascinated by what I'd heard about Reykjavik, but I wasn't there, and by that
                    time Alan Holmes was the Assistant Secretary for Political/Military affairs, and
                    all I knew about what happened there was what Alan told his senior staff and I
                    probably shouldn't go into that about whether Gorbachev and Reagan really did
                    agree to get rid of all strategic forces, which is the big issue about
                    Reykjavik, but Reagan's commitment for winding them down as much as possible was
                    firm. He and Gorbachev were soul brothers on that.</p>

                <p>WALKER: President Bush and Jim Baker came in January of, late January, end of
                    January '89, and I went at the beginning of February 1990. So I was there for
                    one year with him, and the Bush team was just finding its feet then. These were
                    complicated treaties that hadn't been completed. CFE, the chemical weapons ban
                    and verification protocol for the biological weapons were complicated things.
                    The new Bush people were working their way through to understand what NATO's
                    proposals were and decide if they wanted to reaffirm them. The Bush
                    administration's issue in my area was CFE. Moscow had always wanted to include
                    air forces. The agreement had always been to reduce to a certain percentage
                    below the number of the side that had fewer. We always knew NATO had fewer land
                    forces than the Warsaw Pact. So any agreement there would mean massive Warsaw
                    Pact reductions and tiny NATO reductions. In fact we had some tanks et cetera we
                    planned to just destroy anyway that we were saving to be our contribution to the
                    reduction. For all practical purposes that reduction was going to be totally
                    one-sided. The Soviets believed that NATO had an advantage in aircraft and
                    therefore had always wanted to include aircraft in the negotiation. We kept
                    telling them that wasn't so, and if we agreed to include aircraft when we
                    finally started to do the numbers, they wouldn't like it. Nonetheless George
                    Bush to his great credit, he was off at a CFC summit at some place in the Nordic
                    area, I don't remember where. He and George Shultz who was with him announced as
                    a concession to Moscow that Washington would agree to include aircraft in the
                    negotiations. The last meeting of the negotiating session then underway was the
                    17th of April. It's funny how some dates stick in your mind. I made the huge
                    mistake of saying, “Ah that's going to be easy. Of course we can commit to
                    putting a NATO proposal on the table before the 17th of April,” because the
                    agreement was ten percent below the side that had, the fewer planes. All we have
                    to do, we have intelligence on Warsaw Pact aircraft, and we obviously know what
                    NATO's are so all we do is subtract ten percent from NATO's number, and you've
                    got a figure to put on the table. It was hell. We discovered, first of all how
                    complicated it was to define what you mean by combat and combat support
                    aircraft. Obviously we wanted to capture as many Warsaw Pact planes as possible
                    and as few of NATO's as possible. But also we found that NATO allies including
                    ourselves didn't always know how many we had. Our records weren't as good as
                    they should have been. The very last possible NATO meeting in order to meet our
                    announced commitment of having numbers to put on the table by the 17th of April
                    went on well past midnight and national delegations kept getting calls from home
                    adding a few more. We managed to do it, but it was a lot harder than we thought
                    it would be. So that and also agreeing to include military personnel in the
                    negotiations were the two big moves that Bush made.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After he was president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: And before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that George Shultz was at the summit with
                        him or was it Jim Baker.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WALKER: That had to be Jim Baker. You're right that had to be Jim Baker. I think
                    if you enjoy multilateral negotiations you have to be a bit warped and I did.
                    It's a zoo but I always did enjoy it. I enjoyed interagency diplomacy, which is
                    maybe even more of a zoo. My previous experience of interagency diplomacy was on
                    President Carter's Policy Planning Staff. I kept responsibility for US-European
                    relations but added to that the human rights account. Carter as you know wanted
                    a big human rights component but nobody in our foreign policy knew how to do it.
                    The deputy secretary of state Warren Christopher was delegated to chair the
                    Interagency Committee making specific decisions about how to use economic
                    assistance or military assistance and sales and other aspects of policy to
                    enforce, to implement a human rights policy. I became the Executive Director of
                    Chris' Interagency Committee, working with various parts of the State
                    Departmenthe economic bureau, the political-military bureau, the regional
                    bureaus, as well as Commerce, Defense, et cetera to balance the human rights
                    agenda with our other economic and security agendas with these countries. Trying
                    to get an agreed decision before Chris's meetings, but when we couldn't do that
                    putting the issue and the different agencies' positions on one piece of paper so
                    Chris wouldn't have a snowstorm of different memos from different agencies for
                    these interagency meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that having you do this from the policy
                        planning staff was more objective, more neutral than say having someone from
                        the new human rights bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Absolutely. Initially they had done it, but they were an advocate and
                    that's what they were meant to be and I was the Policy Planning staff which was
                    more neutral. So that was my first official experience in trying to gain the
                    confidence of other parts of the State Department, but also other parts of the
                    government including parts that weren't primarily foreign affairs agencies, like
                    treasury and commerce and get them to support recommendations about how to
                    advance the President's human rights agenda without damaging other important
                    aspects of American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you at this point would talk just a little bit
                        more about the role of policy planning and your role in it. Now this human
                        rights function seems like very much an operating—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: It was.</p>
                <p>Q: And coordinating function as opposed to broad policy, thinking.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WALKER: Well, it was an advocate for the human rights aspects of policy, and
                    that's how Pat Derian, the first assistant secretary for human rights saw her
                    role. More than some on her staff thought she should've done when our ambassador
                    from a country which was a serious concern to us for nuclear proliferation and
                    also had human rights problems was back in Washington and Pat told this man our
                    only concern in country X was its human rights policy. Well, that just wasn't
                    so. We had other very important concerns. I'm not sure she was wrong to see her
                    role as an advocate, but one unfortunate consequence was that a lot of people
                    soured on the human rights policy. This was my first experience of working with
                    bureaus other than the European bureau. We didn't have these human rights
                    concerns with West European governments that we did in Latin American
                    governments et cetera. And there were people in those bureaus who had wanted to
                    have a human rights factor in American foreign policy, especially after the
                    Kissinger years, were very open to it. Pat's one note advocacy put a lot of them
                    off the whole idea of human rights component to American foreign policy, which
                    is unfortunate. She alienated people who started out as reasonably supportive,
                    in some cases very supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that period where I think the Carter stress on
                        human rights was welcomed, but somehow when it became the be all end all
                        nothing else could really be discussed, it seemed excessive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Well, actually that was the case in some of Carter's rhetoric, which I
                    found unfortunate. It wasn't the way Chris really ran the human rights policy.
                    He was quite happy to be inconsistent for a good cause. When it was a choice for
                    a start between what would make us look noble and pure on human rights and what
                    would actually improve the human rights situation on the ground he always tried
                    to do the latter. It's not always the case that denying an economic assistance
                    program, for example, is the best way to have positive influence. One of the
                    hardest issues is when a bad human rights actor had begun to improve its act but
                    still has a long way to go and the improvement has been in response to US
                    pressure. What do you do to show improvement pays off without giving the
                    impression that he doesn't need to improve anymore. It's a hard call. Nobody
                    knows for sure what the reaction is going to be. So Chris was very willing to
                    take the heat for was when it was a choice of what was more likely to work and
                    what was more likely to make us look good. But then also have to balance the
                    human rights factor against security, economic, or other components of our
                    foreign policy. So the day to day decisions he made were far more balanced than
                    our rhetoric sometimes suggested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you would chair a committee at kind of the working
                        level that would try to reach agreement and if it failed, it would in effect
                        prepare for a decision at the higher level such as the deputy
                        secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WALKER: Yes and often, yes, there was a committee at my level. Sometimes it was
                    me talking to all the other agencies that were involved, but I would prepare a
                    briefing book which told Chris which issues we agreed on and various reasons why
                    but then also what we disagreed on, which agencies felt what and why and what
                    the arguments were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would attend the meetings he would chair. What
                        other, just talking a little bit more about the policy planning period. Were
                        there European issues or U.S. policies that you were very much involved in
                        in that period or was it more kind of more monitoring the European bureau
                        working with them as appropriate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Working with them, and you asked about the state of the Policy Planning
                    Staff. As you know during much of its history it's been a turkey farm. Its role
                    depends entirely on the secretary of state, how he wants to use the staff and
                    his relationship with the Director of Policy Planning. I was just very lucky to
                    be there when Kissinger used it as a substantive cabinet and Vance to a large
                    degree did the same and insofar as we were successful it was working with the
                    regional bureaus. When Win Lord was Kissinger's Policy Planning Director nobody
                    could've been more loyal, but he thought loyalty included honest disagreement,
                    and he was consistently sending memos with cover notes saying this paper
                    disagrees with you and I'm not convinced myself, but it's very well argued that
                    you ought to read it and Kissinger would send it back saying why are you sending
                    such trash, but he would read it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Think about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: He would think it. Sometimes we would see a glimmer of it in what he did
                    subsequently. Only once over my protest did I send anything to the deputy
                    secretary or the secretary which did not also reflect the line bureau's
                    concerns. Sometimes people in the European bureau would come to me because
                    Kissinger would love to intimidate people and he was successful with a lot.
                    People in the European bureau would occasionally come to me saying we can't get
                    this idea across our front office could you help. So I would put it in a memo,
                    if I agreed with it, I would put it in a memo of mine, which Win was more likely
                    to sent the Secretary. Win hired the best people he could find whether they
                    agreed with Kissinger or not. Tony Lake went out of his way to find people who
                    disagreed with Tony and Vance and Carter, to have in-house critics instead of
                    advocates. The only time I did a memo was to Vance it was to appeal a decision
                    of Chris' that Pat Derian and the human rights bureau supported, and Tony and I
                    thought was bad for other aspects of American policy, and I thought that
                    should've been shown to Pat Derian before going to the Secretary so she'd have a
                    chance to put a paragraph or whatever. That's the only time Tony insisted that I
                    not share a memo with the relevant line bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: And it was approved?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WALKER: It was approved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's see. Why don't, I'd like, I don't want to
                        interrupt your very interesting—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Well, I'm chopping back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we are moving around a little bit. I guess I'd like
                        to hear you talk a little bit more about what you did in Stockholm. You
                        mentioned that your relations were generally good, but we still had some
                        issues you dealt with. I know what a political counselor does. He goes or
                        she goes and talks with the government people and the opposition, but what
                        else did you do while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Well, obviously a lot of public speaking and talking to the press and the
                    press attach� saw his role as scheduling me. He didn't feel comfortable, and
                    this is an accident, he didn't feel comfortable with the press. The biggest
                    issue we had to work on while I was there was that sometime before I got there a
                    Swedish individual had given sensitive American information to the Soviets. He
                    was jailed and may still be in jail. But because of that we had cut off all
                    sensitive technology transfer to the Swedes, and the Swedes knew they were at
                    fault. They were trying hard to work their way out of the problem by
                    establishing new procedures. The climax came when Defense Secretary Weinberger
                    made a visit to Stockholm. Boy, did the Swedes do a number. They showed him
                    things they hadn't shown the Norwegians, which is really saying a lot. All of
                    their underground anti-aircraft facilities et cetera were pointed eastward. The
                    Swedes get all misty eyed and naive about anybody who calls himself a freedom
                    fighter in the third world, but when it came to the security of their own region
                    they are very hard headed.</p>
                <p>END OF TAPE 1, SIDE ASTART OF TAPE 1, SIDE B</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were talking about the Weinberger visit to
                        Stockholm and the Swedish effort to reestablish, I suppose, American
                        confidence that would allow technology transfers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Especially a missile called the AIM-9L, which they wanted for an aircraft
                    they were then developing called Grippen, which is now the chief competitor of
                    the Lockheed and Boeing the supersonic fighters. The Swedes as a neutral country
                    would've never said it publicly, but they formulated their defense policy to
                    complement what they knew we were doing. When Weinberger was there they showed
                    him how they had done that, and without so far as I know or consulting anybody
                    else back in Washington he announced at the conclusion of his visit the ban was
                    lifted.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Q: I'm curious though I guess still about why he came to Sweden. Was that
                    something that the embassy pushed hard to arrange? Did the Swedes go out of
                    their way to invite him?</p>
                <p>WALKER: Both. Both. Because we thought the Swedes had come far enough and only by
                    Weinberger's coming himself could the decision be made. Another very big issue,
                    two other issues between us at the time. One was the idea of a Nordic Nuclear
                    Free Zonthat Washington just go hysterical about. There my job was trying to
                    explain the Swedish position to Washington. No Swedish politician could afford
                    to be anti-anything called nuclear free. So the Swedish government especially
                    the people who articulate the policy, endorsed the Nuclear Free Zone but said
                    that obviously it has to include the Nordic part of the Soviet Union, which
                    meant Soviet nuclear armed submarines and ships that were in the Nordic area. It
                    was a way of endorsing a Nordic Nuclear Free Zone while making clear what was
                    the nuclear problem in their part of the world. It took Washington a long time
                    to understand that. The other issue in my job was the difference between
                    Washington and Sweden on Central America. You can remember during the Reagan
                    Administration how much Sweden objected to our Central American policy. Pierre
                    Schori, who was Secretary General of the Social Democratic Party for
                    International Affairs was on the Latin America Troika of the Socialist
                    International and spent a lot of time there. I wasn't going to endorse the
                    Reagan policy myself. I never said to the Swedes I believe the following. I
                    didn't matter. My opinion didn't matter. I'd say it's very important that you
                    understand how Washington sees this, and the Swedes for their part not even the
                    press on the opposition in Parliament ever put me on the spot and said, “Come on
                    Jenonne. Do you agree with that yourself?” Every diplomat has similar
                    experiences. Recently one of my Swedish contacts was ambassador in Washington.
                    He told me the only American ambassador the Swedes had no respect for was one
                    who, wink-wink, nudge-nudge, let them know that he agreed with Stockholm rather
                    than Washington. He shouldn't do it and besides, who the hell cares what we
                    think. An ambassador is here to explain his government's position.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask you, who was our ambassador at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I shouldn't say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You should say who you worked for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Oh it wasn't my ambassador.</p>
                <p>Q: Who did you work for?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WALKER: I worked for a seventy-seven year old Swedish-American businessman called
                    Frank Forsberg who had spend a lot of his time in New York helping Swedes do
                    business in the United States. He had wonderful contacts in Swedish economics
                    and finance. He tried hard to learn the political issues, and at his age which
                    I'm not too far now from myself, just wasn't learning new issues, and he had the
                    good sense to realize it. So he traveled the country with his wife, and they
                    were just great. My job was another one of my lucky breaks. My job was a lot
                    more fun because of that because I handled a lot of the political issues that
                    the Ambassador might have done. The DCM, a political officer himself by
                    background and preference, also resisted the temptation to do the Political
                    Counselor's job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like a good team to work with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Considering it was basically your first foreign
                        service-.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Indeed. I think it was absolutely terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You knew the substance of the issues having been involved
                        across Europe from the policy planning staff but probably the details of how
                        to go about working in an embassy was new.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Actually my teacher for that was a junior officer in the political
                    section because neither the DCM nor Ambassador Forsberg arrived until I had been
                    there for some time. I had a terrific number two. There were only two of us, two
                    Americans in the section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else about Stockholm or thinking back to
                        the policy planning period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Not that I know of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about the very interesting position in
                        political-military bureau in the arms control area after Stockholm, well,
                        somewhat after.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER; Well, it was pretty soon after I came back. While I was the Assistant
                    Secretary's so called Senior Advisor, he used me for speech writing, writing
                    congressional testimony. So I learned a lot, that's one thing I've always wanted
                    in jobs, what I could learn in them.</p>

                        for Political-Military affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I was senior advisor.</p>
                <p>Q: Who was the?</p>
                <p>WALKER: Jack Chain.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: C-H-A-I-N. He was a serving general who, he was only there for. No. When
                    I first went there it was Jon Howe, an admiral. Then it was Jack Chain, a
                    general and then it was Alan Holmes, a very experienced diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there another admiral in there because I was in
                        Cyprus, very much involved with Beirut in the early '80s. It may have been
                        before—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: It may have been before me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I guess it would've been—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Jon Howe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '82, '83 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Jon Howe, Jon Howe had been there a while before I had. And then he moved
                    on the NSC staff, and then he was in Bush administration, and the Clinton
                    administration and he managed Somalia at the time of the failed —</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WALKER: No, just that going there, to the Political-Military bureau was an
                    unlucky break initially because I would rather have continued working on Europe
                    and I resented the discrimination against civil servants, but it turned out to
                    be a very lucky break because of the issues that came up. When I went there, we
                    thought arms control was on hold indefinitely but it broke open and when I
                    joined the Policy Planning Staff when the human rights issue became prominent.
                    It's always more fun working on the beginning of policy when you're inventing
                    something new.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay and as that period came to an end where did you go form there? That
                    would've been about 19.</p>
                <p>WALKER: February of 1990. Then I retired the first time, and I retired because
                    I'd done all I could do as a non-FSO. I was not going to be a political
                    appointee and I was not going to be a foreign service candidate for any of the
                    jobs I might want. It just seemed that I'd done what I could do as a non-FSO in
                    the State Department. I left with great regret because I loved my job and so
                    admired the people I worked with. The State Department has its share of drones,
                    but the good people could be making a lot more money and by not making more
                    money in the private sector, and they don't make more money by working nights
                    and weekends. They're there because they really care about the issues. So
                    because of the people I worked with, and the issues I was lucky enough to work
                    on, I left with great regret. Initially I was looking for a year off at a think
                    tank when Tom Hughes who was then the President of Carnegie Endowment said he
                    didn't want people still on the government payroll planning to go back because
                    it would affect what they wrote, but he said, “You know if you were willing to
                    retire and come on the Carnegie payroll, I'd offer you a job.” And just,
                    sometimes you know in your gut something's the right thing to do. That's when it
                    sort of came together. Taking a year off wasn't going to make my prospects for a
                    foreign service job that much better and I'd had the best of what I was likely
                    to have. So I had three years, two and a half at Carnegie talking and writing,
                    saying exactly what I wanted about US-European relations without having to clear
                    my views with eighty-seven people. Tom turned out to be right. The freedom of
                    saying exactly what I thought was great and I had no desire to go back into
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do a book or articles?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WALKER: I did, Tom didn't want Carnegie people to do books, and in those daythe
                    Berlin wall came down in November of '89 and I went to Carnegie in February of
                    '9it was hard to get an op ed piece in print before it was out of date. So Tom
                    wanted us to have more visibility more often articles, which was fine. I did
                    chapters in edited books and I wrote one book of my own commissioned by the
                    Swedish International Peace Research Institute of Stockholm, about the future of
                    conventional arms control after the Cold War, or rather did it have a future,
                    but mostly I did articles and op ed pieces and chapters in edited books. But
                    then, the luckiest break of my career. Tony Lake became Clinton's National
                    Security Advisor and asked me to come be in charge of Europe on the NSC staff. I
                    had worked for Tony in the Carter years. We were friends and he offered me the
                    job. I was good at the job. But so might other people have been that he didn't
                    know about. It was a terrific accident.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Who you know and whose line of vision I seemed to be in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And timing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: And timing. I was minding my own business reading the newspaper the first
                    Saturday morning in December when Sandy Berger called me. And I'd written an
                    op-ed piece for the New York Times other things about Bosnia and Sandy said
                    would I be willing to go to Little Rock the next day to talk to the governor. So
                    off I went. Six of us sat around in chairs in the library for three hours
                    talking on ideas about Bosnia. Clinton liked to hear people disagree with each
                    other. He likes to try out ideas and have people disagree with him. I didn't
                    realize that was my audition, but I guess it was. I was on the transition team,
                    which began in the beginning of December.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, at the State Department. I was doing Europe and national security
                    affairs on the transition team writing all the papers that the real peoplthose
                    who take office after the inauguratiomostly ignored, which is usually the fate
                    of transition teams.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: January 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't have to be confirmed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, didn't have to be confirmed. Other people like Tom Niles had been the
                    Assistant Secretary in the European bureau and for some time he was still
                    acting. Of those two top jobs, Assistant Secretary for Europe at the State
                    Department or Senior Director on the NSC staff, I thought I would prefer the
                    State Department job. That sounds terrible. Either of those jobs would be great.
                    There's more negotiating in the EUR job, more negotiating with the European. I
                    did a fair amount of that on the NSC job, but that's really State Department's
                    role. But if you really care about substance rather than management, as I did,
                    being in charge of your area on the NSC staff actually turned out to be the
                    better job. During the first Clinton term at leasthe only one for which I have
                    direct experiencthe NSC staff had a far greater toll in shaping policy. I'd even
                    find myself up in the family quarters Sunday afternoons with the President, feet
                    up on the coffee table, his saying, “What do you think we ought to do about this
                    and that?” It was absolutely extraordinary. The people who worked for me had
                    similar experiences. We had to watch what we said because the NSC staff is less
                    bureaucratic than the other government departments, with fewer review levels.
                    Obviously time permitting others reviewed my work. But one of my quite junior
                    staffers, I can't remember which European president was visiting in the very
                    early days, and while I was in those meetings, something came up. I think one of
                    his colleagues in the State Department called him. This question is going to
                    arisI can't remember what the issue waand we need to figure out what the
                    President should say about it at the press conference that will follow the
                    meeting. So my quite junior staffer typed up something, took it to the press
                    office people and the next thing he knew it was coming out of the President's
                    mouth.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: New policy. You're used to everything you do being reviewed by half the
                    population of Washington going through eighteen levels. This, it can be heady
                    but if you're smart you know when to saeven to the Presiden“I don't know. I'll

                        interview with Jenonne Walker. It's the 8th of September, 2004. Jenonne, we
                        were talking before, I believe, about your time at the National Security
                        Council dealing with Europe in the early period of the Clinton
                        administration, '93 and '94. I think we talked about how you had basically
                        Western Europe, and someone else was doing Eastern Europe, Russia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, I had Europe from Portugal to the former Soviet border. So what we
                    used to think of as Western Europe and what we used to think of as Central and
                    Eastern Europe, but not the former Soviet republics.</p>

                        [National Security Council] were dealing with those. The NSC advisor in that
                        period was Tony Lake and Sandy Berger was the deputy, I believe.</hi>

                <p>WALKER: Yes. The big issue of course was Bosnia. It consumed ninety-five percent
                    of my time, close to ninety-seven or ninety-eight percent of Tony Lake's and, I
                    suspect, Warren Christopher's time. It was the first post-Cold War
                    administration, first chance to think fresh about U.S. relations with Western
                    Europe in decades, and we were overwhelmed by Bosnia. It was a terrible mess by
                    the time Clinton was inaugurated. There were no good options. During the
                    transition, the first Sunday in December, I was asked to go to Little Rock and
                    talk to the governor about Bosnia, and Governor Clinton, Senator Gore, Warren
                    Christopher, Tony Lake, Jim Steinberg and I for about three hours in the library
                    of the governor's mansion. The first thing I said to the President-elect was
                    there aren't any good options including doing nothing, which I thought was the
                    worst option. That remained the position throughout my time there. The way the
                    Clinton administration organized things, interagency groups were chaired by one
                    of the cabinet departments, usually the State Department, unless the subject
                    either was of equal interest to both defense and state or it was a crisis.
                    Bosnia qualified as both of those. So I chaired the interagency groups on it.
                    Walt Slocuwho was the under-secretary, assistant secretary at the beginning of
                    defense, he later became the under secretary of defensemade himself the action
                    officer on that issue and later on NATO enlargement. And so because he came to
                    working group meetings, other people, other agencies sent people of comparable
                    rank, which meant my interagency group could do as much as one could do beneath
                    the political level. I'm very proud of the spirit of cooperation within that
                    group although there were deep disagreements of course about what to do.</p>
                <p>During my time on the NSC staff, it's not just that our policies were terrible.
                    Our way of making them was pretty awful. The Presidenthe most interesting mind
                    I've ever encountered, fascinating man to work with, but a deep reluctance to
                    take hard decisions especially when his advisors disagreed. Like any good
                    intellectual he could see eight sides of every issue. I would be told for
                    instance come in at eight o'clock on a Saturday morning for one hour with the
                    president about Bosnia, not designed to take any decisions, just to play with
                    ideas. We'd still be there at two o'clock in the afternoon. Fascinating for me.
                    But it's not a good use of the president's time. It was very frustrating that we
                    weren't getting clear decisions. He wasn't willing, even the decisions he took,
                    he wasn't willing to insist that all of his cabinet level officers stick to the
                    decisions in public even if they were trying to change his mind in private,
                    which of course is fine.</p>
                <p>So it was a very frustrating experience. The Europeans were frustrated with us
                    because they wanted us to sign on to the Vance-Owen peace plan and they would
                    assert to us sometimes, if only we did that, all of the parties in the region,
                    the Serbs, the Bosnians, the Croats would fall into line. We never thought that
                    was so, and for most of my time our position was that we wouldn't endorse any
                    peace plan until the parties had. It was for the parties to make up their own
                    minds. In fact one of the first things that President Clinton did, at our
                    recommendation, was to appoint an observer to the Vance-Owen talks, not a
                    full-fledged participant, and that was Reg Bartholomew. The Europeans don't like
                    to remember that Reg Bartholomew delivered the Bosnian signature on the
                    Vance-Owen plan, but it was the Serbs who rejected it.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I always thought that only serious military force would make the Serbs stop
                    shelling Bosnian civilian centers. They would stand out of range of the Bosnian
                    army because the Serbs had long-range arms and the Bosnian military did not and
                    shell civilian centers. Finally after I left government, we shifted to a
                    position of endorsing a particular peace plan with the Europeans and saying
                    that, if one side accepted it and the other side did not, military pressure
                    would be brought to bear. So finally because of that and a combination of other
                    reasons after I had left Washington, NATO started using military force against
                    the Serbs who were attacking Bosnian civilians, and it worked. Other things were
                    at play at the same time, but that was an important factor.</p>
                <p>So while we didn't have the opportunity that many of us including me would've
                    liked to step back and think about where do we go with U.S.-European relations,
                    what's NATO for now that the Soviet threat has disappeared, in fact we were, I
                    guess lawyers would call it making case law by responding late, reactively, to
                    the Bosnian crisis. We were working out some of the things NATO could be used
                    for. The American role in Europe. What are the real threats to European security
                    after the Cold War? Some of these things we were doing on the run although not
                    in a way anyone would recommend. Tragically late and reactive, but by the end of
                    the day with a lot of bad feeling between the United States and Europe, we did
                    come to a position which worked in Bosnia after I was in Prague using NATO
                    military force on Europe's new security problems, worked in Kosovo and with some
                    US-European understanding although not full. It's continued to be developed with
                    Afghanistan et cetera about the uses of NATO in a post-Cold War world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you thought and of course others
                        thought that only military pressure could've really broken the log jam and
                        brought, focused people's minds the parties and so on. I guess the outside
                        perception is that after the experience of Somalia and some other things and
                        very cautious attitudes at the Pentagon and the Defense department, that's
                        the reason we didn't go in that direction. But was it more complex than
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WALKER: It's more complex than that. But that's an important part of it. That's a
                    very important part of it. Somalia exacerbated feelings that were already
                    present in the administration. Everyone my age has one or more Vietnam traumas,
                    and one that Tony Lake shared with Colin Powell is “no entry without a clear
                    exit”. You remember one, the first major proposal of the Clinton administration
                    was to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian government and use NATO air strikes
                    only so long as it took the Bosnian government to acquire and learn to use heavy
                    arms. The theory was that we would level the playing field and having done that,
                    the Bosnians would be on their own to defend themselves. I thought that was an
                    illusion, that having armed the Bosnians we would be seen, rightly in my
                    opinion, to have entered the war on their side. Then we couldn't walk away if
                    they were being rolled by the Serbs. Nonetheless that attitude prevailed for a
                    long time. When we finally did start using serious NATO air power, there was no
                    clear exit point, but for a long that was part of it and the fact that Colin
                    Powell would have criticized the President. He was then the Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. The President's lack of military service, the draft
                    dodger charge, was a factor on all our minds. So it was more complicated than
                    that, but that was a big part of it. I don't know if we would have behaved any
                    differently if Somalia had not happened. What it did was reinforce attitudes
                    that were already in the administration. Tony always wanted to use serious force
                    against the Serbs. From time to time Warren Christopher did, but then he changed
                    his mind. Colin Powell never did. When Shalikashvili became Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs, he was much more inclined to be forceful about it. But he had a
                    problem in his own ranks. Les Aspin, again like any good intellectual, could see
                    eight sides of the issue. He was very honest in saying when asked, “What should
                    we do?” “I just don't know.” So Tony never had a consistent ally in any of them,
                    any of the cabinet departments. Madeleine Albright agreed with him. She was our
                    Ambassador to the UN, but she didn't speak for a cabinet department. So Tony
                    always was determined to work us toward a more forceful policy. I had given up
                    by the time I went to Prague. Tony bless him, never gave up. He'd get
                    discouraged for a day or two, but he never really gave up on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other issue where you mentioned that maybe we should
                        just touch on here is NATO enlargement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WALKER: NATO enlargement in Central and Eastern Europe. Warren Christopher went
                    to a NATO ministerial in June of 1993 in Athens, and while there he, his
                    advisors came up with the idea of calling for a NATO summit at the end of '93,
                    beginning of '94. He called President Clinton who said, “Okay.” So they proposed
                    it to the ministerial meeting and it was approved. This concentrates a man's
                    mind almost as much as the prospect of having. The transatlantic relationship
                    was in terrible shape because of Bosnia anyway. We thought, I thought and
                    everybody else agreed as soon as I said it, that we simply couldn't go to a
                    summit without some concrete results. Not just words about how much we all loved
                    NATO and loved the transatlantic relationship, but really concrete results. As
                    soon as I got back to Washington, I organized an interagency group on NATO. It
                    wasn't a crisis, but it was equally important to the State Department to the
                    Defense Department. So I chaired that Interagency Group. Organized a group in
                    August, June, July or August as soon as we got back from the NATO summit. Our
                    aim was to use the time when the Europeans were on summer vacation and have
                    concrete proposals as soon as they came back in September. At the very first
                    meeting I put on the table the substance of what became the Partnership for
                    Peace, not the title. I'm not any good at jazzy titles or headlines. Here's one
                    place where Somalia did matter. Our working title, and I don't remember who came
                    up with it, was Peacekeeping Partnership. After Somalia the word peacekeeping
                    couldn't be used. So we didn't really have a title for a long time until Chas
                    Freeman from the Defense Department came up with Partnership for Peace. That,
                    the world believes that that was devised as a sort of second best to NATO
                    expansion. That's not really true. The Partnership was agreed. I don't think the
                    principals had a formal meeting to bless it, but it was agreed, it was not real
                    problem, very early on, and then we addressed the issue of what to do about NATO
                    enlargement if anything. That was very controversial. Some people, I don't think
                    anybody was arguing for immediate enlargement including the Central and East
                    European countries who knew they were not ready. But many of them, the Poles,
                    the Czechs and the Hungarians primarily who were the closest to being ready
                    wanted candidate status or something, some tip of the hat to say they had a
                    preferred relationship and they were on the road to NATO membership. We weren't
                    prepared to do that. In retrospect it's a very good thing we did not because had
                    we done so Slovakia would've made the list, and by the time the first NATO
                    enlargement came along Slovakia had real problems with democracy, with basic
                    criteria for NATO membership. Now it's doing very well, but it wasn't then. So
                    at any rate the decision was made to put down criteria. We worked out those
                    criteria in my interagency group. They were first and foremost solid democracy
                    and a functioning market economy. Military capabilities came lower on our
                    criteria list.</p>
                <p>Q: Civilian control of the military.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WALKER: Oh that's next part of a solid democracy. Yes. Civilian control of the
                    military. Free press, free speech, all the attributes of what one would think of
                    as a Western democracy. And the military contribution was important, but we
                    quite consciously put that at the end of the list. There were various arguments
                    against NATO enlargement as you know. Some were worried about the reaction
                    Moscow and rightly so. I saw strong arguments on both sides. I was worried that
                    by definition—I certainly endorsed our criteria. I thought anthink they were
                    absolutely the right ones, but the countries that met the criteria would be the
                    ones who least needed the boost of NATO membership because democracy and market
                    economy were better established. It would be seen as a poke in the eye to the
                    good guys in countries like Romania and Bulgaria who were struggling but not
                    quite there. In fact that didn't happen. They saw it as encouragement to try
                    harder. The other issue for the NATO summit was about European ambitions to have
                    a security and defense thing of their own. At the time they were talking about
                    through the Western European union, and it's evolved now. It's now through the
                    European Union. And I remember the first session we had with senior Frenchmen
                    who had flown over about it. The Political Director of the French foreign
                    ministry at the time opened the meeting by carrying on at great length about how
                    important it was for the communiqu� to endorse European security defense
                    cooperation. I thought he'd never draw a breath so I could say, yes, we agree.
                    But this summit is not just about a communiqu�. We have to have something really
                    concrete. It was our proposal that if the Europeans, however they wanted to
                    organize themselves, WEU (Western European Union) or EU (European Union) wanted
                    to do something that NATO did not want to do, they could borrow NATO equipment
                    if it was useful to them. The French, not having been part of a NATO's
                    integrated military command, had trouble understanding what we meant. They said,
                    “You mean we need NATO approval to use French forces.” We said, “No, no, no.
                    Forces don't belong to NATO. Forces belong to member governments.” We were
                    talking about things like AWACs (Airborne Warning and Control System), the very
                    few things that NATO does own in common. After several very difficult sessions,
                    the same Frenchman looked across the table at me and said, “You know it's taken
                    us a while. But we now understand what you're talking about and we see how this
                    can be useful to France and useful to the European unity and we want to make it
                    work. We have problems at home.” Mitterrand then the French President, must not
                    be vulnerable to charges by the opposition that this is back door reintegration
                    into NATO military command. Because part of the proposal was that we would form
                    combined joint task forces, which would be headquarters teams, that would be
                    trained and equipped to operate beyond NATO territory. The French wanted to
                    participate in those teams because these they could be used by NATO, or they
                    could be borrowed by the West Europeans themselves to do something outside NATO
                    command under their own command. The French liked that idea but didn't want it
                    to seem to be backdoor integration into NATO's military command. So it was long
                    and complicated. It was very successful. Later when President Clinton made his
                    second trip to Europe for the D-Day trip in June of 1994 after Anzio,
                    Southampton, Normandy, he made a speech to the French National Assembly. That
                    night at President Mitterrand's state dinner important French men were forcing
                    their way across the room to grab a member of President Clinton's party and say,
                    “We finally have an American President who not just in rhetoric but really
                    understands and endorses European Unity.” One of the biggest supporters of this
                    was Shalikashvili who was then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He understood,
                    as Colin Powell had before him, that there were likely to be places where some
                    kind of Western military force would be important, and we wanted a Europe that
                    could do that. We wanted consultation. We hoped for agreement, but it was in
                    America's interest to have a West European thing that could do things we didn't
                    want to participate in.</p>

                <p>Q: So the countries were all eligible, entitled, they could do various things
                    within that framework.</p>
                <p>WALKER: Each would have a partnership agreement depending on its ability. But the
                    idea was, this obviously had political utility because part of their partnership
                    agreement was the state of play in terms of the defense budget, procedures for
                    civilian control of the military et cetera et cetera. But also it brought as
                    many as wanted to join into training and exercising with NATO forces, which made
                    it easier to put together coalitions of the willing when the occasions arose, as
                    it did first in Bosnia and then in Kosovo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, did you represent the United States at the

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, well, no. Obviously there were discussions of it at NATO, but
                    primarily it was bilaterals with the French, the British, the Germans. We would
                    go to their capitals. They would come to ours. There were times we went to NATO
                    both on Bosnia and on the NATO summit issues, but primarily it was done in
                    bilaterals.</p>
                <p>Q: With the major allies, at least in preparation for broader sessions that also
                    took place.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>WALKER: Right. On Central and Eastern Europe, again the Bush administration put
                    in place some very sensible policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first Bush administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: The first Bush administration, toward the former Soviet satellites. They
                    were several years down the road by the time Clinton was inaugurated, and things
                    were changing very quickly in that part of the world. And so from the very
                    beginning of the Clinton administration, I'd been trying to get serious
                    attention to looking again at Bush I policies, how they were working. Were they
                    still the best ones? Could we think of anything else to do? And that kept
                    getting to the bottom of everybody's in-box because everyone was obsessed with
                    Bosnia. But again Clinton was supposed to go from the NATO Summit to Moscow for
                    his first meeting in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin. I said he really mustn't go
                    straight from NATO to Moscow flying over the struggling new democracies in
                    between. Everybody agreed. So it was agreed that he would stop in Prague and
                    invite the presidents and prime ministers of the four North Central European
                    countries, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic. There again a
                    Presidential meeting concentrates the mind wonderfully. You had to have
                    something concrete, and so we came up with a series of initiatives, no one of
                    which was terribly exciting and groundbreaking, but they did add up to a more
                    intense engagement. It certainly wasn't a rejection of what the first Bush
                    administration had done, but it was an adjustment to the fact the time had
                    passed in the new situation. We knew that North Central Europeans were getting
                    very unhappy that they didn't get more by way of NATO membership, a date or
                    associate status or something like candidate status. But they, we didn't expect
                    to obviate their unhappiness with that and we didn't. But they did say they were
                    very pleased because they saw a deeper engagement in their domestic affairs that
                    they welcomed.</p>

                <p>WALKER: Primarily bilateral, which was the way they wanted it.</p>

                <p>WALKER: After that I was extraordinarily lucky to be nominated to go to be the
                    ambassador in Prague. While hanging around hoping the Senate would confirm me, I
                    came out here and studied Czech for a while. I went to Prague in the summer of
                    1995.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and then some times there's a long procedure after

                <p>WALKER: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, I was very lucky. I got in just under the wire on one of Jesse
                    Helm's holds on all nominees. He was trying to get the department to accept his
                    proposal. I think it was, I think this hold was to get the department to accept
                    his proposal to put ACDA (Arms Control and Disarmament Agency) and AID (Agency
                    for International Development) in the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not yet the U.S. Information Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, you're right. It was the U.S. Information Agency and ACDA. So nothing
                    to do with the individuals, but luckily I had my hearings just before that.</p>
                <p>Q: And you reached Prague, when did you say in the summer of—</p>
                <p>WALKER: Mid-July of '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '95. And you were there three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, just a smidge over three years until the beginning of October
                    '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you want to talk maybe to start with a little bit
                        about some of the issues were between the United States and Czech Republic
                        and who your DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) was and—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I was very lucky to have two fabulous DCMs. I inherited Eric Edelman
                    who's now our Ambassador in Turkey. After a year, I knew I couldn't have him
                    more than two years before his tour would up, but after a year Strobe Talbot
                    enticed him back to Washington to be his chief of staff and I got Mike Guest who
                    has just finished being our Ambassador in Romania. So I was extremely lucky to
                    have two really outstanding DCMs. Some issues were common with all of the
                    Central and East European countries. Obviously we liked it if they supported us
                    on Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, et cetera. But it didn't matter critically because
                    they're not major players in those issues. What we really cared about in all
                    those countries was the development of democracy and a market economy. The Czech
                    Republic was in very good shape on democracy. The basics of democracy had
                    returned virtually over night. Free elections, free press, free speech, and
                    there was never any problem, never any threat of backsliding. I think that's the
                    only one of the Central or East European countries of which that was true.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>What had been Czechoslovakia had been a strong democracy during the first
                    republic, 1918-1939. It was the only democracy in Central Europe that didn't, in
                    the broadest sense of the term Central Europe, that did not succumb to fascism.
                    In fact there was less of a fascist movement than in France or Britain. And it
                    had a very strong economy. In the late part of the Hapsburg empire something
                    over about eighty percent of the industrial capacity of the entire
                    Hapsburg-Austro-Hungarian empire was in what is now the Czech Republic. So there
                    was a strong tradition of that, but on the democratic side, there was a strong
                    belief among most Czechs that democracy meant you voted every four years and
                    left things to governments in between, and this was understandable. For the
                    first time in forty-five years people had a chance to build careers, make money
                    for their families, travel, have a different kind of private life. The country
                    was perceived not to be in trouble.</p>
                <p>There were serious economic problems that were not obvious to the Czech man on
                    the street. So people weren't worrying about government. They were doing their
                    own thing. On the economic side it was clear as soon as I got there and really
                    looked beneath the surface that the Czech economic miracle was partly a Potemkin
                    accomplishment. Prime Minister Klaus liked to brag about the high percentage of
                    the economy that had been privatized. But in fact the government still owned a
                    controlling share in the big banks. The big banks owned a controlling share in
                    the investment funds. The investment funds owned a controlling share in many
                    companies and industries. And there was, I never saw any evidence of explicit
                    collusion, but since the leaders of the banks and the businesses tended to be
                    supporters of the center-right government, nobody wanted unemployment to go
                    higher. So a lot of bad money was being thrown after good or good money being
                    thrown after bad. Banks continuing to prop up companies instead of forcing them
                    to restructure and become profitable or go out of business. The most important
                    single thing that needed to be done was privatize the big banks. That began to
                    happen just as I was leaving. So there was a lot of work still to be done on
                    economic reform.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Also at the time everybody was praising the Czechs for having privatized so
                    quickly and criticized the Poles for not having done so. But in fact the Poles
                    put a legal framework in place before they privatized and in the long run they
                    may have been better off for doing it because corruption was pervasive in the
                    Czech economy when I was there. President Klaus and his center-right government,
                    who had done some very good things in the early days, had become the barrier to
                    further reform. Klaus claimed to be a disciple of Margaret Thatcher and Milton
                    Friedman. Margaret Thatcher when she was still sane would never have gone as far
                    as he did in saying there should be no requirement for transparency in the
                    economy, no regulation to protect a private investor from being taken advantage
                    of. We worked very hard on those issues. I probably spent more time on the broad
                    issue of corruption in the economy than any other single issue. Helping the
                    Czechs prepare for joining NATO was critically important, but it didn't take a
                    lot of my time. The defense department, I'll come to what they were doing, which
                    was really very important, other parts of the embassy. But as soon as I arrived
                    there I told the American Chamber of Commerce that I would never suggest that
                    the Czechs buy American or take an American investment bid to please Washington.
                    I thought it would be counterproductive. But if there were any suggestion that a
                    non-American competitor was using bribery, to be blunt about it, the Embassy was
                    absolutely there to work with them, and we never did anything unless the
                    American company in question wanted us to. It almost always was a problem of
                    corruption, and the American company almost always, not always but almost
                    always, wanted us involved. I learned so much. I'd never been in the private
                    sector. But working with the American companies on specific issues was a
                    fantastic education for me. And it was fun and gratifying. Our success record
                    was not a hundred percent in keeping competitions honest but it was in the high
                    nineties I think, and that was versometimes it was very easy. All we'd have to
                    do was let the relevant Czech minister or municipality or whatever know that the
                    American Embassy was paying attention, and at the time they had the United
                    States on this unrealistic pedestal. They really cared what we thought. So just
                    knowing we were paying attention was sometimes was enough to do the trick. Other
                    times it was a lot harder and we would have to threaten to go public.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>There were always important Czechs we could work with, and we would never have
                    been successful without them. But there were people in Czech political party
                    positions or government positions or the governor of the National Bank who was a
                    key ally of mine. It wasn't always just individual company issues. One time the
                    Governor of the National Bank whom I liked enormously phoned me deeply worried.
                    He was quite certain that organized crime was buying controlling shares of some
                    mid-sized Czech banks. He knew he didn't have the investigative tools or the
                    regulatory tools to do anything about it. He wanted our help. He said, “Don't
                    leave any messages for me about this not even with my secretary. I don't know
                    who I can trust.” But I went to the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) who
                    sent over some Czech speaking FBI agents. Some of the Czech American agents in
                    Texas had been very involved in investigating failed savings and loans in the
                    United States and had experience in this kind of thing. They made several trips
                    and I can talk about it now because the circle of those they were working with
                    expanded. Finally they were briefing parliamentary committees and the Governor
                    of the National Bank talked publicly about it. They worked on this particular
                    issue, but they were training Czech security people and bank regulatory people
                    and finally parliamentary committees by working with them on the concrete issue.
                    So there were always important Czechs we could work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Chamber of Commerce. Were those mostly
                        American representatives or a lot Czech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Almost all and many of the same companies now have Czech leaders. There
                    were some Czech leaders already when I was there. But the American companies
                    went into the Czech Republic and elsewhere with their own top people but with
                    the intent to bring in natives as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the, come back to the political side again. One person
                        you haven't mentioned yet I don't think is Havel. And I wonder to what
                        extent was the Czech experience during the Communist period also a
                        contributing factor to the maybe easier transition to democracy than maybe
                        some other countries. I'm thinking of '68, the Prague Spring, some other
                        things that where Communism in Czechoslovakia seemed somewhat different than
                        elsewhere.</hi>

                <p>WALKER: Yes. It's hard to say because after '68 Czechoslovakia had the most
                    repressive Soviet domination of all of the three North Central Europeans. They
                    didn't have goulash communism as Hungary had. They didn't have Solidarity as the
                    Poles had. The Czechs are quite passive. Thirty-eight, '48, '68, by 1968 the
                    Poles or Hungarians would have put their bodies in front of the Soviet tanks and
                    would've been crushed. The Czechs haven't done that since 1620. It's hard for
                    American to understand how history looms. Since the last time the locals rose up
                    against Hapsburg domination and were executed or exiled, the Czechs haven't
                    really stuck their necks out. They didn't go on the streets in November of 1989
                    until the jig was up for Communism. But the memory of democracy seemed to be
                    somehow in the bones. The basics of democracy, the broad aspects as I say
                    returned virtually overnight. It always frustrated me that the Czechs weren't
                    angrier that they were being ripped off by crooked businessmen with the
                    connivance of the government. And some government leaders were certainly on the
                    take and were feathering their own nest because of the corrupt economic system.
                    But the Czechs don't tend to get as outraged as I think they ought to.</p>
                <p>On the political system as you know there are some things every ambassador needs
                    to do. There's also a lot of range for any ambassador to choose things he or she
                    also wants to do. And because the basics of democracy were so firm I spent a lot
                    of time on what President Havel called civil society. Working with Czech NGOs,
                    encouraging them to use my house. It's I'm told one of the three or four most
                    grandiose, ostentatious ambassadorial residences we have. If they have a party
                    at my house, they can get potential donors to come and they'd also get publicity
                    points. So they used the house, and I went to all their events and that kind of
                    thing. I also encouraged any American or Czech company that was doing anything
                    philanthropic to use the house to kick it off or have a party celebrating it. I
                    spent a lot of time with Czech non-profits, a lot of what might have been my
                    private time and never regretted it. That was just enormous fun. I really
                    enjoyed doing it. That's something President Havel of course was very involved
                    in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the government certainly knew what you were doing and
                        was quite comfortable with it and probably appreciated it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Different government members felt differently about it. Prime Minister
                    Klaus didn't really want any other centers of authority. He didn't see any point
                    in civic organizations or regional governments for that matter. His wife was
                    very outspoken on the issue of the Roma, the gypsies, a human rights issue in
                    the Czech Republic. It wasn't a social or political issue because they're too
                    small and too disorganized to roil the waters, but it was a serious human rights
                    issue. She was very active in that and there were others in Klaus's government
                    and out who were very active in helping civil society and would come to the
                    parties at my house and that kind of thing. So there was a mixed feeling in
                    governmental circles, but certainly there was no secret about what I was
                    doing.</p>

                <p>WALKER: Prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prime minister and Havel was the president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: President. And Havel found it very, very frustrating that the Czech
                    constitution, like almost all parliamentary democracies, gives the president,
                    the head of state, so little power. When he spoke as the conscience of the
                    country, he did a wonderful job for the Czech Republic and the whole region. But
                    too often he would publicly say what the defense budget ought to be, who ought
                    to have which ministerial post et cetera, and that was none of his business. His
                    reputation among Czechs by the end of his tenure as president was not as high as
                    his reputation in the outside world because he'd become too overtly partisan.
                    Klaus fell, the Klaus government fell about midway through my time there. It
                    became clear about midway through my time there that the Czechs had serious
                    economic problems that they were papering over with an artificially low
                    unemployment rate. Exports weren't growing. The only companies that were having
                    a growth in exports were the ones owned by foreigners like Americans. Wonderful
                    Czech workers, but they needed Americans or West Europeans to come and
                    restructure the company, bring more advanced financial techniques, equipment of
                    course, obviously technology. So Klaus tried just to change some personalities
                    in the government, and that didn't work. So at any rate finally he was
                    overthrown by members of his own government.</p>

                <p>WALKER: There was a move not from the opposition but from reformers in his own
                    government. The good guys on the center right. So for six months while they
                    prepared for early elections which they've never had to have before, the
                    Governor of the Central Bank took a leave of absence and became prime minister
                    and a government of experts, which was primarily people from, the good people
                    from Klaus' government. Serious reformers from Klaus' government. And then there
                    was an election and the Social Democrats took power, not long before I left the
                    country.</p>

                <p>WALKER: Very closely with, and his interim government in six months did more for
                    serious economic reform than the Klaus government had done in the previous two
                    years. The governor knew that he couldn't move things all the way, but he, as he
                    told me when he took the prime minister's job, he wanted to push things as far
                    as he could, making it harder for whoever took office to backslide including
                    bank privatization.</p>

                <p>WALKER: The embassy, of course, was very involved in a lot of things. Those were
                    the major issues that took up my time. The embassy was involved in helping the
                    Czechs prepare for NATO obviously. One of the great things, and I think this was
                    true of all the transition countries, the United States was on such a pedestal
                    at the time. They really wanted us to interfere in their internal affairs, to
                    give advice on their domestic, political and economic reforms. They didn't
                    always take our advice, which is fine. It's their country. But they seriously
                    listened to it, and every member of the embassy, not just the ambassador, could
                    see a concrete difference he had made, and as you know in Washington you fight
                    fiercely on policy issues, and sometimes the president himself checks your
                    option box. But that doesn't guarantee that's going to make any difference in
                    the real world. I think every member of the embassy staff could see a concrete
                    difference he had made. The Defense Attach� was obviously working with the
                    Czechs, organizing various training programs to help them learn how to work with
                    NATO and eventually be a NATO member. But he was also working with the defense
                    department. How the hell do you prepare a defense budget and present it to
                    parliament? He and the political section and the press section would work with
                    the relevant parliamentary committees, here are the questions you ought to ask
                    about what the defense department tells you about its budget. The Czechs had had
                    to get rid of their whole security service of course. They were very worried
                    about organized crime, drug running, weapons trade. They knew they couldn't
                    protect their borders, and they needed help. So our security people would work
                    with the brand new and inexperienced Czech security service on specific cases,
                    sort of teaching by running cases together on working with those issues. The
                    Press Attach� constantly working with members of the Czech press which when I
                    arrived was so deferential. They'd do an interview with me and then send me a
                    transcript for me to correct before they'd print it, and we would say no—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's like this interview.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: No, you shouldn't do that. Warren Christopher came to town, and I said to
                    him as we were driving in from the airport. You'll be offered transcripts of
                    press conference - what the press is going to—not transcripts but be offered
                    articles in draft of what the press says about you. And bless his heart, he
                    said, “Why I hope they would know they mustn't do that.” So in a lot of little
                    ways as well as organizing training programs and things. The Czech press became
                    more assertive during the time I was there. This was not just because of our
                    efforts, but I hope we contributed to it. They got the idea that they should be
                    investigative journalists. They weren't very good at it. They were rather naive
                    about it, but they got the idea that they shouldn't just print whatever senior
                    government officials or the American ambassador told them. They should think for
                    themselves about it. So all of these things were really very gratifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that your Czech language was good enough to
                        conduct business in the language, but did you need a lot of, need some help
                        at first?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WALKER: It was never as good as I wanted it to be. Virtually all the Czechs I,
                    all the Czechs in Prague, the government people and opposition politicians with
                    whom I dealt spoke much better English than I spoke Czech. There was one defense
                    minister, there were three defense ministers in my time. One of them spoke no
                    foreign language and if I was sitting next to him at lunch or dinner, obviously
                    we would be talking substance, and we'd do it in Czech and I could manage it.
                    But if there were a serious problem, I'd take an interpreter to his office in
                    case I needed him. President Havel speaks excellent English. He chooses to deal
                    in Czech, which is appropriate. It's his country. But he could speak Czech and I
                    could speak English, and we didn't need an interpreter. When my Czech really
                    came in handy was in smaller towns and cities talking to a mayor or the editor
                    of a newspaper or chamber of commerce. I could manage in Czech, but it was hard
                    for me, and I'm sure painful for the listening Czech to hear me mangle his
                    language. I could manage if I had to, but it was never good as it should've
                    been.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were able to do quite a bit of travel around the Czech
                        Republic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, it's a small country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, I didn't always but I always could. Whenever there was a whole day,
                    when I did not need to do something at my desk in Prague, I would be some place
                    around the country, sometimes just for fun, taking the smallest embassy car on
                    the weekends and going. It's a beautiful country, wonderful things to see. But
                    often visiting municipalities, and whenever I traveled around the country, I
                    would invite the local Peace Corps volunteers, the Peace Corps volunteers from
                    that region, for lunch, dinner or breakfast. They obviously did not work for me.
                    They were not part of the embassy. Sometimes it was the closest thing to a good
                    meal they got. They live on really starvation wages. And when I mentioned this
                    to the Peace Corps director who passed through town, he said, “But they
                    shouldn't be reporting to you.” They weren't reporting to me. They were telling
                    me their funny stories. I had gone, even before I presented my credentials, I
                    had gone down to the town in which the last of our Peace Corps groups in the
                    Czech Republic was doing its language training, had a wonderful day with them,
                    just terrific group of, not always young people. Young people, older retired
                    people, some mid-career people who were taking two or three years off to do
                    this. And then I swore this group in at the residence in Prague, so I felt
                    particular relationship with these Peace Corps volunteers.</p>

                <p>WALKER: With this group. And they would tell me their funny stories. I learned so
                    much about the Czech Republic because they live in a different country. I was
                    carried around on a silken pillow in Prague living in this palace, being treated
                    with incredible deference, which was sometimes a problem breaking through the
                    deference. They were living I think it was on sixty, I think it was the
                    equivalent of sixty dollars a month for room, board, et cetera. They were
                    working in some of the rust belt parts of the country, working on environmental
                    issues, on small businesses and teaching English as a foreign language. So they
                    were seeing a different country than I saw, and just hearing them talk about
                    what life was like was such an education for me. So I traveled around the
                    country as much as I could.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: They seemed to. It was fun for me, but it was also seriously educational.
                    I don't think it was just goofing off to go see them as often as possible.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WALKER: He did not. Hilary Clinton came for four days. That's a long visit, a
                    real strain on a small embassy. Prague was the flavor of the month in those
                    years, and one reason I didn't feel any need to come back to Washington was that
                    everybody came to Prague. Chris invited all the Central and East European
                    foreign ministers to meet him in Prague. Thirteen foreign ministers around my
                    lunch table. I was a nervous wreck, but it went very well. The first meeting I
                    had with the Czech foreign minister to talk about this Christopher trip, he
                    said, “We're thrilled he's chosen Prague. Isn't it wonderful? We're so glad he's
                    coming here, and when he leaves, you and I will be the happiest people in town.”
                    You had trips like this. So you know what it's like for a small embassy. But he
                    came. The first September I was there, I had just presented my credentials on
                    the 31st of August because all the Czechs were on vacation over the summer when
                    I arrived, we had the secretary of defense one week, the chairman—no, first we
                    had the chairman, no first we had the secretary of defense. The next week we had
                    the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The next week we had the secretary of
                    the air force. The Czechs loved having all three of them. But frankly it was the
                    same discussion, the same topics with the same Czech officials in the same
                    offices three consecutive weeks. I'm not sure that was the best use of the Czech
                    officials' time. Madeleine Albright came with Hilary Clinton. Madeleine was
                    still our Ambassador to the UN. She came back as Secretary of State and then she
                    came with two of her daughters and their husbands and her sister for a week's
                    holiday while I was there. But we had Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of the
                    Environment, various senior people from the Defense and State Departments and
                    from Treasury. Just a non-stop flow of very senior visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to track down some of Secretary Albright's
                        relatives that were still in the Czech Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I didn't do that personally. When the story broke about her Jewish
                    heritage she called me and said, she's an old friend, and said she wanted to
                    send her brother and sister in law and her sister over to see what they can find
                    out. And she had already put them in touch—I don't know on whose excellent
                    recommendation—with Thomas Kraus the executive director of the Czech Jewish
                    Association, fabulous man. He did a lot of the tracking down and accompanied
                    Madeleine's relatives on visits to not just relatives but people who had known
                    their parents. Her brother John found the ninety year old man who'd held them in
                    his arms when John was six months old and christened as a Roman Catholic. John
                    and his wife came back the next summer with their two teenage sons to visit some
                    of the same people. He wanted his sons to hear these stories before the people
                    died. When they were there the initial time tracking down relatives and friends,
                    they'd come back to the residence at night just worn out because so many of the
                    stories they'd heard were tragic. But also so pleased with how much they were
                    learning about their family, which is why John wanted to bring his teenage sons
                    back to learn this. So I was happy to be a bystander and a B and B for them. But
                    it was Thomas Kraus who did it. Thomas told me that he was spending about a
                    third of his time with mostly Czech Americans but sometimes Czech Canadians or
                    Brits or what have you who had just discovered they had Jewish roots and wanted
                    to learn more about their families.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a couple of times it was a small embassy,
                        and I'm sure it was. But it obviously was doing a lot of things. Did you
                        feel like it was too small?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: For some things, yes. We had about a hundred Americans and about a
                    hundred Czechs, that includes switchboard operators, drivers, carpenters,
                    everybody. We probably had a larger visitor load than any of the other similar
                    sized embassies in that part of the world because everybody wanted to go to
                    Prague. Obviously when senior Americans were traveling through the region,
                    they'd have to spend the weekend somewhere and not being fools, they'd choose to
                    spend the weekend in Prague. So, yes, this was a burden, not so much on me. It
                    was a wonderful opportunity for me because it was, instead of just Czechs
                    talking to the same old people at my dinner table, there would be an interesting
                    visitor from Washington, and I'd exploit the visitors, including from the
                    private sector. We also had a lot of private sector visitors, business people,
                    cultural people, and I'd get, I had a wonderful dining room that would seat
                    thirty-four, and the acoustics were such that everybody could be part of the
                    same conversation. So we would have the visitor lead a general conversation
                    about economic reform, the banking world, press freedom, whether it was true
                    that the level and quality of culture was declining under commercialism et
                    cetera as well as government issues. So for me it was an opportunity. For the
                    embassy, the people who had to do the logistics of the trips it could be a real
                    burden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a number of CODELs, senators, congressmen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Did we ever have a number of them. And one CODEL we did not have, this is
                    something I must brag about. It was going to be a CODEL from the House of
                    Representatives coming to Prague over Easter weekend. They didn't want any
                    appointments except with the President and the Prime Minister. It had to be
                    Easter weekend. They obviously wanted somebody from the Embassy to accompany
                    those visits, and they also wanted an Embassy officer to accompany the wives on
                    sight seeing and shopping. I never deliberately leaked anything, but we sent an
                    unclassified cable with the longest distribution list we could think of saying
                    we'd do our best on the official meetings although Czechs didn't work weekends,
                    but we'd do our best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Especially Easter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Obviously the Ambassador would accompany them on any official meetings
                    they had. We would not provide an Embassy officer for the wives to do shopping
                    and sight seeing, but if they would provide a cite designation, the numbers for
                    their expense account—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, cite, C-I-T-E.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, cite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fiscal data.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Fiscal citation, their fiscal data, we'd be happy to hire a minibus and a
                    Czech speaking guide at their expense. About noon one day in the office, minding
                    my own business, I got a phone call. It was Walt Slocum at his breakfast table
                    at home in Washington saying, “I hope I'm the first to congratulate you. That
                    entire cable is in the Washington Post.” The visit was canceled.</p>
                <p>Where we could've used more people: when Czechoslovakia split apart, the State
                    Department in its wisdom staffed the Slovak embassy with the numbers that had
                    been allotted to Czechoslovakia. We'd had a consulate of course in Slovakia. So
                    we were now trying to do two embassies with the numbers that had been allotted
                    to Czechoslovakia at a time when the political and economic system had burst
                    open. We had fewer than half, Poland's a bigger country. Of course it was right
                    that Poland had more political and economic officers. Hungary is virtually the
                    same population, about ten million people and very close in its situation in its
                    political and economic evolution. The political and economic offices in Hungary
                    were more than twice the number in Prague. So we could've used another pol—and
                    we did finally get another political officer just as I was leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The population of the Czech Republic—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: And Hungary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was about ten million at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you want to say something about the region in terms of your involvement in
                    the period you were there? Did you get much involved in issues between Czech
                    Republic and the Slovak Republic? Dayton happened while you were, not too long
                    after you got there in terms of Bosnia were you and the embassy in Prague
                    involved in these things much?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WALKER: No, no. Very, very little. Occasional things would happen. When we needed
                    to send the very first American troops to Bosnia, it was a matter of getting
                    equipment to them by rail. We wanted, of course, we asked the Czechs at the last
                    minute. Tell us in the next thirty minutes we have permission to do this. The
                    Czech constitution says the parliament has to approve any deployment of military
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through the territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, on its territory. There was no way the parliament could act that
                    quickly. With the best will in the world there was no question the parliament
                    would agree to it. There was no way it could be done in the time Washington
                    wanted. I went to the deputy foreign minister who was a very close colleague and
                    to the man who ran President Havel's foreign policy office, international
                    relations office and said, “I hesitate to use the word sealed trains in this
                    part of the world, but I promise you these people will not get off the train.
                    Can you say that this doesn't qualify as a deployment on your territory?” And
                    they did it. There were small things like that. But in big policy issues,
                    no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was true also of the relation—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Regional issues.</p>
                <p>Q: With the Slovaks.</p>
                <p>WALKER: With the Slovaks. There was no need really for me to get involved. The
                    Czech and Slovak velvet divorce was almost complete when I got there. They had
                    done a superb job of dividing up, not just the countries, and it wasn't
                    automatically clear because sometimes there was a town in Slovakia that could
                    only be reached by a road in the Czech Republic or vice versa. So they'd do a
                    bit of land swaps, but dividing up stacks of paper and typewriters and filing
                    cabinets in embassies all over the world. That was mostly done except for a
                    question of some gold reserves that were primarily in the Czech National Bank.
                    Some of that was believed by some of the international Jewish communities to be
                    Jewish gold. So the question of how much of the Jewish golSlovakia would be
                    responsible for and how much the Czech Republic would be responsible was still
                    an issue. There was no need for us to be engaged in negotiation between the
                    Czechs and the Slovaks on that. Obviously we were very engaged on the issue of
                    Jewish restitution. Stu Eisenstadt was in the country as our special envoy on
                    that issue. We followed up on it after his departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had sort of normal relations with the embassy in
                        Bratislava or—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WALKER: Not more than the embassy in Warsaw or Budapest.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WALKER: And I had expected frankly that we'd be comparing notes more often than
                    we did. We visited each other for the fun of it and obviously told stories over
                    drinks and dinner. The Commerce Department sent the four ambassadors, American
                    ambassadors from those four countries to London, Brussels and Frankfurt to talk
                    about to American businesses in those three countries about investment and trade
                    opportunities. For me the most rewarding part of the trip was having several
                    days to compare notes with my colleagues from the other countries. But our
                    situations just weren't conducive to that much cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about other ambassadors in Prague? Did you, I mean
                        know you went to their receptions and you, but was there any one that you
                        were particularly close to in terms of exchanging information or I know in
                        some parts of the world a country has a particular unique position that is I
                        don't know if that was true in Prague at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WALKER: I saw a lot of them. In all of the NATO candidate countries there's a
                    NATO ambassadorial group. We met once a month and would usually have a Czech
                    speaker, sometimes just have a business meeting. But if we had a Czech speaker,
                    we would also have a business meeting following it. Compare notes about issues
                    of the day. When I'd had one of my senior visitors, I knew they'd all be on the
                    phone to me because they'd have to write their reporting telegram. So usually I
                    would suggest that we all collect around my dining table or somebody's dining
                    table in the middle of the afternoon, not necessarily for a meal. I would give
                    them all a dump on what had happened in the meeting so they could do their
                    reporting telegrams. So I saw more of them than I might have done in Western
                    Europe because of the NATO angle and because we had so many visitors. We had
                    better access than any of them did. So they were more eager to learn from me,
                    not because I was me, but because I was the American ambassador, than I had to
                    learn from them. But some of them at certain times were particularly good allies
                    on some of the economic issues. There was a Canadian, a terrific Canadian
                    ambassador, and on one of the economic issues I was working most intensely where
                    there was a real problem of corruption. There was an American company buying a
                    Czech company, but the bank doing the financing was Canadian. So I worked very
                    closely with the Canadian ambassador on that. One of the big issues during my
                    time there was not a Czech - American issue. It was the Czechs and the Germans
                    trying to arrive at a declaration to put to rest the Sudeten-German issue. That
                    was extraordinarily difficult to do. The Germans had a fabulous ambassador in
                    town who obviously was arguing the German case but understood Czech
                    sensitivities and never lost his sense of humor. Washington cared about this
                    even though we were bystanders, and I talked a lot to the Czech, again the same
                    deputy foreign minister I mentioned earlier who was the Czech negotiator on
                    this, and to the German ambassador about it. So I got both sides of what was
                    going on there. The French ambassador was particularly good in terms of being
                    plugged in to Czech society and understanding what was going on, and the same,
                    he and the same German ambassador I mentioned shared my, on a personal basis,
                    shared my concern about corruption. For instance the OECD had adopted an
                    agreement that all of its member countries would do what the United States long
                    ago did and make it a criminal offense, foreign bribery a criminal offense. The
                    German ambassador said there is no way Germany is going to do that before our
                    next election. It's just too sensitive, but if you hear things about German
                    companies, let me know on a private basis and I'll see what I can do. I'm not
                    sure that was the view of his government or certainly wasn't the view of the
                    French government at the time. But these two ambassadors were willing to work
                    with me on it.</p>

                <p>One quickly learned, I don't know if this is a common habit, but in Prague I
                    would get invitations to what were called diplomatic dinner parties that meant
                    only other diplomats. I was delighted to have that cue because I would say how
                    sorry I was that I was already busy that evening. But I quickly learned which
                    few ambassadors would have really interesting Czechs at their dinner tables, and
                    so I would go to those. I would go to the Russian ambassador's and the German
                    ambassador's because while I was treated like some kind of goddess, they had
                    particularly difficult times because of their countries' unfortunate roles in
                    Czech history. They were both very good guys who didn't deserve it. So I would
                    go to their dinner parties to be supportive.</p>

                        Prague.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Not that I can think of.</p>
                <p>Q: Eventually it came to an end.</p>
                <p>WALKER: Sadly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '98.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes, I left in the autumn of '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Well, just before—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the congressional, well it was not a presidential
                        election that year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Not presidential, no. I came back to Washington for President Havel's
                    state visit in mid-September and I officially stopped being ambassador on the
                    3rd of October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you returned to Prague to say your farewells after the
                        state visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: And then left. Left government then or did you—</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Walker: I left government then and hooked up with an American nonprofit whom I'd
                    got to know in the Czech Republic called the World Monument's Fund. It does
                    historic preservation all over the world and I spent two years in Europe helping
                    out. I was pretty much a full-time volunteer. They paid my expenses but not a
                    salary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you based in Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: One year in Paris and one in London but doing the same job. Not too tacky
                    if you have to leave Prague to go to Paris and London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds all right. Well, Jenonne, I've enjoyed this
                        conversation. I think maybe we'll stop at this point and I'll have a chance
                        to review—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: I've enjoyed it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What we've talked about at some future point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WALKER: Thank you very much</p>
