                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Thursday afternoon, July 13, 1989. This is an
                        interview of Ambassador Arthur Hummel by Dorothy Robins Mowry, and we will
                        begin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Do you have your notes you had the last time, your outline?</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: What do you mean?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last time, you had an outline that you talked
                        from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Are we talking about my speech or personally?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, this is your oral interview which we were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I don't think I had any outline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't? I thought you had some notes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: If I did, I don't have them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't make any difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I'm sorry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I say, I was so horrified when I learned that somehow
                        the tape, the notes, everything, my notes and the tape and everything got
                        lost.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>We will start from the beginning, then. This is an interview about the life and
                    experiences of one Arthur Hummel, which will be of value in the larger oral
                    history of both USIA and the Department of State.</p>
                <p>BioSketch</p>
                <p>I guess we'd better, because of your unusual growing up years and its
                    contribution to your interest in Asia, perhaps we ought to start with at least a
                    little portion of that part of your growing up in China in the war years.</p>
                <p>A. The Early Years</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Okay. Let's see, my parents were missionaries and I was born in China,
                    and spent my early years mostly in Peking. I left when I was eight years
                    old.</p>
                <p>My father moved to Washington where, being more of a scholar than a missionary,
                    he was asked to be the head of the Library of Congress Oriental Division. He
                    stayed there from 1928 or late '27, I forget which, to 1954. I more or less grew
                    up here in Chevy Chase.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything specific about Beijing or Peking,
                        as it was then called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By comparison with the more recent —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I remember quite a lot of street scenes. We got out quite a bit on
                    excursions to the hills in the west and so on. However, like a number of
                    missionary kids, I think, coming back to the States was traumatic and I sort of
                    put all that away and didn't even want to speak Chinese anymore.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, because of the Chinese servants and the fact that my parents
                    were practicing their own Chinese, I spoke Chinese before I spoke English but
                    that withered away considerably.</p>
                <p>I went to prep school. My father became a Quaker and I went to a Quaker prep
                    school. I was one of the rebellious young people, like a preacher's son very
                    often will be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Preacher's sons are very notorious. My husband is a
                        preacher's son.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: As a matter of fact, I got kicked out of prep school, but then returned.
                    Then I was a drop-out from Antioch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the prep school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Westtown, Pennsylvania. I went to Antioch but dropped out for lack of
                    interest, and spent a couple of years roaming around, mostly in the Midwest,
                    doing odd jobs and floating from town to town. I had a great time.</p>
                <p>B. Return To China: September 1940</p>
                <p>Then my father was invited to go back to Peking for a book buying and research
                    stint of several months, so my parents decided to take me with them and sent me
                    ahead. I arrived in September 1940. Then, their trip was canceled because of
                    tension in the Far East, but I was too dumb to leave.</p>
                <p>When I arrived there, I immediately went to a Chinese language school, the same
                    school where my father had been part of the faculty and where I used to live as
                    a child, the Peking Language School. My language came back in a rush but, of
                    course, I had to study the written language for the first time.</p>
                <p>C. After Pearl Harbor, Interned by Japanese</p>
                <p>I was studying Chinese with a tutor and teaching English to support myself. I was
                    too dumb to leave before Pearl Harbor. I got interned by the Japanese, first,
                    one year in Peking, a very loose kind of internment. Then they shipped all of us
                    enemy aliens — British, Canadians, French and so on — down to a camp in Weihsien
                    in Shandong Province.</p>
                <p>I was there for a year and then eventually escaped with a British friend and
                    joined Chinese guerrillas nearby and stayed with them until the war was
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask, by reason of policy, were you adequately
                        informed by the Embassy or by the American authorities that it was time to
                        get out? Policy is the reason for asking this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think so; yes, there was a concerted effort made. As a matter of fact,
                    there were married couples in which the wife was sent home in response to the
                    urging of the American government.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>When the man stayed on — and this happened in many cases — and was interned by
                    the Japanese, he was eligible for repatriation as a reward for having done what
                    the government said. Those whose wives stayed with them were not eligible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never knew that difference before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: All American women and children were eligible, but men were eligible only
                    if they had obeyed the instructions to send their wives home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How tough were those Japanese internment camps at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It depends on where you were. I was in the one that was farthest north,
                    closest to Japan, and that meant supervision by the Gaimusho, the Foreign
                    Ministry. The military ran the camp, but the Gaimusho supervised them and
                    ameliorated a lot of the hardships.</p>
                <p>So, the camp I was in was much more bearable than the one in Shanghai, which was
                    really quite grim. Santo Tomas in the Philippines was worse and, of course,
                    Borneo was horrible. The farther away you were from Japan, the worse these
                    civilian internment camps were.</p>
                <p>In this particular camp, we had more births than deaths but it wasn't pleasant;
                    the diet was substandard, so it was no picnic.</p>
                <p>D. Escape from Internment Camp: Joining Chinese Guerrillas</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you manage to escape?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: My friend and I had been trying for a long time to make contact by
                    letter, smuggled letter, smuggled out by Chinese coolies who worked in the camp.
                    We eventually got an answer from a Nationalist guerilla unit nearby, set a date,
                    and got permission from the allied camp authorities to leave.</p>
                <p>The guerilla outfit wanted to be in contact with the Americans, hoping that they
                    could parlay this into some kind of support. The camp authorities felt it would
                    be a good idea to have somebody out in the boondocks nearby, in case of — well,
                    in case of whatever happened.</p>
                <p>Nobody knew whether, at the end of the war, the Japanese would start massacring
                    people or whatever, so they felt it would be a good idea to have some people
                    outside. So, in a sense, we were emissaries from the camp.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The guerilla outfit was very interesting and very self sufficient and very
                    patriotic. It was one of the very few such efficient and patriotic Nationalist
                    guerilla outfits. Communists were all over the place; it was just an accident
                    that we wound up in contact with the Nationalist guerrillas rather than the
                    Communists.</p>
                <p>If we had escaped into Communist hands, we could have walked back to Yen'an and
                    gotten out, possibly, but the Nationalists were just in small pockets — not so
                    small, an area of about ten miles by twenty miles that was in a densely
                    populated flat plain.</p>
                <p>There wasn't any running around and riding horses in mountain forests. It was a
                    typical North China plains area and the Japanese didn't come in unless they were
                    in overwhelming force, trying to mop up the place. They did that several times
                    the year and a half that I was living there. That's another story. I've got the
                    memoirs of the guerilla commander and I am translating and annotating those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope you're going to do something with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>E. End of War; Work With UNRRA; Return to U.S.</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Some day. I've done some of it.</p>
                <p>After the war was over, I spent a year working for UNRRA in North China doing
                    survey trips into Communist areas; that was my first contact with the Chinese
                    Communists.</p>
                <p>Then I went back to the States and worked for awhile for the United China Relief
                    Organization.</p>
                <p>Completion of Education; Employment in Department of State, Far East Bureau,
                    Information (FE/P), Predecessor of USIA 1950</p>
                <p>In 1947, I went to the University of Chicago and in two years, got an M.A. in
                    Chinese Studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They must have given you credit for a lot of practical
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I had to pass some comprehensive examinations that were given to a lot of
                    people whose education had been interrupted by the war; there was a rather
                    lenient program for that purpose. I had to make up a deficiency in Economics
                    101, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you finally did get your academic credentials.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: Right after that, when I got my M.A., Phi Beta Kappa, I almost
                    immediately joined ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence, and worked for them
                    for about six months. Then, through the good offices of people who later became
                    USIS people like Joe Bennett, Brad Connors and others, I joined FE/P (the Office
                    of Information of the Far East Bureau), in the State Department. The Information
                    Function was still at the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've gotten now to what, to about 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Somewhere in the 1950s for the State Department.</p>
                <p>Nature of Early Work in FE/P</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing for FE/P?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: We were still trying to mop up the tag ends of USIS programs in Hong Kong
                    and establishing them in Taiwan, as far as the China program was concerned.
                    Also, we were engaged in supporting, with research materials, some of the people
                    who were being harassed by McCarthy during the McCarthy hearings period. So, we
                    would help them with background materials and public statements and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that affect what was going on in FE/P at all, except
                        for your support work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Not particularly. I think because, when the Communists took over in 1949,
                    they showed, themselves not to be agrarian reformers, and they showed that they
                    were not abiding by their promises to have a multiparty system and accommodate
                    other parties. Also, because of the well-documented killing of landlords and
                    class enemies, there wasn't anybody who wanted to do anything differently in
                    American policy, particularly after the Korean War started.</p>
                <p>By the time I joined the State Department, the Korean War was on, so there was no
                    occasion for the dissent. Our relations with China, whatever they were, did not
                    leave room for anybody to be thinking about conciliation or advancing heretical
                    views about American policy. We were all polarized by these events.</p>
                <p>Later on, in the '60s, when we began to have tentative contacts during the Laos
                    negotiations in '61 and then the Warsaw talks, there were some possibilities for
                    contact, but the Chinese themselves showed that they were not terribly
                    interested in what we had to offer unless we would simply abandon Taiwan and
                    deliver Taiwan to them. That, of course, wasn't possible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, none.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everything was closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Our embassy was in Taiwan. For a time afterwards, our people stayed in
                    place on the mainland, but the Communists treated them so badly that there
                    wasn't any hope. I am fond of reminding people that we terminated all assistance
                    to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, military and civilian, and left our people
                    basically in place in the mainland. But the Chinese Communists spurned us in the
                    beginning and then, of course, the Korean War was guaranteed to stop any
                    contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Korean War presented a whole new picture, or it
                        clarified things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, it did. Now, when Chinese troops crossed the Yalu, when we were
                    fighting Chinese troops, there wasn't much point in anybody advocating anything
                    conciliatory.</p>
                <p>So, my view is that American analytical reporting about China was not appreciably
                    affected by the McCarthy tide, certainly not after the Communists took over in
                    1949.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: A lot of people continued to have a bad time; Clubb, Remington and so on,
                    those whom I met. Having been cut off behind Japanese lines, I was not part of

                <p>1952. Assignment to USIS, Hong Kong</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Two years. I met my wife in the State Department. She was working on the
                    Near East Information Program. Let's see, I joined in '50, we married in '51,
                    and in '52, we were assigned to Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good place to go on the first assignment in a
                        family. What did you do in Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I was sent out originally to replace Doak Barnett, who had been called
                    the Evaluation Officer, trying to organize evaluations of USIS programs, not
                    only in Hong Kong but on a regional basis; that is, polling, surveys of various
                    kinds, as assets for our USIS planning. Not much of that got off the ground.
                    Doak Barnett, I think, got bored with it and left and so I was sent out to
                    replace him.</p>
                <p>After a Few Months Becomes PAO, Hong Kong</p>
                <p>Very shortly thereafter, a few months after we arrived in Hong Kong, Paul
                    Frillman, the PAO, left, resigned, I believe, and they made me PAO. We had such
                    bright lights as Dick McCarthy and Charles Cross, who became Ambassador to
                    Singapore. There were some good men.</p>

                        China at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It was, very big. One of the innovations that I am proud of — I didn't
                    invent the idea, but I helped to get it started — was the establishment of a
                    Chinese language magazine called “World Today” which circulated throughout
                    Southeast Asia for the overseas Chinese, in Chinese, and circulated also in
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>It was so good in its content and format that it was sold through the regular
                    news networks. It was not a give-away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Mandarin, the written language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the first of these magazines that USIA published
                        overseas? Subsequently, there were any number of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I can't be sure it was the first. I honestly don't know. It was an early
                    one, and the key to its success was that it managed to meet newsstand standards
                    and compete with all other magazines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of material would you carry in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: News, commentary, anti-Communist stuff about the mainland, things about
                    the United States. It was sort of a generalized magazine, fairly popular, quite
                    a bit of stuff on movie stars, Chinese movie stars.</p>
                <p>I remember having the pleasure of getting the absolute top Chinese movie star, a
                    beautiful girl named Li Li-hua, in Hong Kong, getting her together with Clark
                    Gable for a picture for this magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a combination, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: They had their picture taken on a boat with the Hong Kong Island in the
                    background. That was on the cover; that was a great issue.</p>
                <p>Also, I took the opportunity to travel throughout Southeast Asia to all of the
                    major places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you couldn't get into China then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, I couldn't get into China. I did surveys of the overseas Chinese,
                    just simply to survey places, and I can't name them all, but Vietnam, including
                    Hanoi and Saigon, at that time still in French hands, Thailand, Indonesia,
                    Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and I didn't get to Brunei, but the Philippines,
                    Burma, doing comprehensive reports of local Chinese populations.</p>
                <p>We, in Hong Kong, were publishing materials in Chinese for the whole area, and,
                    of course, visiting Taiwan, too. All that was personally very pleasant.</p>

                <p>The 1952 PAO Regional Conference in Rangoon:Incompetence of Director Compton</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes; that's what I was. I was not an FSO. I remember there was,
                    shortly after I arrived in Hong Kong in '52, I went off to attend a PAO
                    conference in Burma where the Director Compton — was it Wilson Compton?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It could have been Wilson. There were a batch of
                        Comptons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Anyway, it was one of the most dismal things I've been through because
                    Compton was not competent and showed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably was Wilson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: The rumor was that when they phoned him up to ask him if he would be the
                    head of USIA, then the new organization, they phoned up the wrong brother,
                    Compton. They were thinking of his more talented brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are two others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: There are two others, yes. Anyway, they didn't tell me until the end of
                    the last day of the conference that I would be put in charge of writing a report
                    for the conference. I had taken no notes, was not responsible for taking notes,
                    and then I had to try and rehash it all.</p>
                <p>After the conference closed off, I spent about ten agonizing days in Rangoon with
                    the PAO there, Lionel Landry, trying to recapture what had been said and trying
                    to make it sound sensible. It was no easy task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they talking about at the conference? Was this
                        just planning for programs or was it policy development?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think it was more of a briefing of the Washington visitors, Compton and
                    the others, than anything else, and an exchange of experiences. There was a
                    certain amount of discussion of overseas Chinese because this was one of the few
                    issues to cut across all of the countries there or most of the countries.</p>
                <p>The biggest program, of course, was Japan, a huge program they inherited from the
                    occupation, but all of the other programs were considered interesting and
                    significant and important, in varying degrees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lionel Landry is a good friend of mine. We've worked
                        together, most recently at the Aspen Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: As it turned out, I followed him in Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hummel Becomes Deputy PAO, Japan 1955</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: As the PAO, because from Hong Kong — let's see, we arrived in Hong Kong
                    in '52, left in '55; from '55 to '57, I was Deputy PAO in Tokyo, managing a much
                    larger program under Joe Evans, two years, from '55 to '57. That, I enjoyed very
                    much and traveled to all of the cultural centers, 12 to 13 of them at the time,
                    and learned quite a bit of the Japanese language.</p>
                <p>From there, I went to Burma as PAO, replacing Lionel Landry, from '57 to '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were overseas constantly during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: '52 to '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you make of all those branch posts in Tokyo, or
                        in Japan, obviously during one of the final cut-backs? They've cut back
                        since then, but it was such an agonizing kind of thing. It was so emotional
                        for the Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes. Well, as the country grows up and reconstitutes or constitutes its
                    own media and cultural activities, the foreign input becomes a smaller
                    percentage of the total pie. So, the cultural centers that were almost the only
                    thing around that had had intellectual stimulation in the early days of the
                    occupation were increasingly supplemented and superceded by Japan's own lively
                    efforts.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Still, I don't mean to denigrate it because, throughout this whole period, there
                    was an intense curiosity on the part of the Japanese about everything western.
                    They wanted to learn about everything. They are terribly single-minded, as
                    everybody knows.</p>
                <p>By the time it became necessary to chop, when that time came, I think that was
                    probably a rational decision because the need was no longer quite so great. In
                    the same sense, the Fulbright Program that had been absolutely essential in
                    bringing people out of environments such as Japan, China, wherever, and
                    vice-versa, later became a small part of the huge tide of exchange of persons
                    that eventually went on through other auspices.</p>
                <p>So, I think it had been highly valuable in the immediate post-war years, as USIS'
                    program throughout the world was more valuable everywhere then than it is now,
                    because it is quite often submerged under other media efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the rationale when I was there for further
                        cutting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I'm afraid that's probably a good rationale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the situation in Germany, when they started to cut
                        there, it seemed to be more difficult to cut in Germany than in Japan, but
                        it made the same kind of rationale: You could spend your money on other
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1957: PAO, Burma</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think I agree with that priority. There were other priorities in places
                    like Burma, where I went to next, where there was even more need because the
                    Burmese were even more insular than the Japanese then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick Burma yourself? Did you request Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think I did. Well, I floated some ideas. After three years in Japan as
                    a deputy, obviously, I wanted to go back to running my own program again. I had
                    been attracted to Burma. The Burmese are such lovely people. I studied quite a
                    bit of language when I was there. For one hour a day in the office, you don't
                    get terribly far, but I got to where I could travel around on my own and so
                    on.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Those were the golden days when the place was wide open. The immediate
                    insurgencies right after independence had subsided and the new insurgencies had
                    not arisen yet. There were no Kachin insurgents in the Kachin State and
                    virtually no Shan insurgents in the Shan State. I drove my own jeep all over
                    those exotic areas that now you can't go to at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I did a lot of hunting and hunting trips were my excuse. I must say I
                    don't think I did much formal USIS work on those trips; I was entertaining
                    myself, and learning a lot about the country and about the people. Usually, I
                    tried to be the only white face in the bunch and traveled only with the
                    Burmese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of Burmese did you travel with? Was this part of
                        the national staff of USIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Usually.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes. Of course, I would meet the local rulers of the various states
                    and the governors and the other people in the other areas. I did my job, but I
                    also enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How interested were they in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Very much so. There was a long cultural tie involving missionaries,
                    American missionaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: In Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: Well, British, too, but a lot of Americans. The most famous name was
                    “Judson” and many of the missionary efforts were successful, not among the
                    majority Burmans, but among the Karens, an animist people. The Burmans, with
                    their solid basis in Buddhism, didn't take much to Christianity, but there were
                    a lot of other ethnic minorities in the country who did.</p>
                <p>The University of Rangoon had strong American ties, although originally, of
                    course, British. We had a consulate in Mandalay. The British didn't have a
                    consulate in Mandalay; they'd closed theirs up quite early.</p>
                <p>So, our presence was known and valued, and American assistance was appreciated.
                    In spite of the fact that we'd been caught red-handed supplying KMT guerrillas
                    in the Shan state and contributing to disruption in the Shan State, making
                    efforts to make trouble for the Communists in Yen'an Province next door at
                    Burma's expense. In spite of that, we'd gotten over that chilly period and
                    Americans were welcomed everywhere.</p>
                <p>I had a good, close relation even with Prime Minister U Nu and General Ne Win,
                    who was Defense Minister.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Cultural figures came through; Marian Anderson, for instance, singing in
                    the university hall, who was an absolute, smash hit. Atoms for Peace exhibits

                        Ambassador to Burma. I'm interested in your assessment, just a little bit,
                        of the development of that, the looking in, the withdrawing from the outer
                        world, which obviously was not part of this period when you were first
                        serving in Burma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Then subsequently, they closed off and now, I guess it's back again to the same
                    thing.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: It was quite open under U Nu. There was a period when Ne Win took over by
                    mutual agreement, at the request of the political parties in early '58. Ne Win
                    had a military government for a short period of time and then did have the
                    elections he was supposed to have, and turned the government back to U Nu when U
                    Nu won the election.</p>
                <p>Basically, the government was open and wanted to be open. They were proud of U
                    Thant as their man in the U.N. and, to this day, there is a disproportionate
                    number of Burmese who work for the U.N. and for our international organizations,
                    the World Bank and IMF — very good ones, too.</p>
                <p>You were asking about the Burma situation. What happened when Ne Win took over in
                    '62, uninvited, was he managed a coalition between military authoritarians and
                    left-wing intellectuals. The left-wing intellectuals, to this day, and the
                    military authoritarians, have just run everything into the ground.</p>
                <p>Marxist theory and socialist theory was used initially to abolish every scrap of
                    private enterprise. Even the tea shops were closed. Little sundry stores were
                    closed up. The state was going to supply all of these things, with no more
                    profiteering by individuals.</p>
                <p>Gradually, of course, they had to release this because nothing worked. Well,
                    nothing really does work even today. They are most unwilling to admit error.
                    There has been the rise of a new class of military people who are the
                    beneficiaries, military and high-level administrators, who have their own shops
                    and their own system, who are doing very well, thank you.</p>
                <p>They know that if they turn back to a more democratic forum or change the forum,
                    their privileges will disappear. I'm afraid they didn't learn their lesson with
                    the last disturbances a year ago and maybe there will have to be more.</p>

                <p>National War College, 1961, VOA Deputy Director, 1962-3</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>After Burma, I went to the National War College for a year, the class of '61 and
                    then Voice of America as deputy for two years. There, I did a good deal of
                    overseas travel, negotiating unsuccessfully everywhere for VOA transmitter
                    sites.</p>
                <p>Difficulties of Trying to Negotiatefor VOA Transmitter Stations in Foreign
                    Countries</p>
                <p>In Cyprus, Makarios decided he didn't want to share time on a transmitter with
                    the American government. In India, after almost two months of excruciating
                    negotiations and waiting around, we finally signed an agreement for a
                    medium-wave transmitter on which we would share time with India. Krishna Menon
                    didn't like it, so we no sooner signed it than he found out about it and tore it
                    up or had it torn up.</p>
                <p>In Thailand, we tried the same thing. The Thais were itchy about having an
                    American installation broadcasting to China. The Philippines, that was all
                    right, but that had already gone forward and had already started. I helped to
                    negotiate some of the expansions in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's disheartening when you go from one place to another

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, that wasn't it. The individual experiences were — the results were
                    quite disappointing, but the experience was quite pleasant. I enjoyed meeting
                    all of them, and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant, not chilly. It was a
                    good experience of negotiation, I may say, particularly with the Indians, who
                    are terribly difficult people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: He was the Defense Minister, but he wielded a great deal of power outside
                    of his own ministry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was involved with the negotiations for Sri Lanka. I
                        don't know where that stands at this particular moment, given the situation
                        in Sri Lanka. They were such wonderful people to — even though they are so
                        wonderful to work with, it would seem to me it went on and on and on and
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you feel that, in these negotiations you were undertaking in all of these
                    places — and these were always for shared time — they were concerned about their
                    own sovereignty or they just didn't want any intrusion? Was political
                    sovereignty the issue?</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, not so much political sovereignty as a disinclination to be
                    criticized by Communists, to whom a lot of our broadcasts were directed, against
                    whom they were directed, and also a disinclination to be accused of being in the
                    American pocket, of having American bases, in other words.</p>
                <p>Also, the package we were offering would be that we really could not, with these
                    megawatt medium-wave transmitters that we were interested in, although we were
                    interested in others, too, but with that sexy piece of equipment, you can't
                    change frequencies appreciably.</p>
                <p>They are built for a certain frequency and, therefore, it would be obvious to
                    every listener that the local broadcast, when it came time for the Indian
                    government to start their broadcast, would be exactly in the same place, same
                    frequency, same kind of signal, which they didn't find terribly appealing.</p>
                <p>The idea of having a giant transmitter that they could use for their domestic
                    purposes, as well as the medium-wave to China, which we were very interested in,
                    that appealed to them a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Deputy to the Director at the VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Deputy to Henry Loomis the whole time. One of the highlights of that
                    experience was that under Ed Murrow, a great guy, in VOA, we had to continually
                    fight off battles from the hardline propagandists like Sorensen and some others,
                    who wanted to curtail VOA's freedom of commentary and even news.</p>
                <p>So, I appealed repeatedly — if I remember, Henry was gone; he was making trips,
                    too, of the same type. Henry Loomis was gone, and I had to appeal repeatedly to
                    Edward Murrow and generally won. Murrow generally came down on the side of
                    reasonable freedom for the commentators.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Two years, '61 to '63. Then for two more years, '63 to '65, I was Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary in CU, cultural programs of all sorts.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, I think I wanted to get with the State Department where a lot of
                    more substantive things were happening. Some of my friends had done a lateral
                    entry, Charles Cross, for instance.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Into the State Department and became FSO. I don't know that I made a
                    serious effort to be an FSO, but the State Department is obviously a bigger
                    organization. Honestly, I didn't know whether I wanted to be a PAO the rest of
                    my life, even though it was a marvelous job; particularly in Burma. I think I
                    enjoyed that as much as anything I ever did.</p>
                <p>The prospect of spending twenty more years — and this is a prospect that USIA

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Still, one of the renewing things about the whole business, as we all
                    know, is the opportunity to enter a different culture, learn about it. We are
                    required to learn about it, study it, experience it.</p>
                <p>Difficulties with Bobby Kennedy</p>
                <p>CU had a lot of tensions in it including Bobby Kennedy, who was not a nice

                    of administration was to be abrasive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Attorney General then, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, but he was asked — he volunteered — by his brother to make sure that
                    we were contacting the youth of the world, which is a legitimate enough
                    objective, and to try to make sure that we didn't — all the programs, military,
                    et cetera, didn't slight youth contacts.</p>
                <p>So, the youth committee, an interagency committee that usually Luke Battle, who
                    was Assistant Secretary, would chair, or I had to chair occasionally when he was
                    away, would have Bobby Kennedy sitting at the right-hand side, jabbing
                    everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came to the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, indeed, he did. That contributed to some tension. Also, the political
                    use of the program was pretty obvious, too, some of the exchange persons
                    programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the same thing, then, that you had been fighting
                        with Sorensen on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: Somewhat, yes. Still, Harry McPherson came in after Luke Battle left.
                    Harry is also a very, very great guy and still a great friend, as is Luke
                    Battle. Harry moved on unofficially, kidnapped back by Lyndon Johnson, whom he
                    had been with before and who needed him in the White House, so he spent most of
                    his time over in the White House.</p>
                <p>So, I was acting on one memorable occasion when Bobby Kennedy, then Senator,
                    decided that he wanted Eugene Nickerson, of Nassau County, New York, a
                    politician, to do the tour of what we used to call the Three I League — Ireland,
                    Italy and Israel — on a State Department grant.</p>
                <p>Bobby Kennedy leaned on me directly, first indirectly and then directly by
                    telephone. After stalling for a bit, I did what I should have done in the first
                    place. I called up Harry McPherson and Harry said he'd check it out.</p>
                <p>He came back with the news, I remember it very well, he said, “El Numero Uno,”
                    meaning LBJ, “El Numero Uno does not want Nickerson to get a grant to go abroad
                    for this purpose.” I said, “All right. Now, who shall I tell Bobby Kennedy made
                    this decision?” Harry said, “You will tell him you made the decision.” So, I
                    did. It was a very unpleasant twenty minutes I spent in Bobby Kennedy's Senate
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was face to face?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Face to face, telling him I did it on my own and that I didn't believe in
                    American politicians going — the program being used for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Still, I enjoyed the whole — really, I'm talking about negative aspects of it,
                    but I enjoyed it all because of the opportunity to meet fascinating people —
                    writers and other people that I never would have met going abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your funding was pretty good at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you could do a fairly respectable job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: The program was entirely worthwhile and very satisfying. The
                    African-American and African dimension here was also getting to be very high.
                    The whole civil rights movement itself promoted the application of blacks going
                    abroad and of making sure that African countries sent people here and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>After that —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I, in this setting, is it appropriate for me to ask
                        you what you ultimately thought then of the movement of the whole CU
                        operation back over to USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I didn't like it at all. I thought it should stay separate. Well, you
                    know the reasons why people argued about it. I think as it turns out, it's not
                    nearly as bad as I had thought it would be.</p>
                <p>There have been some times after Charles Wick came in and thought that that side
                    of the program was not very useful, but even he came around to substantial
                    support. I think it worked out all right because there has been a kind of
                    separateness from propaganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that's always been — whether it's used as a
                        propaganda weapon rather than as an educational exchange, which is as it is
                        designated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: In some cases, it makes sense to do both. The Fulbright Program for China
                    makes sense, makes a great deal of sense, because it is sharply targeted toward
                    American studies, not to English teaching or scattering American professors in
                    economics or whatever around the Chinese universities. We have only a small
                    number, 20.</p>
                <p>They are all targeted toward building American studies institutions, and it has
                    been very, very successful. There are American Studies Departments in a lot of
                    Chinese universities. Now, if this is propaganda, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no resistance to this American Studies. When I
                        was in Iran, there was tremendous resistance to American Studies because
                        they felt that this was — they understood about studying about Europe, but
                        the minute you said American Studies, they were certain it was a
                        propaganda-organized project. The concept was not that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, this didn't occur in China, partly because of the euphoria on the
                    China side with the opening, the Chinese, Sino-American rapprochement matched
                    the euphoria in the United States and lots and lots of Chinese want to come
                    here, and still do. So, it was not tainted. There was no nationalistic
                    anti-American tinge, as you describe it in Iran.</p>
                <p>1965: Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), TaiwanWith Long Period as Charg�</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then in the States until 1965. Did you go back
                        overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: In '65, I went overseas. It was another State Department job. I was
                    Deputy Chief of Mission, DCM, in Taiwan. That was a great time because one
                    Ambassador, Admiral Wright, had already left. I took over from the previous DCM,
                    Ralph Clough. Walter McConaughy was supposed to come immediately. We had already
                    had an agr�ment from the Chinese government for him.</p>
                <p>Then the Indo-Pak War broke out and Walter McConaughy was Ambassador to Pakistan
                    and he was stuck in Pakistan for a solid year. This is the DCM's dream, to have
                    the Ambassador go away so the DCM can take over and do what he wants for a year;
                    that was great fun. I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It's an area that I knew a lot about. I met with Chiang Kai-shek and
                    Chiang Ching-kuo dozens of times on my own as the principal interlocutor. I
                    enjoyed it extremely and learned a lot from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on then in Taiwan? The Economic Assistance
                        Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Just finished in '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just finished?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It terminated in '65, but we still had extremely good relations and
                    Taiwan was already becoming a success story. I had the nice experience of being
                    temporarily a member of the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, JCRR,
                    which managed land reform in Taiwan. The basis for all of their economic
                    progress was that land reform.</p>
                <p>Politically, there were some strains. We had to continually restrain the Chinese
                    from doing silly things in relation to the mainland. It would be
                    counter-productive and wouldn't get anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this with vindictiveness, a sense of “we'll be back
                        there on the mainland”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: It was an article of faith at that time: “We are going back.” So, we had
                    to be sure that Americans, sometimes American organizations would not get
                    involved, particularly military. CIA was very good about all of this, but some
                    of our military outfits would insist on training the Chinese in small river boat
                    activities that could only be engaged then against the mainland.</p>
                <p>We would discover that the Chinese were about to do such and such and then I
                    would arrange todo such and such and then I would arrange to express our
                    displeasure before it happened, sometimes afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much influence did the madam have? She must have been
                        very strong while you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: A great deal. She had a great deal of influence, but not necessarily
                    decisive. Chiang Kai-shek himself had his own strong views and sometimes they
                    clashed; sometimes the two of them didn't agree.Chiang Ching-kuo was the Defense
                    Minister and, of course, even more powerful than an ordinary defense minister.
                    It was a very rewarding time to be there and I'm sure it was because Bill Bundy,
                    the Assistant Secretary for the area, thought that I handled the job reasonably
                    well, that he put me up immediately afterward to be Ambassador to
                    Burma.Discovering that I'd been in Burma and spoke some Burmese and liked the
                    place, why, he put me up for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was a very nice transition kind of
                        recognition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just ask you in a quick fashion, was there anything
                        special, over and beyond what we normally can read about, why Taiwan was
                        such a success? After all, they were almost the first to build on — I'm not
                        talking about the Europeans. Is it the old same kind of thing that makes the
                        Japanese so dedicated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Keys to Taiwan's Success Story: Cultural and Ethnic Traits of Chinese People</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Culturally, of course, as you can see in Singapore and Hong Kong and
                    elsewhere, when the Chinese are allowed to engage in free economic activity,
                    they are very hard working and very smart. It is on the mainland, where they
                    were told that they had to do things in a different way, that they stifled
                    individual productivity, the work ethic, all kinds of things in addition to the
                    political elements.In Taiwan, there was virtually no political freedom or very
                    limited political freedom, and this has been observed, that these great success
                    stories of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, all occur with very
                    limited political freedoms.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Land Reform in Taiwan</p>
                <p>The key to that Taiwan success is that, in addition to the ethnic traits and the
                    people that they brought with them from the mainland and Chinese in general want
                    to succeed, really, the land reform was the big key to it because the landlords
                    — and there were a lot of Taiwanese landlords — were paid off in bonds that they
                    could negotiate, sell, and did sell.</p>
                <p>Assuring that Main Economic Ventures Were Left to Native Taiwanese</p>
                <p>They established the businesses that are now the biggest businesses. Furthermore,
                    the officials told themselves they would not permit profiteering on the part of
                    mainlanders, so they left the economic business, the big, large-scale stuff, to
                    the Taiwanese so as not to make the same mistake they did on the mainland,
                    stifling enterprise, corruption and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did this wisdom come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: They had a series of very sensible and sober meetings to examine what
                    happened on the mainland. It has not been publicized very much but they decided
                    to keep their fingers off of the Taiwan economy, and they left it to local
                    people in an essentially noncorrupt fashion. The local people had the capital,
                    the wherewithal and the incentive to bring it up to do what needed to be done,
                    with American assistance and help.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, very pleasant. Even under the Ne Win government, it was still

                    glad to say, but I certainly saw a lot. I've seen them when I was on foot

                <p>Country's Economy in Shambles; Survives Only Because of Flourishing Black
                    Market</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Very closed. The country was essentially the way it is now, running as an
                    economic disaster and kept afloat only by a mammoth black market operation
                    across the border with Thailand for most of the spare parts, a lot of the
                    gasoline; all the essential things, medicines which the state system can't
                    supply come through the black market.By the same token, there is a terrible
                    drain on their natural resources. The gems and teak are smuggled out. They get
                    smuggled out and then, of course, there is the opium problem and the drug
                    problem which has now put most of the Shan State out of control of the
                    government. They have a continual civil war that's going on there between the
                    government forces and the opium growers and smugglers.</p>
                <p>Narcotics Problem - Hummel's Dealings with Ne Win on Issue</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>When narcotics was not yet high on our national agenda, I started, at my own
                    initiative, the first talks with Ne Win about trying to assist him in doing
                    something about the narcotics problem in Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the local population be using narcotics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, to some extent, yes. What brought Ne Win around was that his son
                    turned out to be a heroin addict later on. I didn't get very far in my first
                    conversations with him, but I at least opened the subject and eventually the
                    government decided they wanted to do things.It was directly related to their
                    insurgency. The insurgents were supporting themselves by the opium trade, so I
                    guess that was one of the high points, the official high points of the
                    place.Burma is not terribly consequential on the American horizon. If it were to
                    blow up or something, why then it would become so, or if the Chinese or somebody
                    else were to invade it, it would be. But, they've always had an anti-Soviet tilt
                    and, incidentally, a pro-Chinese tilt in spite of all the Chinese support for
                    their insurgencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a conference I went to on Burma, it talked about the
                        fact that at least the Burmese point of view was that because they are
                        essentially a Buddhist country, they don't mind the deprivations because it
                        is part of a reflection of their religion and the kind of life they lead and
                        what they hope to have in the future.Is that a straight out-and-out
                        propaganda statement or is this really the way the people think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think that's a propaganda statement if you are talking about the
                    intellectual life. If you are talking about the life of the peasant, the farmer,
                    in the small village, there is a lot of truth in that because their lifestyle is
                    adjustable, expandable and contractible in a very remarkable way.They live in an
                    exceedingly simple way. When they get a lot of money, they will spend it on the
                    temple, the Burmese pagoda, and on things like weddings and funerals. Their
                    material possessions are very, very meager and they know how to get along
                    without them.So, when the economy turns down on them, as it has, they just can't
                    give as much money to the pagoda and they can't have such lavish weddings and
                    funerals or other parties, name days and so on, but they can, because of their
                    lifestyle, which is certainly related to Buddhism, they can get along so that
                    the peasants — who live exceedingly simply — can always find enough to eat. It's
                    a lush country. They don't feel restive about the national economy turning
                    itself inside out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have the recent riots which they've been having,
                        intellectually, this does not discomfit them with the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Peasants Affected Relatively Little by Political Unrest, which is Largely
                    Confined to Cities</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: Not much among the farmers in the rural areas. Like almost all of this
                    restiveness, except maybe the Communist Chinese Revolution, which began in rural
                    areas, most of these other things happen in cities.What we saw in Burma was the
                    city people, everybody, workers, intellectuals, students, government officials,
                    even, standing up; virtually, the whole foreign ministry sent in their
                    resignations in Burma at one time.</p>
                <p>1971: Back to Department of State; Initially to Handle Micronesian (Trust
                    Territory) Negotiation</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After '71, then, you went —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I came back to Washington. To my horror, I was assigned by Marshall
                    Green, sold down the river, I thought, to set up an office to manage Micronesian
                    Status Negotiations, the Trust Territory in the Pacific Islands. I started from
                    scratch with no money, no office, no people, with negotiations three months
                    away, already scheduled, working for Hayden Williams, who was the Asia
                    Foundation Chief but also the designated negotiator. It was a real scramble.The
                    experience of traveling in the Trust Territories is great, but the bureaucratic
                    problems of trying to put together a negotiating stance with the Defense
                    Department bucking everything all the way, not willing to give up anything, and
                    even questioning the instructions we had gotten out of the White House, was a
                    tense business.I managed to escape from that. I came straight back from Burma, I
                    think, in July or June of '71 and immediately had to start finding money. The
                    Congress insisted that the State Department was not allowed to spend any money
                    on this, so I had to get donations from Interior and Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ultimately, it ended up in Interior.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, it did. Interior put up the office space and a little bit of the
                    money and a couple of</p>
                <p>people. The Defense Department put up other money. The State Department supplied
                    some people eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mary Vance Smith was —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: That's right. She came after me. I had the pleasure of having as my
                    deputy the present extraordinarily good Chief-of-Staff of the Armed Forces, Bill
                    Crowe, Admiral Crowe.</p>
                <p>February 1972: Escape Back to Mainstream: Deputy Assistant Secretary of State,

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I escaped from that back into the mainstream of the State Department to be a
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs in February '72
                    just at the time of the Nixon visit to Peking. I missed that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't go on any of those trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL:I went later on; in '73, I went with Henry Kissinger to Peking. By that
                    time, Henry had decided I was an okay guy and I sort of joined the inner circle
                    there as Deputy Assistant Secretary, for quite some time.I got bored with being
                    a perennial first deputy assistant secretary and volunteered to go to Ethiopia
                    in '75.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit more, however, about the development
                        of the China policy during this now historic period, the opening up of our
                        relations. Whose concept really was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It was Nixon's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes. He wrote an article in “Foreign Affairs” in '67. I reminded him
                    that two years before that, in '65, he visited Taiwan. I briefed him. He asked
                    for a meeting with the head of the embassy and I was charg� then.Actually Ralph
                    Clough was still there, my predecessor. The two of us went up to his hotel and
                    he clearly said — I was astounded, sitting there with the room bugged, quite
                    obviously. He quite clearly said that the United States was going to have to
                    work out a modus vivendi or detente with the Chinese communists. This was in
                    '65. Two years later, he wrote the “Foreign Affairs” article. By '71, he was
                    carrying it out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Great, an extraordinarily great facilitator; not just a facilitator, he
                    invented a lot of things and managed the whole thing very, very well. This is
                    one of Nixon's major accomplishments. However, he certainly deserved to be
                    kicked out of office.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: He's very strange, but right now, I think he's writing much more sensible
                    statesmanlike things than most other people are writing. He is a very
                    interesting person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was always interested because Kissinger, I always felt,
                        was essentially a European-oriented policy person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: He changed. He was European-oriented but in '71, the war between India
                    and Pakistan, when Bangladesh broke away, he was on top of that and took the
                    extraordinary step of sending an American aircraft carrier in to warn the
                    Indians not to destroy Pakistan completely.It was an interventionist idea and it
                    probably was quite a good one. I think, quite possibly, the Indians would have
                    taken advantage of the war to just destroy Pakistan once and for all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've never forgiven us, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: That's right. Of course, with his China, those are two non-European
                    initiatives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find him difficult to work with with that kind of
                        a reputation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes, extremely difficult. You just had to put up with all kinds of
                    abuse at all hours and unreasonable demands, but very stimulating. I enjoyed it
                    all. Henry, to this day, says that he likes to tell people, and he said this
                    when he used to visit me in Beijing when I was Ambassador and he was retired, he
                    used to say that I was mean to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I was mean to him, yes. I sometimes talked back to him in his office —
                    always privately, never grandstanding in front of a group, never at a staff
                    meeting. It was always in private, shouting at him, “You've got to listen. I'll
                    do it. I'll do what you say, but before you make the final decision, listen to
                    what I've got to say.”He'd say, “You're not loyal. You are disloyal. You're not
                    going to carry this out. I'm not going to rely on you.” I said, “Goddamit,
                    Henry, you can. If you tell me to do it, I'll do it, but I don't think it's the
                    smart thing to do. Here are the reasons why and would you kindly
                    listen?”Eagleburger was there once in a conversation, I think it was on an
                    airplane, when Henry made some profound statement. Larry likes to remember that
                    I just said, “Bullshit, Henry.” I'm proud of those things.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Well, that was exhilarating. It's partly because he didn't respect people
                    who didn't have their own ideas. He is an extraordinary intellect, very, very
                    stimulating.</p>

                <p>Establishment of U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I think one of the high points of this period when I was a Deputy was
                    when we managed to—actually, the Chinese in 1973 suggested or revived a
                    suggestion that was made in the Geneva talks, the Warsaw talks, long ago, to
                    have liaison offices; in the absence of diplomatic recognition, we had
                    diplomatic relations, completely unusual and really an unprecedented mechanism
                    then, the liaison office.I helped to organize it, staff it, make plans for our
                    people to go out. I didn't want to send Marines, but we sent Marines in the
                    first place and they got into trouble and had to be withdrawn.</p>

                <p>1975: Hummel Requests and is Made Ambassador to Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>Then I was out of the bureau because I went to Ethiopia. I enjoyed that very much
                    although relations were destined to go downhill, as I could see quite
                    easily.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: I volunteered to go because I was tired of being passed over to be

                    Bob Ingersoll, and then Phil Habib came in. Habib is one of my closest friends
                    and he was a better guy to choose than me, but I could see myself being the
                    perennial first deputy. It was time to go overseas again.</p>

                    across the conference table; he succeeded to leadership of Ethiopia by
                    assassinating his two superiors.</p>
                <p>After Somewhat Over One Year, Brought Back to Washington as Assistant Secretary
                    of State for East Asia and Pacific</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Direct action. I was saved from the debacle of our Ethiopian relations
                    which occurred later by Phil Habib asking me to come back and be Assistant
                    Secretary when Phil moved up to be Under Secretary for Political Affairs on the
                    seventh floor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No. The Asians themselves have so many different aspects to them. I mean,
                    the Malaysians are different from the Chinese and the Burmese are different from
                    anybody else; the Japanese are totally different.Ethiopia was just another
                    different culture, and I mean really alien, terribly tribal, very
                    underdeveloped, no notion of how to cooperate even though you disagree with
                    people. This was one of Selassie's great defects. He never established any kind
                    of parliament so they could have practice in something other than tribal
                    politics.If you disagree with someone, you shoot them, kill them. You are
                    enemies for life and a disagreement is sort of a way of life. Who is bigger? Am
                    I going to win or are you going to win?Zero sum games, always.</p>

                <p>Within Six Months a New Administration Takes Over: Hummel Replaced as Assistant
                    Secretary</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I came back to Washington. I came back in July and, by January, I was
                    out, because of the change in administration. Dick Holbrooke took my place. That
                    was a very interesting period, particularly after the elections.Between the
                    November elections when the Republicans lost and January, when the transition
                    occurred, we were fooling around with all kinds of fascinating things trying to
                    come to a quick agreement with the Philippines about the bases, warning Romulo,
                    which I did on Henry's instructions, that Carter was going to have a much dimmer
                    view of those bases, which was true. They had better make a deal with us before
                    Carter took office, trying to get this kind of thing done. It didn't
                    succeed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How disruptive is this, the switch which is going on even
                        now in the State Department, or has gone on, even though it's one Republican
                        administration to another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It is quite disruptive. It was terribly disruptive when the Kennedys took
                    over, when John Kennedy took over the White House. Any time there is a party
                    shift in the White House, there is a great tide. No matter what the President
                    wants, the people below him get into a mood of “Let's throw the rascals out and
                    let's have a complete change. We're going to do better and nothing you did is
                    worth examining.”It is not quite that bad now, but it is pretty bad. This is
                    mostly Baker's personal style, which is not conducive to teamwork and doesn't
                    want or solicit support from the professionals. They make their decisions in a
                    very small group.What you have read in the papers is all true. Morale is not
                    good. Then the excessive number of political ambassadors and other appointees
                    has a drastic impact on the FSO Corps because of the ripple effect: You can't
                    promote people because there aren't vacancies and so on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>1977: Phil Habib Assists Hummel in Becoming Ambassador to Pakistan</p>
                <p>You were only Assistant Secretary of State for a relatively short period of
                    time.</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Relatively short, seven months or something like that. Then I immediately
                    volunteered to go as Ambassador to the Philippines, but Romulo didn't like me at
                    all because of these negotiations and was dragging his feet.Then, all of a
                    sudden, George Vest, who had been scheduled to go to Pakistan, was drafted to be
                    Assistant Secretary, so Pakistan became vacant. Phil Habib called me up and
                    said, “How would you like to go to Pakistan instead of going to the
                    Philippines?”I called Betty Lou and we decided, “Okay.” Besides, the Philippines
                    was a mixed bag, particularly because of the differences between Imelda and
                    Ferdinand Marcos, not to mention Romulo. Bill Sullivan got into terrible
                    trouble, you know, with Imelda and his work was hampered by that.</p>
                <p>

                <p>HUMMEL: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this affect his decision making?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: No, I don't think so. He was very conscious of the fact that he was one
                    of the eldest statesmen in the world and that he was one of the founders of the
                    UN and so on, and he expected to be treated in a deferential way, which we did,
                    but he could be abrasive on his own, too. He was not senile in any way.</p>
                <p>Arrives Just in Time to See Bhutto Government Overthrown by Zia's Military
                    Coup</p>
                <p>So, I went off to Pakistan. Immediately thereafter, we had the coup, so no sooner
                    did I arrive and just barely met Bhutto than we had the military coup and Zia
                    took over.Then the following year, we had to terminate all aid programs because
                    of their nuclear purchases. We didn't get an aid program back until actually in
                    the Reagan Administration, so we had very little leverage there to accomplish
                    our own objectives.We had two main objectives in the beginning. One was
                    antinuclear proliferation and the other was narcotics control.</p>
                <p>

                    Pakistan in Face of Soviet Afghanistan Invasion</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes. This is the defect of Congressional legislation. As soon as you do
                    pull the trigger and suspend your aid, then you can no longer work towards your
                    own objectives. You don't have the wherewithal to do so and no country is going
                    to capitulate to western pressure.Then, of course, added to that, though, came
                    the countervailing factor of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan after which I
                    tried very hard to get an aid program going. I didn't make it. The Carter
                    Administration decided they would have a try but the size of the aid program did
                    not interest Zia. The price of making firm promises about nonproliferation,
                    about not pursuing their research program for nuclear weapons, the price was too
                    high, so that fell through.It wasn't until I caught A1 Haig's attention in the
                    very early days of the Reagan Administration that we put together an aid
                    program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Oh, yes. I had a lot of wrestling with John Glenn. We had the classic
                    case of competing priorities, of objectives that clashed. We wanted to support
                    Pakistan against the real Soviet threat, but we also had objectives like
                    nonproliferation and other things to balance these off.I was very — “upset” is
                    too strong a word. I was concerned that we did not do anything about the Soviet
                    Union's invasion of Afghanistan. We didn't go to the Olympics and we curtailed
                    our grain shipments to them, which hurt only our farmers, because the
                    Australians and the Canadians supplied them, and we didn't do anything more. We
                    were not supporting Pakistan against a very real, genuine threat.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Very shortly thereafter, they burned my embassy in Islamabad because somebody had
                    started a rumor — we never did figure out how this started — that the news from
                    Mecca, where unidentified, armed people had taken over control of the holy place
                    in Mecca, they started a rumor that this was really the work of Americans and
                    Israelis together who had attacked the holy place in Mecca.As soon as that rumor
                    went out, people began talking about it and people just got into buses and came
                    up and started to attack the embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really spontaneous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: That's right. The only organized part of it was that a couple of hundred
                    students from a nearby university were all ready with grappling hooks, ropes and
                    tin cans for gasoline, which is about all you need. A Palestinian-organized
                    group had already been planning something, so they took advantage of
                    this.Otherwise, the Pakistanis were terribly ashamed of themselves immediately
                    afterwards.Before long, I got checks totaling $24 million for the cost of
                    rebuilding the building.</p>

                <p>HUMMEL: A very gentlemanly person, very gentlemanly and surprisingly wily in
                    terms of politics. Bhutto had made him chief of staff of the army because he
                    thought he was a little bit dumb and compliant and he could be manipulated.
                    Bhutto brought it on himself in a real sense.The public disorder was out of
                    control, anti-Bhutto demonstrations, because Bhutto had rigged the election in

                    me that, of course, there is no question but that Bhutto was guilty of murdering
                    that person and of ordering the killing of a lot of other people: “This is the
                    way we expect our leaders to behave,” these people say. He should not have been

                    '60 even when we had no house. Now, a house helps a lot when you come back to
                    the same place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a home. It really is a home.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: It certainly helps the children to adjust to these changes.Anyway, to
                    wind this up, I guess —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working on China at all when the President was in
                        Peking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: When Bush was? Yes, oh, yes. I was the principal deputy in the East Asia
                    Bureau and I helped to brief him before he ever went out, and I saw him when he
                    came back. We have maintained a nice personal relationship ever since. I used to
                    drop in and see him whenever I came in from Pakistan or wherever in his vice
                    presidential office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He seems very much to have enjoyed that experience and he
                        learned a tremendous amount from it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, he did.</p>
                <p>1981: Ambassador to China</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in China from '81 to '85, following?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Following Leonard Woodcock and just prior to Winston Lord. I guess the
                    most important thing for me, of course, personally, was to be there at all as
                    Ambassador after having been born there and spent so much time studying
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>1981: Downturn in U.S.-Chinese Relations Due to Chinese Insistence on U.S.
                    Termination of Arms Sales to Taiwan</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Aside from that, the major event was when our relations — we had a complete cycle
                    of downturn and then revival. When I went out in the summer of '81, I did not
                    allow our agent to lease this house except with a Foreign Service clause for
                    cancellation right from the beginning.Normally, you give one year's grace but I
                    insisted no, because I thoroughly believed it was quite possible I would be
                    fired out of that job by the Reagan Administration because what they were
                    planning, in the White House, to do with Taiwan would have been so disruptive to
                    our PRC relations that I thought we might very well downgrade relations.The
                    Chinese knew about this. The tensions were very high already when I arrived.
                    They canceled a military visitor trip in the summer of '81 and, lo and behold, I
                    no sooner got there than the Chinese said the Americans had to set a date for
                    terminating arms sales to Taiwan; otherwise, relations would be downgraded. That
                    means sending Ambassadors home.It took 10 months of negotiations, and we finally
                    negotiated our way out of that, which is essentially almost a textbook case of
                    negotiations, of using all sorts of means and a lot of time to educate the
                    Chinese, that we would not, under any circumstances, set a date for terminating
                    arms sales. They had to help us find a mutually agreeable solution aside from
                    that.</p>
                <p>Then, relations began to take an upturn, but we still had an awful lot of trade
                    problems, defector problems, legal problems, all of which China raised in the
                    great heights of escalation, calling me in to listen to complaints from high
                    levels each time. It was really very- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the second tape, side one, of the Arthur Hummel
                        interview. We were just talking about the developments within China, the
                        nature of the negotiations which you had been carrying on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1982: Chinese Escalate Complaints over Trade Issues</p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Even after negotiations finished successfully, we still had a whole lot
                    of downers while the Chinese tried to test out how much we loved them by
                    escalating all these normal kinds of trade problems far beyond their importance,
                    far beyond the need to escalate them.</p>
                <p>Relations Improve: 1983 as U.S. Makes Trade Concessions</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Then we made the essential gesture — more than a gesture — of deciding that China
                    would have a higher status in our export licensing regime, where we would be
                    willing to license technology to them of a higher grade than we had been willing
                    to do before, something that the Carter administration had already promised them
                    but had been unable to accomplish because of bureaucratic obstructionism,
                    chiefly on the part of the Defense Department.When we did that in May of '83,
                    things began to turn for the better. Relations smoothed out and, of course,
                    President Reagan came for a visit. Vice President Bush had already been there.
                    The rhythm of mutual high level visits sort of solidified the friendly relations
                    that we still have.I think these high level visits are thought by some to be
                    frothy and inconsequential; I don't think so at all. I think the bureaucrats of
                    both countries take a cue from the events, and a whole lot of practical things
                    from ordinary business and trade all the way through government-to-government
                    negotiations are facilitated by the fact that both sides' bureaucrats understand
                    that's what they are meeting about.</p>
                <p>The Chinese as Negotiators: Sophisticated, Worldwise</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a couple of questions about negotiations before we
                        stop. I have seen you in action at the Aspen Institute Conference with the
                        Chinese and not only your fluency of language, but I was so impressed with
                        your understanding of their sense of humor.This is, after all, one of the
                        most critical elements of dealing across cultures in a different language.
                        Is this more critical in China than it is in other places? Did you find your
                        process of negotiation in China very different from, for instance, when you
                        dealt with Zia in Pakistan?After all, the Paks are much different kinds of
                        personalities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Yes, quite different. The Chinese are much more sophisticated. They
                    brought negotiation to a fine art. They have all kinds of instruments they bring
                    out, trying to pressure or shame you. Of course, they control the whole
                    environment so neatly that nobody leaks to the press Chinese information the way
                    they do on our side of the negotiations.</p>
                <p>If they want to seem stern, everybody is stern. They know how to indicate through
                    side talks — we had lots of side talks; that is, informal discussions, which is
                    where you get a lot of work done. They and we know how to signal what the
                    direction that the solution might be in or what somebody might be willing to
                    agree to.All of these methods, from pressure to inducement to getting into a
                    high dudgeon about things — the Chinese are experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've been at it for centuries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: They have, but the communists have added their own quirks, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It makes one wonder if somebody like a Leonard Woodcock —
                        obviously, he's done tremendous amounts of negotiation in his entire
                        background, but after all, no China particular —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I don't think you need to be China specific about negotiating with them.
                    You just have to be a damn clever negotiator. I don't think negotiating with the
                    Chinese really is different from anybody else.There are no particular cultural
                    taboos that you have to worry about like eating with your left hand. There is no
                    mysterious element. They are cosmopolitan, in a way, in terms of
                    negotiating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even the current communist group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Even more so in the current communist group. Having dealt with and
                    negotiated with so many different peoples around the world, they have developed
                    a standardized, world-wide style. Whatever is effective, they do, and they've
                    learned the kinds of things that might be effective.One virtue for me is that
                    sometimes when they were trying to use the technique of being terribly sad,
                    because it seems that I had just now gone back on a statement that I had made
                    two weeks before in previous negotiations and so on, I would just laugh at them
                    and say, “Oh, come on, you and I know this is the kind of trick that you use in
                    your negotiations and I am not impressed. I did not go back on what I said
                    before and even if I did, if I have new instructions from Washington, why should
                    you put on this dour face for me?” and so on.It helps a little bit to release
                    the atmosphere but it doesn't get you anywhere, really. Being a friend of China
                    has only one benefit. It doesn't get you a better deal from the Chinese
                    government. What it does is enable me to talk in a blunt and almost abrasive way
                    to the Chinese and get away with it, because they know that I'm not just trying
                    to impress my superiors. I'm really interested in helping with the substance of
                    the problem.That is the only benefit that being accorded the status of a friend
                    of China and being a diplomat gives you, but that's not inconsiderable. I can
                    tell them things about real American reactions: “Look, you'd really better watch
                    it because...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They believe you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: They believe me. They believe me and they are willing to accept critical
                    statements from me that might send them up the wall if somebody else made them.
                    These are some slight assets but that, with twenty-five cents, you can get a cup
                    of coffee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You resigned from the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>HUMMEL: Having passed 65 already, as soon as I left Peking, I retired at the end
                    of October, actually. My birthday was passed in June. You are supposed to retire
                    at 65, but as long as you are in a presidential appointment, you stay on. As
                    soon as the presidential appointment is finished, then you are out. By the way,
                    Leonard Woodcock was an excellent negotiator with the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His background was excellent in terms of
                        negotiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: That is what I meant to emphasize. Because there is nothing terribly
                    esoteric about negotiating with the Chinese, Leonard did it extremely well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was curious about the cultural element here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: The Chinese are so sophisticated that I suppose — I do know that in some
                    primitive cultures, you have to be extremely careful about various customs and
                    taboos. To some extent, you have to in China, too, but there are no tricks to
                    negotiating with the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you have had a fascinating and wonderful career. How
                        rewarding that you could achieve these highest elements within the
                        diplomatic world within your field of interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: I certainly have enjoyed it and to wind up in China was great. If you had
                    asked me what my most pleasant experiences have been, I would say in Burma,
                    strangely enough, but most professionally satisfying have been in China; that
                    was pleasant, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes I get the impression that Burma is almost a kind
                        of a dreamland rather than a reality.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HUMMEL: Everybody who has been stationed there sort of falls in love with the
                    place. It's rather strange.It has a terrible government, but lovely people.</p>
