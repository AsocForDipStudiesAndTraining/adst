                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was born in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on April 26, 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to register babies in Dhahran too back in 1958 to
                        1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: You were assigned there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was the consular officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, Peter; let's take your father's side. When and where did the Eichers come
                    from and what do you know about them?</p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, the Eichers have been in the United States since before the
                    American Revolution. My grandmother was a member of the Daughters of the
                    American Revolution and could trace our ancestry all the way back to St. Louis,
                    King Louis IX of France, as well as a king of the Netherlands. But she was a
                    Boyd, not an Eicher until she married, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the early Eichers doing in the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I'm not quite sure what they were all doing, actually. The best records
                    we have are on my grandmother's side, that's my father's mother, the Boyd
                    family. The first of my ancestors to reach America came to New York when it was
                    still New Amsterdam. They were Dutch. The Eichers came at a later point, I'm not
                    sure when or where. The Boyds came in the 1700's and eventually they made their
                    way to upstate New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about upstate New York. When is the first
                        time you are aware of what your grandparents or your great-grandparents or
                        great-great-grandparents were doing in upstate New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: You know, I'm not quite sure when I first became aware. I know that my
                    grandmother did proudly keep a handwritten book that showed the family history
                    generation by generation all the way back through these illustrious names that I
                    have dropped. If I recall correctly, it was a member of the Dutch royal house of
                    de Graff who traveled to New Amsterdam. I remember visiting the main cathedral
                    in Amsterdam once and finding a very old de Graff tomb there; perhaps it was a
                    member of the same family. But at some point a de Graff descendant in America
                    married a Boyd, which was my grandmother's family. It's her familthe Boydwho
                    were in upstate New York. They were originally a Scotch-Irish family and
                    immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1700s. One of the early Boyds was a private in
                    the New York militia during the American Revolution and later went on to be
                    state assemblyman, I think, and was involved in building the Erie Canal and I
                    think served as a weigh master on the Canal. As for the Eicher family, I'm not
                    sure exactly when or where they arrived in the U.S., although it also was before
                    the Revolution. The Eichers were Swiss-German and, I think, migrated to the U.S.
                    by way of Strasbourg, but I don't recall the circumstances; I believe we have it
                    in the family records somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you know about your grandparents on your father's
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: On my father's side my grandfather was a pharmaceutical chemist and he
                    lived in Chicago, although I believe he was born in South Dakota. I remember him
                    talking about the farm in South Dakota. After they moved to Chicago and he
                    became a chemist, he was, in fact, the first person to put cod liver oil into a
                    tablet, which I guess was rather revolutionary at the time. He was never a big
                    businessman but was a reasonably successful small businessman, with his own very
                    small factory making pills. He and his family did alright in the Depression,
                    since medicines are one of the last things people give up, even in hard times. I
                    remember liking his stories about when he was a boy, how motorcars were still so
                    rare that all the kids would run down the street to see whenever one passed. He
                    also talked about going out to the shores of Lake Michigan to see the first
                    airplanes fly over. I used to think that was strange and amusing, and now I find
                    myself doing the same sort of thing with my grandchildretelling them about the
                    days when we didn't have computers, video players, and such, and telling them
                    about watching on TV when the first man landed on the moon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your grandfather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That is my grandfather I've been talking about. My father was an oilman,
                    a petroleum geologist and micro-paleontologist, hence the assignment in Dhahran.
                    He was working for ARAMCO (the Arabia-American Oil Company) at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part of the oil business was he in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: He was a geologist, involved in exploration for oil. He spent many years
                    in the Middle East. He was looking for oil in the Middle East, especially in
                    Egypt and the Sahara. During World War II, he was exploring for oil in the
                    Middle East. He was exempted from the army because they thought his work looking
                    for oil was more important for the war effort than serving as an infantryman
                    would have been. He was working for ESSO and then went to ARAMCO, which I think
                    was associated with ESSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Middle East play much of a role in the stories in
                        the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Oh yes. You haven't asked me about my mother's side yet.</p>
                <p>She was of Egyptian nationality and was part of a Sephardic Jewish family that
                    has both Spanish and Italian heritage. Her family was part of the huge community
                    of Jews and other non-Arabs that lived in Egypt, and particularly in Alexandria,
                    at that point. She worked with the British Armas a secretary, I thinduring the
                    War. I remember her stories of Cairo being bombed and of being able to hear the
                    guns during the Battle of El Alamein. She and my father met there not long after
                    the War and were married in Egypt in 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sephardic Jews, how did they get started in
                        Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We don't have good family records on that side, perhaps in part because
                    much of the family was in Europe and died in the Holocaust. My mother's farther
                    was one of 13 children, I believe, and her mother was one of 11 children, so
                    we're talking very large families, many of whom didn't survive, particularly on
                    my grandfather's side. In term of how they got to Egypt, I believe if may go
                    back to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain around 1492. I don't know where the
                    family really came from that long ago. My grandfather did have a Spanish last
                    namErrera. He himself was from Thessalonica, which at the time was part of the
                    Ottoman Empire, and he was a relatively recent immigrant to Egypt from there. My
                    grandmother's family was the Naggiars, a fairly prominent family in the Jewish
                    community in Egypt, who had been there for I don't know how many
                    generations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the status of the Jewish community at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>EICHER: There was a big Jewish community in Egypt, especially in Alexandria. It
                    was part of a quite a cosmopolitan group. Alexandria at the time had huge
                    communities of Greeks and Italians and others as well, a very cosmopolitan city.
                    The foreign communities, and in particular the Jews, did not leave in large
                    numbers until after Nasser took over.</p>
                <p>So, I come from this background which on one side is Daughters of the American
                    Revolution/Presbyterian and on the other side and a first generation Egyptian
                    Jewish immigrant. And, of course, there are lots of other nationalities mixed
                    in. If you scratch me, I'll bleed almost every country in Europe and the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your mother's parents up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: My grandfather on my mother's side, Moise Errera, was a cotton broker but
                    I can't say that I know a lot more than that about his background or his work.
                    They were certainly not religious Jews, and even sent my mother to Catholic
                    schools when she was little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take your mother. What sort of schooling did she
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: She went to, I don't know, I guess it must been private schools in
                    Alexandria as she was growing up. At that time, the good private schools in
                    Egypt were still French language schools. French was her first language and the
                    language her parents spoke at home, although they were of Spanish and Italian
                    ancestry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: She did go to university in Alexandria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father, what sort of education did he have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: He went to university as well. He did geology and micropaleontology at
                    the University of Chicago and got a master's degree in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Dhahran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: For about a year and, of course, I don't remember it. My parents really
                    did not like Saudi Arabia very much. At the time, Dhahran was really very much
                    just an oil camp and they were looking to get out so they left as soon as they
                    could.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of life was it for them? Did they talk about it
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: You know, I think it was the kind of life which might not have been very
                    different from embassy life on an isolated compound some place. They were out in
                    the middle of the desert. There was a group of people out there working in
                    exploration and production, living in what I sense from old family pictures were
                    very small, neat houses and kind of a landscape that you would be familiar with
                    out on the coast of Saudi Arabia. From what I've been told, it was a very quiet
                    kind of existence and probably tough. You know, the climate was tough, the
                    isolation was tough and there was certainly very, very little to do. I remember
                    my mother complaining that they used to blow the whistle for the men to go to
                    work and come home, which used to be a big irritation to my dad, who of course
                    was a professional, as were most of the people there were, and it wasn't as if
                    they were punching in at a factory, so they wondered why there had to be a
                    whistle for them to come to work in the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your parents go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: After that they went back to New York. I can't remember when he switched
                    to which oil company because I was so young at the time but he worked with an
                    oil company in New York for a little while. We lived in the New York
                    suburbHartsdale and Bronxvillfor a couple of years and then went back to Egypt.
                    He was assigned back to Egypt for more exploration work there so we lived in
                    Cairo and Alexandria for a few years. He actually switched to Conoco at some
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall Egypt at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I do recall it a little bit. I left when I was six so it was more
                    impressions than serious memories. But I do remember some incidents, and places,
                    and people and smells and tastes. I started school there, at a British school.
                    In fact, I was later assigned to Egypt as one of my Foreign Service posts and
                    although I had not been there for thirty years, there were more things that were
                    familiar that I expected. I even remember walking around Alexandria with my wife
                    and when we came to one neighborhood I said “boy, this is familiar.” I checked
                    later with my parents and found that it was the neighborhood where we lived. I
                    left Egypt in 1956, during the Suez crisis, when I was only six years old. We
                    were evacuated, along with the rest of the American community. I was pulled out
                    of school one day and put on a very crowded ship with the rest of my family and
                    lots of other people. We didn't have a cabin and I shared a sofa in one of the
                    lounges with my brother as a bed. We sailed away and were met in the
                    Mediterranean by the U.S. Sixth Fleet. It seemed like an adventure. And, as I
                    said, I wouldn't see Egypt again for 30 years. My mother's family was still
                    there when we left, but most of them would also leave within the next few
                    years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Then Houston, Texas for five years, another oil town, of course, company
                    headquarters. It was my chance to become an American, to grow up in a regular
                    American town, go to an American elementary school, and to get to be a Texan. I
                    spent most of elementary school there; we stayed five years. From there we moved
                    to Paris, France. My father was still working with Conoco, which was doing
                    exploration mainly in Senegal and Mauritania so he would spend a lot of time
                    traveling down there but based out of Paris. I suppose that was the most
                    comfortable place to live when exploring for oil in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Houston. What do you think of
                        Houston?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was where I spent my elementary school years, so its not as if I had a
                    deep knowledge of the place. For me, it was nice, a good childhood. There was a
                    pleasant school, baseball games, friends, neighborhoods, and bicycles,
                    television, and everything that goes with an American childhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I don't think that I was an enormous reader but I guess I was always a
                    reader. I liked reading. I started with comic books and moved up through
                    novels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In elementary school was there sort of a series of books
                        that sort of impressed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, you know, I was certainly reading a lot of Hardy Boy books and
                    things of that kind. I think there were also a lot of simple history type books
                    that I used to read. There was one series called Landmark Books that I remember
                    reading several of, that were simple biographies or maybe history stories of the
                    Texas Rangers or the American Revolution or things like that. Eventually I moved
                    on up to adult books, maybe starting with Agatha Christie. I can't remember at
                    what age I might've picked up what. I do remember that I was reading real adult
                    novels by the time we arrived in Paris, which would have been sixth grade.
                    Exodus is the first fat book I remember reading.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>EICHER: I was a pretty good student. I didn't tend to be first in the class but I
                    was up there among the bright students, if you will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home, did you have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I have one brother who is about 16 months older than me, so we were
                    always pretty close. Since we moved around a lot, I always had a companion who
                    was about my age. We tended to like the same things and do things together quite
                    a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother give you much of a taste of Egypt and that
                        part of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, not all that much on a day to day basis, but a certain amount was
                    always there. I think her philosophy was with that she wanted us to be real
                    Americans and to fit in with the American kids. So, for example, we always spoke
                    English at home, even though French was her native language. You know, if you
                    were living in Houston, Texas as an elementary school student in the 1950s and
                    you were speaking some language other than English at home, then people would
                    have thought you were a little weird. I think she very much wanted to avoid that
                    and so there was probably less emphasis on the foreign side of the family than
                    there might have been. But, of course, I did know that I had a lot of foreign
                    relatives. I did speak a little bit of French because when we saw the relatives
                    we would speak to them in French. So I first learned French the same way I
                    learned English, by speaking it, not by taking lessons. But since we didn't
                    speak it at home, it was never great French, just passable, with lots of
                    mistakes and a heavy American accent. In retrospect, as a Foreign Service
                    officer I sometimes looked back and thought that it would have been nice to have
                    spoken more French at home so that my French would have been much better. But
                    that was in retrospect; it certainly wasn't something I wanted to do at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The family didn't speak Arabic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not Arabic at home, no. I'm not even sure they spoke fluent Arabic
                    although they certainly knew some. They were very much European Egyptians,
                    although they were Egyptian nationality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alexandria was quite a unique place, the society

                </p>
                <p>Did any elementary teachers sort of stick out?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>EICHER: You know, I could probably remember most of the names my teachers in
                    Texas but I can't remember much about them really. I do remember in retrospect,
                    you know, it was very much the era of segregation and even though it was a
                    public school, it was a white school. I do have a memory of my third grade
                    teacher railing against integration at one point, saying the way things were
                    going we were all going to be chocolate-colored and she was certainly glad that
                    she would be dead and gone by that time. As in all of the South, there were
                    still separate facilities, for example, white and “colored” water fountains. In
                    fact, I have an early memory of being with my brother at a supermarket and
                    seeing the two water fountains and flipping on the colored one and being
                    surprised that it wasn't colored water coming out of it. I guess that shows we
                    weren't too keenly aware at that stage about racial segregation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Houston and go back to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: To Paris. That was 1961.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were about eleven years old.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was just in the early weeks of sixth grade so I was eleven years
                    old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school? How long were you in
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: About two and a half years. I went to school first at the English School
                    of Paris because there was no room at the American School that year. The next
                    year I transferred to the American School for seventh grade. I stayed there for
                    a year and a half before the next move. It was a beautiful school, out in
                    Louveciennes, a suburb of Paris. The school was set in a couple of old chateaus,
                    really quite a place to go to school. One of them was the DuBarry pavilion,
                    where Mme DuBarry, Louis XV's mistress, did her entertaining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was really very, very nice. We lived in downtown Paris. We very much
                    enjoyed the freedom of the city, we could take the metro and bus by ourselves,
                    wander the streets by ourselves, go to movies, museums, wander the Champs
                    Elysee, find the bowling alleys or whatever, you know, that we wanted to do. We
                    spoke enough French to get around quite easily and enjoyed Paris life very much.
                    We had a lot of good friends, of course mainly Americans because we were going
                    to the American school. I should mention that I met my wife there. She was in my
                    class at the American school for the second half of seventh grade and the first
                    half of eighth grade. We didn't know each other well, but it was a small school
                    so everyone knew everyone else a bit. Our older brothers ended up being good
                    friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were no particular constraints about wandering around
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: None at all. There were a few terrorist attacks there at the time, as
                    Algeria was seeking its independence. De Gaulle was president of France. I
                    didn't understand a lot of what was going on politically at that time. I guess I
                    didn't pay much attention to it at the age I was when I got there. There were a
                    couple of bomb blasts in town including one at the American drugstore right on
                    the Champs Elysee which got a lot of publicity and I guess even more publicity
                    here in the United States, perhaps. People might call from the U.S. and say,
                    “Are you okay?” as they tend to do when they hear about anything that goes wrong
                    in a country when you are assigned there. But basically, it was a safe city at
                    the time, at least in the neighborhoods we hung out in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much intermingling with the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Extremely little. Not as a matter of policy but just because we didn't.
                    We went to the American School, so we had American friends. There were a few
                    French kids at school who we might get to know who, for whatever reason, had
                    been put there by their parents to learn English or whatever. Some of the
                    American kids, like me, hadn't been able to get into the American School when
                    they first arrived and were put on a waiting list but unlike me, some had gone
                    to a French school for a year rather than a British school and so they had some
                    French friends. I got to know a few of them a little bit but generally, not very
                    much. We also had a few French friends through family connections but with a
                    couple of exceptions they don't really stand out as people we spent a lot of
                    time with. So, it was I suppose in some ways it was very exotic and cultured to
                    be growing up in Paris and be exposed to so many European things. In other ways,
                    it was probably very much like any twelve year old growing up in a big city
                    anyplace else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were about fourteen when you left there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>EICHER: Thirteen. We left there at the beginning of 1964 and moved to London,
                    which was another company headquarters in Europe. I can't recall what may have
                    been the business reason for my father's move from Paris to London. We were
                    very, very sorry to leave Paris, of course. It was a nice life, a lot of good
                    friends, a nice city to be in. We were always sad to leave the places we
                    lived.</p>
                <p>London turned out to be a wonderful place, of course. It's a great city. At that
                    time it was the kind of city you could be safe wandering almost anyplace. There
                    was a lot to do, all kinds of things going on. The music scene was very activit
                    was just the time that I was getting into pop music and so fortand of course
                    London was the place at the time. It was the time of the “British invasion,”
                    when all the most popular rock music was coming from England. We actually lived
                    in a small apartment building where two of the Beatles were living when they
                    were just getting started. It was our temporary place when we first moved to
                    London and where we lived for three or four months while we looked for permanent
                    housing. George and Ringo were living in the apartment directly upstairs from
                    us. There were only six or seven flats in the building. There would be girls
                    outside screaming. It was kind of a fun experience. And heady, especially for a
                    13 or 14-year-old. The two Beatles didn't stay long once the fans discovered
                    they were living there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in London how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Two and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you going to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Although there was an American School of London right in town, the school
                    that was recommended as the place to go was actually the American Air Force
                    school, which was out in the distant suburbs of London. That didn't have room
                    when I got there, so I was on a waiting list for the last half of my eighth
                    grade year. I went to a couple of little British schools which they called
                    “tutorial schools,” which, I think, I don't know quite how or why they existed,
                    but they did seem to cater to people who were going to be there a very short
                    time and had very small classes of five or six people. They would try to give
                    you individual attention, so it was okay. It gave me a lot of exposure to real
                    British things, British history and British ways of doing things, which I had
                    already encountered for most of a year at the English School of Paris. I was in
                    the tutorial schools only for a few months and then as I started ninth grade,
                    high school, I was able to transfer out to the American Air Force school, which
                    was called Central High School at that point.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, that was good fun. I was there as a teenager. High school was fun
                    in London. It was a very long bus ride out to the school out in the suburbs, so
                    some of the best friends we made were the other kids who rode the bus with us. I
                    think we did more than an hour each direction on the bus every day from downtown
                    London out to the school but once you got there it was very much a little piece
                    of America. In a way, it looked like a lot of the American military bases in
                    Europe. It still had lots of Quonset huts built to last through the end of World
                    War II, but they were still there being used for one thing or another, in this
                    case, as a school. They had a new gym and football teams and student councils
                    and all kinds of normal American school activities.</p>

                <p>EICHER: I think it came out pretty well. You know, it was kind of a
                    conglomeration that wasn't necessarily as logical a progression as it would have
                    been for somebody who went through the same school system all their life.
                    Changing schools every year or two, I was probably missing some structure and
                    probably missed some topics completely as a result. On the other hand, I
                    probably picked up a lot of things that I would not have picked up in a standard
                    American school system, particularly with my stints at the English School of
                    Paris and another half-year at the English schools in England. During those
                    years, I kept hearing 1066 is the most important year to remember, rather than
                    1492. I mean, those kinds of things, and lots of stories of king this and king
                    that and our proud British heritage, in a way that I might not have gotten at
                    all otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you and your brother get much chance to talk about
                        current events and what was happening around the dinner table and that sort
                        of thing or not at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think we did. We were a family who did sit and have dinner together and
                    that was partly because we were in Europe and there weren't the TV shows on
                    there like in the States. Eating dinner with the family I guess we talked partly
                    about what happened to us during the day, but it seems to me my folks were
                    always interested in world affairs and that there were probably a lot of things
                    going on in the world that we talked about. I would be hard pressed maybe to
                    come up with a lot of specific conversations and topics that we talked about but
                    certainly, I remember discussions of de Gaulle and even Macarios and the British
                    politicians of the time, Wilson and Heath, and others who were in power then,
                    not to mention things that were going on in the States as well, which must have
                    come up. We used to get the New York Herald Tribune, and I remember reading
                    that. At first, when we got to Paris, I was mainly interested in the comics, but
                    over the years I started reading more of the paper. Even back in Houston, I
                    remember watching the Kennedy-Nixon debates on television. I remember, where I
                    was when I heard Kennedy was assassinatedoing my homework one night in Paris. By
                    the time we left London, the Vietnam War was already becoming an issue. I
                    remember some discussions at home about that, as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Very little, that I remember. Not long after 1956, when most of the
                    foreigners left Egypt, most of my mother's family left also. I can't remember
                    exactly what years. Most of them, had or managed to get Italian passports and
                    left for Europe. There were also quite a few who already lived in France. In
                    fact, when we were living in Paris there was quite a number of my mother's
                    relatives there. A few ended up in Switzerland as well. So, there was a big
                    group of relatives with Egyptian connections scattered around Europe and in that
                    context every once in a while there would be conversations about Egypt primarily
                    but very little about Israel. My mother's brother moved to Israel but as far as
                    I know he was the only member of the family who did and my mother did not stay
                    in touch with him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, we knew it existed, of course. It intruded very little in our
                    affairs. I seem to remember going to the embassies and in London certainly, in
                    Paris probably. It must have been to get passports renewed or to get new
                    passports or something like that. Aside from that, I'm not sure we had any
                    direct contact with the embassies. But, of course, we had a lot of friends at
                    school whose parents were working for the embassy, so we knew lots of embassy
                    kids as well as oil company kids and others. The embassy kids seemed privileged
                    because they could use the PX and get real American stuff, unlike us company
                    kids who had to live off the local market. It would be a little treat to join
                    the embassy kids or the military kids to get hamburgers in both London and
                    Paris. There were actually places right downtown in both cities, as well as out
                    in the bases in the suburbs, with embassy clubs or officers clubs. I'm not quite
                    sure what they were, but you could go and get a hamburger, etcetera there if you
                    had a pass, which the embassy kids did. You couldn't do it on the local market;
                    there weren't any McDonald's or anything like that at that point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cold War when you were a kid, was it an
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>EICHER: I guess it was. I grew up at the time when we used to have air raid
                    drills in elementary school. I can't remember how often, you know, once a month
                    or once a week or whatever. The teachers would tell you to get down on your
                    knees underneath your little desk and tuck your head between your knees so that
                    when the atomic blast went off you couldn't see it and you wouldn't be hurt by
                    flying glass. In retrospect it seems a little comical, as if crouching under
                    your desk would protect you from an atomic blast. There were events like the
                    Cuban missile crisis and Khrushchev banging his shoe that I remember hearing
                    about as they happened, although I don't recall that they affected my life very
                    much at the time. I remember the beginnings of the space race, of course. For
                    the first few launches of American astronauts they let us out of class in
                    elementary school to watch the blast-offs. You know, I can remember odds and
                    ends but not really a great coherent saga of the Cold War. Of course, I became
                    more and more aware when we were in Europe and I grew older. By the time I was
                    in high school, I was certainly well aware of the Cold War and international
                    developments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left London when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It would have been 1966, after my sophomore year of high school. We moved
                    back to the States. My father was transferred back to New York headquarters. We
                    ended up living in Connecticut</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you live in Connecticut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We lived in Westport, Connecticut, which was an hour's train ride from
                    New York, so it was a long commute for my father. I went to the public high
                    school there which was very good and finished up my high school. My mother
                    worked as a French teacher at a local private school. My brother went off to
                    college, so I was the only child at home for the first time. By coincidence, my
                    wife-to-be, who had been in my junior high class in Paris, had also moved to
                    Westport and was in high school with me there. That's where we finally got
                    together; I married my high school sweetheart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Westport like? Was this a commuter town or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was pretty much a commuter town and it was already a pretty prominent
                    upper class commuter town. Generally, the closer you went to New York, the more
                    the real estate prices went up. In Greenwich and Darien, where the commute was
                    shorter, the prices were higher. Westport at the time was probably near the
                    outer limits of how far most people wanted to commute. It was already a very
                    nice place to be. There were a few movie or TV stars living there. Paul Newman
                    lived in a big place very close to where our house was. At that time, Westport
                    was also still a town where there were a lot of people who had grown up there
                    and there were some less well off parts of town, but certainly not poor.
                    Nowadays, I understand you can't look at a house in Westport for less than a
                    million dollars. I get back there from time to time. My dad is buried there so I
                    occasionally go back when I visit my mother and brother who live in New
                    Haven.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: In 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1968, how did Vietnam play, first for your family and
                        then in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It played big-time. I mean, it was right at the time of big military
                    buildups and national protests. 1968, of course, was the big presidential
                    campaign where Johnson dropped out and there was the McCarthy movement against
                    the war. We ended up with Humphrey running against Nixon, so it was a big
                    political year. It was also, of course, the year that Martin Luther King and
                    Bobby Kennedy were assassinated. I remember being activist enough already to
                    have helped organize little protests, memorial sit-ins on the school green after
                    those assassinations and participating in those. My brother, who was two grades
                    ahead of me, was already very much worried about the draft and he was really
                    coming down very strongly on the antiwar side of things for personal and
                    philosophical reasons. I know his views helped influence mine. I initially got a
                    college deferment, but those were soon ended. While I was in college, the draft
                    changed to the lottery system. I drew number 340, so I was safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the high school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was a big, suburban high school, in my view a very big high school.
                    There were probably about 600 kids in each grade, grades ten through twelve,
                    which was huge compared to the schools I have been going to overseas. The Paris
                    school class had maybe fifty people and now I was in a class of 600, so that was
                    enormous. The school was spread out on a big campus much like the Foreign
                    Service Institute. It was very active and a lot of things were going on:
                    football games, dances, proms. Since Westport was an artsy town and people had
                    connections, there seemed to be a lot of big performers who would come perform
                    even at the high school auditorium. We had people like Louis Armstrong and also
                    got a lot of big pop and rock acts of the time, the Young Rascals, Cream, and
                    Pete Seeger. It seemed unusual to get this sort of people to come to a high
                    school. Adjusting to a school in the States after being overseas is harder than
                    the other way around. At overseas schools, almost all the kids are moving around
                    every couple of years and they come from lots of different places and
                    backgrounds, so it's easier to fit in. In the States, you're more likely to run
                    into established groups of friends who are less open to newcomers. As it turned
                    out, I did fine. I found a group of friends, partly through my wife-to-be, who
                    had already been in the school for a year when I got there. I joined the Service
                    Club, which got me involved in a lot of activities, and was elected president of
                    the club in my senior year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fall politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, my father came from a long line of Republicans. He was a Republican
                    and his father was a Republican. I guess through the Depression his father was
                    very much one of the anti-Roosevelt people. My dad was on the liberal end of the
                    Republican spectrum, more of a Rockefeller Republican. My mother always
                    supported the Democrats and, you know, they would joke that they would cancel
                    each other's votes when they went to the polls. Eventually, my dad started
                    voting democratic, as well. I think he grew disillusioned with the Nixon
                    administration. Also, with his kids supporting the Democrats, he grew
                    philosophical and thought that since it would soon be our world, he would
                    support the path we were supporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know what you were going to do when you went to
                        college? Did you have an idea of what your career would be? How did that
                        work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>EICHER: I didn't know for sure. I had already started thinking about the Foreign
                    Service, although I didn't know very much about it in a practical sense. Having
                    grown up moving around all the time, something international appealed to me a
                    lot. I wanted to continue to move and to see the world. So, I guess it was in my
                    mind that the Foreign Service could be a career, or something else that would
                    take me out to see the world and have more international adventures. I was
                    already thinking that way when I went to college. I went to McGill University in
                    Canada and part of the reason was that it was different, in a way from U.S.
                    universities. I was practically at home but at the same time I was in another
                    country, a French speaking city, and it made it seem more exciting to me. Canada
                    was also a good place to be heading in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you particularly in Canada because of the draft?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, because as I told you I had an exemption and when I left for Canada,
                    I could've expected to have an exemption for the rest of my college career; the
                    lottery came a bit later. It was certainly in my mind, however, that Canada
                    wouldn't be a bad place to be if the situation didn't improve at home and the
                    war continued over the long term. I had been looking mainly at city schools on
                    the East Coast and applied to a number of them and actually went to visit McGill
                    in Montr�al and really fell in love with the city and thought it would be a good
                    school. It had a reputation at the time as “the Harvard of Canada” so it was
                    well regarded academically. It was also far, far cheaper than American schools
                    of the same quality. That was particularly important since I was married right
                    out of high school to my high school sweetheart, Stephanie. The Canadian
                    government subsidized my education, as they did at the time for all students.
                    Later, they boosted the fees for foreign students, but I was gone by then. So,
                    the exotic elemennot that Montr�al was so wildly exotic, but exotic compared to
                    American citiethe price, and my attraction to the city, all contributed to the
                    decision to attend McGill, as well as the knowledge that it would be a good,
                    safe place to be if the war was still an issue when I graduated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was interesting times. Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the young,
                    flamboyant prime minister who was making headlines all over the world and he was
                    fun to watch. In Qu�bec province where we were, of course, they had the big
                    separatist movement going on; the Parti Qu�becois was probably close to its peak
                    at that point and it looked like there was a quite a chance that Qu�bec might
                    head toward independence. There was even a violent separatist movement that
                    undertook some bombings and kidnappings.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that affect the campus much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, you know, it was an activist campus. It was the late 1960s and
                    early '70s; sit-ins were fun. It was kind of what you did. McGill, of course,
                    was an English university in Qu�bec and so it stood to be affected by all of
                    this but as an institution it was not a proponent of separatism, certainly. On
                    the contrary, it was part of the English establishment. It was even a target.
                    There was at least one bombing right on campus while we were there about a block
                    from our apartment. I remember hearing the blast and everybody going out to look
                    and see what had happened, which is, I guess, what we did in those days; you
                    hear a blast and go to it rather than hunker down, as you're advised to do
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that the students, I would think
                        that the students in Canada were looking over their shoulders and seeing the
                        American students having fun raising hell on campuses and they didn't have
                        the same issues to protest. Were they kind of looking around for issues or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I suppose there was certainly some of that. Yes, I think Canadian
                    campuses were caught up in the same kind of spirit of a new generation of
                    protest that went with the '60s, as was the case in France and other countries
                    not involved in Vietnam. You would have an occasional antiwar rally but it
                    wasn't the same kind of intensity there as in the United States. There were also
                    quite a lot of Americans at McGill who ended up there for one reason or another;
                    some certainly to avoid the draft. In fact, we knew a few who had come up just
                    specifically because their draft number was up and they chose to leave rather
                    than go to Vietnam. It was quite sad in some cases. Some of them really broke
                    with their families over their decision to come to Canada and it made very tough
                    times for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any, at the university, were any efforts made
                        to take the people who defected back to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No. Not that I'm aware of in any case. Canada was pretty much a safe
                    haven. Getting permission to stay in Canada as a permanent resident wasn't
                    necessarily a sure thing. There was a complicated system to apply and be
                    accepted. At the same time, I don't think they were forcibly sending anybody
                    back who was there to avoid the draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any taste of the, I used to call it the
                        syndrome from about half the people who served in Canada, about the
                        Canadians being annoyed at the Americans because Americans don't pay much
                        attention to Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>EICHER: You certainly got that feeling. You know, there was a constant sense of
                    sleeping next to an elephant, as they used to say. It didn't make much
                    difference to Americans what happened in Canada one way or the other. On the
                    other hand, every time we sneezed, it affected Canada in big ways. You know,
                    that was just clearly an underlying element of the national culture that they
                    had to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any professors who were, particularly at the

                        all that or did that translate itself or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not so much, no. I think everyone was anti-waI don't remember any
                    professor who wasn'but I don't think that translated itself into
                    anti-Americanism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about McGill and what were you picking up about being
                        at an English university in the middle of a French-speaking place and this
                        was the time, as you said before, Francophones and all that, I mean
                        separatism. Did that translate itself to the campus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It did. There were official efforts to be sensitive to what was going on
                    elsewhere in Qu�bec. In fact, I think I was part of the last class that went
                    through McGill in four years. Starting with the next year after me, the
                    university changed to a five-year program designed to give the students more
                    French and to tie in better with the Francophone elements of Qu�bec's
                    educational system. So, in fact, McGill may not have been a very attractive
                    choice to me if I had not gone the year that I went. I wasn't looking for an
                    extra year in university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated in what, 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: In 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>EICHER: By that point I was certainly pointed towards an international career and
                    probably the Foreign Service was at the top of my list; by that point, it
                    certainly was. I did first go back for a year of graduate school in the United
                    States. I went to the University of Pennsylvania for a year of international
                    relations. I had done history and political science at McGill. I thought that,
                    first of all, I would be better off with a master's degree than just a BA, and
                    second of all, it would be a good idea to have an American degree as well as a
                    Canadian one. I wanted to limit the program to one year, in part because I
                    needed to get a job and an income. I was still married, of course, and had one
                    son who was born in Canada. The University of Pennsylvania was one of very, very
                    few schools that were actually giving a master's degree in one year. I figured,
                    you know, who's going to frown at my Ivy League master's degree because I got it
                    in one year instead of two? Little did I know that when I joined the Foreign
                    Service, they paid me less because I had a one-year master's than if I had had a
                    two-year master's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Honest to God?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Honest to God. When I joined, with a one-year master's degree, I came in
                    at the whopping salary of nine thousand and some dollars; less than ten
                    thousand. People with only a BA came in at a slightly lower salary and people
                    with a two year master's at a slightly higher one. Still, that was a lot of
                    money to me. I think I passed the $10,000 mark when I got a couple of step
                    increases for testing out of French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1974? When did you take the Foreign Service oral and
                        written exams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I took the written exam in the fall of 1972. There were hundreds of
                    people taking the test in Philadelphia at a big school. It was an all day exam,
                    in several sections. Most of it was multiple choice, with sections on English,
                    as well as a general knowledge section that was kind of fun. And there was at
                    least one essay question. There was a heavier emphasis on English and writing
                    than I expected, which turned out to be good for me, since I did well on that
                    part. At the time, people taking the test had to choose what specialty, or in
                    Foreign Service terms which “cone,” they wanted to test in, and one of the
                    sections of the test was targeted to the particular cone you chose. In essence,
                    therefore, you were only competing against other people who chose the same cone.
                    I chose political, because it was far and away of the most interest to me,
                    although you were warned that some cones required higher scores than others to
                    pass, and political was said to be the hardest. Still, I squeaked through and
                    got a letter a few weeks later saying I had passed and inviting me to take the
                    oral exam.</p>
                <p>I took the oral in 1973, the beginning of 1973, while I was still a graduate
                    student at Penn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions or how the exam was
                        constituted?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>EICHER: I certainly remember how it was set up. I remember taking the train down
                    from Philadelphia to Washington to take the test. It seems to me you had an
                    essay to write first of all, and then they took each of us separately into a
                    little room with three examiners. I sat there with them for about an hour or so
                    and they fired off various kinds of questions focusing very heavily on foreign
                    policy issues, political issues. I remember that I had two men and a woman on my
                    panel. At some point not long after that I actually tried to make myself a list
                    of the questions I was asked while they were still relatively fresh in my mind
                    and I might still have that list in among the mounds of paper that I have filed
                    away. I do seem to remember them asking questions certainly on the Middle East,
                    on the Brezhnev Doctrine, on terrorism. In particular, I recall that since I had
                    been in Canada, in Qu�bec, there had been a couple of little incidents there as
                    part of the Qu�becois independence effort, including even the kidnapping of a
                    businessman or something like that; the examiners wondered whether I considered
                    that to be a very serious problem or not. I allowed as how I didn't think it was
                    a particularly serious omen in Qu�bec. Certainly, there could be a big political
                    transformation in Canada due to public opinion but I wouldn't see it being
                    accomplished by terrorist means. Later on, I found out that one of the
                    examinerwhose name I cannot remembewas not much impressed by that answer, since
                    he himself had apparently been kidnapped once in Central America. Nevertheless,
                    they did pass me on the exam. To me, the oral almost felt a little bit like a
                    fraternity rush or something like thanot that I've ever been through thabut we
                    hit it off, you know. It seemed like they were kind of my kind of people. We got
                    along well together. We seemed to have things in common. So, after about an hour
                    of questions they sent me out to sit there in another room for a few minutes, I
                    guess while they discussed what to do with me. One of them came out and told me
                    I had passed and go to room something or other and get my fingerprints taken so
                    they could start the security clearance. So off I went.</p>
                <p>There was at least one other person there at the time who also passed and was
                    taking the train back to Philadelphia; by coincidence we traveled back together
                    and I later recall running into him maybe once or twice in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long a gap was there before you came in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was about eight months, if I recall correctly, from the time I passed
                    the oral until the time I came in. I came in in October of 1973, so I guess that
                    was fairly quick to go through the security process, considering how many places
                    I had lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days it was, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>EICHER: After you passed the exam, they didn't actually offer you a job, but they
                    put you on a “rank order register” based on your test score and your cone. At
                    the time, they didn't even tell you where you stood on the register or what the
                    chances of getting a job offer were, or how long you might have to wait. It was
                    all rather mysterious, so even after passing the oral exam you couldn't really
                    judge whether you would make it or not. Of course, I was worried about what
                    might come next if I didn't make it and started looking around for other
                    jobs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the meantime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Most of the time I was still in school. I probably took the exam in
                    February or something like that and didn't graduate probably until May from
                    graduate school at Penn. Then I went back to what had been my summer job for the
                    previous few years, working for the tax collector of the city of Westport,
                    Connecticut. That took me into August and just about the time I was getting
                    really worrieI could have stayed at the tax collector's office but it was hardly
                    a living salarat the end of the summer I got the call asking if I could come
                    start a class at the beginning of October, which I happily accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came in in October of 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the constitution of the class, the basic
                        officer class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was, if I recall, 29 people, of which the average age may have been
                    around 30 or so, maybe a little younger than that. It was the 109th class.
                    They've changed the numbering since then, so at some point there will be another
                    109th class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>EICHER: I was 23. The average entering age of entering Foreign Service officers
                    at the time was 30 or 32. I think our class was younger than that. There were a
                    number of us who had come straight out of school into the Foreign Service,
                    although the majority had had real-world experience aside from just university.
                    There were even a few who had come in straight from undergraduate rather than
                    graduate school, but there were also a few who had been in the military in
                    Vietnam or had other experience as teachers or whatever. There were four women
                    in the class. There were two or three “Mustangs,” as they called them, who had
                    come up through the ranks as specialists and were now becoming officers. At that
                    time, the Foreign Service was sharply divided between officers and staff, even
                    with different pay scales, much more so than today. The Mustangs were very
                    impressive to all of us because they were older and had already had lots of
                    overseas and embassy experience. We were having our class in a high-rise
                    building in Roslyn, which is where the Foreign Service Institute was located at
                    the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes. There were cones and, as I said, at the time you had to declare your
                    cone even before you took your Foreign Service exam written test and whether you
                    passed the test depended on your cone. Depending on what cone you chose, you
                    might be able to get in with a lower score or a higher score. Political at the
                    time required the highest score to get in. That's what I chose because it was
                    what I was most interested in and of course, being young and full of
                    self-confidence I thought, why should I try for something less? I do remember at
                    least one guy in our class who came in as an administrative officer grousing
                    frequently that he really wanted to be a political officer and had only taken
                    the administrative test because he thought it would be easier to get in and that
                    he would switch over as soon as possible. So yes, that was an issue.</p>
                <p>I remember, in fact, the first day of class, an interesting little anecdote. You
                    know, I came in bright eyed, going to my first day of work at the State
                    Department, where I was going to be involved in the great events of the world
                    that were going on. And, in fact, great events were underway, because the 1973
                    Arab-Israeli War started just exactly the day before I started my Foreign
                    Service class. You know, here I was, a young man going straight into the center
                    of foreign affairs and world excitement, and what was everyone talking about at
                    class that first morning? Well, the World Series, of course. So that was an
                    interesting jolt to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression, any thoughts about of how you
                        were indoctrinated into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>EICHER: You know, I thought it was great. At the time, it seemed to me to be a
                    class that was extremely relaxed, that was aimed at getting to know the other
                    people in the class, people who were going to be your friends and colleagues for
                    the next twenty or thirty years. There was a lot of emphasis on getting along
                    and enjoying yourself more than on heavy study. There were a lot of lectures on
                    how the State Department worked and a lot of administrative orientation. But,
                    there was very little practical training in the A-100. When I got to my first
                    assignment, I didn't really know how an embassy worked or, for example, how to
                    write a State Department report.</p>
                <p>They did, of course, give us all the language aptitude exam, as I guess they
                    continue to give to everybody. We had some real stars in our class. I think we
                    had several people get 80, which was the highest score possible. I pulled a 61
                    and at the time they told you if you wanted to learn a hard languagArabic or
                    Chinese or somethinyou should have at least 60. So, their advice to me was that
                    well, with 61, if my life's goal was to learn Arabic or Chinese, they would let
                    me do it but they would not recommend it since I would have a harder time than
                    most people in those classes. That was never really my life's goal, so I did not
                    opt for that. I already spoke French and passed that with a 3/3, so they let me
                    through on that. I didn't have to do any further language training and wasn't
                    required to bid on jobs that required language training.</p>
                <p>At the time, the assignment process was also a little bit mysterious. They have
                    changed it so many times with different entering classes and continue to do so.
                    What they did for us was to give us all a list of all of the posts we could
                    choose from and ask us all to give a list of six choices. There were domestic
                    assignments on the list as well overseas posts; there was no requirement at the
                    time to serve overseas for two tours before doing domestic assignments. In any
                    event, I wanted to go abroad, not stay in Washington. So, we all submitted our
                    bid lists and, through some mysterious process, we would probably be assigned
                    one of them or perhaps not, depending on what we chose and what they needed most
                    to fill. There was not the requirement then that you had to do a consular tour,
                    as there is now. There was, however, a preponderance of consular jobs on the
                    list. There were also three jobs in Vietnam on the list to be filled. They all,
                    I think, at least two of them, ended up being filled by fellows who had been
                    there before in the military and who were not too unhappy to go back. I remember
                    giving a lot of thought with my wife to filling out our list. I can't remember
                    quite what was on it but after I had filled it out and submitted it, they came
                    back with a couple of additional choices, one of which was Suva, Fiji, and that
                    was very intriguing to me since I had joined partly with the view of seeing
                    strange and distant places.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>So, you know, I spoke to the assignments people about Fiji and they said, “Oh,
                    you know, this would be great for you, a perfect kind of place, interesting,
                    quiet, and especially good because you're married and you have a small child.
                    It's a good place to get your feet wet and do a lot of different things because
                    it's a small post.” So, we put it down and promptly were assigned there.
                    Interestingly, I spoke to one of my colleagueas far as I know he was the only
                    other one who expressed an interest in Fijand he had also gone and spoken to the
                    same people about it and their advice to him was, “Fiji? You don't want to go to
                    Fiji. That's way out in the middle of no place. Nothing is happening there.” And
                    they assigned him someplace else. Clearly, they had some notions of how to make
                    everybody happy by giving them the assignment of their dreams and guiding you to
                    where they wanted you to go and making you feel like you have gotten, maybe, the
                    best of the deal. Anyway, that was interesting.</p>
                <p>I didn't have to get too much training to go to Fiji. One of the required
                    training courses for everyone was area studies but the closest area studies to
                    Fiji was Southeast Asian area studies, so they assigned me to that, in their
                    wisdom. I went for two weeks and learned about Vietnam, which was all that
                    Southeast Asian studies were about at the time and never heard a word about the
                    Pacific Islands. They also gave me the consular course because I would be
                    assigned as vice consul as well as third secretary to Fiji. That was before the
                    days of “ConGen Roslyn,” so the course was mainly lectures on visa and
                    citizenship laws and procedures. There was little or no effort to give really
                    practical, role-playing kind of training.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, although the position I was going to in Fiji was designated as a
                    consular slot, the charg� wrote me and asked me to take the economic/commercial
                    course because he really wanted to assign me, not to consular work, but to do
                    economic and commercial work. So, here I was a political officer going off to a
                    consular slot to do economic and commercial work. But that was okay. In addition
                    to the consular course, they ran me through an economics course. I think it was
                    a six-week's economic/commercial course. I had not taken much economics in my
                    university, so for me a lot of it was very new with heavy textbooks and charts
                    and math.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Samuelson, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, Samuelson, exactly. Things that I wasn't familiar with. They were
                    trying to make sure everybody had the equivalent of a degree in economics within
                    six weeks and, of course, the commercial side of it as well, how to promote
                    trade and American exports and so forth. They sent us off for a week to work at
                    a Department of Commerce field office someplace in the country that was dealing
                    with foreign trade. I was lucky enough to volunteer for and get San Francisco.
                    So I went off for a week in San Francisco, a rather nice introduction to the
                    Foreign Service and, in fact, it was the first time I've ever been on the West
                    Coast. It was very nice indeed.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>During the A-100 class, I remember they sent us off to a retreat at one point, in
                    West Virginia. They had a little lodge of some kind that they sent us off to for
                    two or three days to play war games and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife respond both to the idea of the Foreign
                        Service and then to Suva and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, Suva was very much a joint decision, so she was happy about that.
                    She also liked the idea of the Foreign Service. She had also grown up moving
                    around overseas. I mentioned that we had met in seventh grade at the American
                    School in Paris and then ended up again at the same high school in Connecticut,
                    which is where we really got together. Her father was with IBM world trade and
                    mine was with Conoco, so both ended up at the company headquarters not far from
                    each other in the New York area and we ended up at the same high school in
                    Westport. She was, I think, very excited to be going out and starting to see the
                    world anwe can get into it more lateshe eventually joined the Foreign Service
                    herself and is now still a Foreign Service specialist in human resources. She's
                    still in the Foreign Service more than ten years after I retired. So, I'm
                    actually a “dependent spouse” and have been for our last couple of overseas
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get to Suva?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We flew by way of a stop in Hawaii, and then flew Honolulu-Suva. We
                    stopped a couple of days in Hawaii to enjoy it there; we had never been before.
                    I always thought one of the great things about the Foreign Service was that you
                    could stop places on your moves around. There are a lot of different places in
                    the world that we have seen for a weekend as we passed through on the way to an
                    assignment someplace else, or on the way back, which was always fun.
                    Particularly in the early days, you know, we couldn't afford to stay anywhere
                    more than a couple of days. The State Department would pay for a one night rest
                    stop and anything else was on you. In fact, Suva was one of the last places the
                    Foreign Service could still theoretically travel to by ship. The Congress had
                    passed the American carrier regulations and one of the last American passenger
                    ships was still doing the South Pacific route from California. It was a cruise
                    ship, of course, which went rarely and the timing was wrong for the trip out.
                    Even coming back we missed it. In retrospect, we regretted that a lot since the
                    timing coming back was just a couple of weeks off. But, being in my first post,
                    I guess, maybe I didn't have the gumption to insist that I could leave a couple
                    of weeks earlier than they wanted me to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Suva from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>EICHER: From 1974 through 1975. We must've gotten there in January of 1974, just
                    four months after I joined the Foreign Service, and stayed until December of
                    1975, so we were there two full years.</p>

                        of course this is a place that quite frankly most people know little about.
                        What was going on when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, first of all, it was at the time the smallest American Embassy in
                    the worlI was the big expansion from three to four Americans at the embassand it
                    covered the biggest consular district in the world, which was mainly fish, but
                    we covered everything from what at the time was the British Solomon Islands
                    Protectorate in the west to Tahiti in French Polynesia in the east. So, it was
                    this huge district to be covered by four people out of Suva. Suva was, in fact,
                    a very small and out-of-the-way place, just as people think of it, and maybe
                    even more so at the time. Suva itself was isolated not only in the South Pacific
                    but also within Fiji. The international airport was in Nadi on the other side of
                    the big island; it was either a flight or a four-plus hour drive away from Suva
                    at the time. The roads were generally unpaved still, so most people would fly in
                    from Nadi to Suva, in a smaller plane which took about half an hour. We landed
                    in Nadi about three in the morning or something like that, all your inconvenient
                    travel times. We perhaps had not been advised as well as we should. The flight
                    to Suva wasn't going to be until seven in the morning or something like that,
                    and we hadn't booked ourselves a hotel in Nadi because no one told us to and we
                    didn't realize it would be paid for as part of our travel costs since we had
                    already stopped in Honolulu. We didn't realize that Nadi wasn't a real airport,
                    in the American sense; in those days it was just a tiny building without even a
                    real waiting room for people getting off flights. There were no chairs, no air
                    conditioning. So, the three of umy wife and son and just sort of wandered across
                    the street and sat on a grassy knoll in a field and watched our first Fijian
                    sunrise. It was very pretty and we were happy enough, on our first Foreign
                    Service adventure, but all the workers at the airport thought we were crazy, I
                    guess; Westerners go to hotels, they don't sit in a field waiting hours for a
                    plane. Eventually, we did get on the plane to Suva and were we were met at the
                    airport by the charg�, Vance Hall, and his wife, Julia, and taken to the Grand
                    Pacific Hotel, which was a nice, old, colonial structure right on the water in
                    Suva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Big veranda and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Big veranda, high ceilings, you know, very colonial style. We only stayed
                    there a few days before they moved us to more modest accommodations, not that
                    the Grand Pacific was any great shakes. But, it was going to be a long hotel
                    stay. Since we were a new addition to the embassy, there was no housing
                    available for us and we had to start a search, which took quite some time.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In terms of the politics of it, Fiji was a former British colony, now independent
                    and in its own way kind of a superpower among the many tiny South Pacific
                    countries and islands. It was really much bigger and more significant than any
                    of its major neighbors, most of which were, in fact, even still colonies at the
                    time, so Fiji was significant in that sense. The U.S. ambassador was resident in
                    New Zealand and he had four hats, as ambassador to Fiji, Tonga and Western
                    Samoa, as well as New Zealand. Tonga was under the Fiji embassy, as were most of
                    the Pacific Islands, but Western Samoa for some reason was under the embassy in
                    New Zealand, I guess because of the flight connections or something. The
                    Ambassador was a political appointee, Armistead Selden, a former congressman
                    from Alabama, who would come up once every six months and kiss babies and slap
                    people on the back and make a good impression and then disappear again. So, from
                    that point of view it was a perfect arrangement where you didn't really have an
                    ambassador to worry about.</p>
                <p>The American Embassy when I got there was also an interesting place. It also had
                    a very colonial kind of feeling. It was upstairs on the main shopping street of
                    Suva, Cumming Street, which was a very small street full of duty-free shops.
                    Fiji was a duty-free port and tourists from Australia would come in and would
                    buy their cameras and stereo equipment, and so the street was just full of these
                    little Indian run duty-free stores. And, above one of them in an old building,
                    up a narrow staircase between two other entrances, was the American Embassy,
                    which was just two rooms, one little private office for the charg� and then one
                    quite large room where the other three Americans sat at one end and the four
                    local employees, as we called them at the time, sat at the other end. A ceiling
                    fan turned above us and it was quite easy to imagine that we were working there
                    a century earlier than we were. There was a small walk-in vault which was sort
                    of around the corner where the nationals couldn't see into it, not that there
                    was anything to see. There were no communications. In order to send telegrams,
                    we had to go down to the local cable and wireless office and send them off as
                    commercial cables. If we wanted to send classified telegrams, we had a little
                    machine which allowed us to encrypt them and still, we would have to carry the
                    encrypted telegrawhich was in five letter nonsense words by the time it was
                    encryptedown to the local cable and wireless office, where the clerks would
                    raise their eyebrows if they were new employees. The old ones got used to it and
                    would take the telegram and transmit it to Washington or wherever we were
                    sending it to. This was a very interesting introduction to the Foreign Service,
                    not quite what I had expected. It was so complicated to send and receive
                    classified cables that we didn't do it often. Most of our reporting was still by
                    letter or “airgram,” which was the old State Department reporting format where
                    you wrote hard copies of reports on special letterhead, numbered and recorded
                    them, and then transmitted them by diplomatic pouch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the government. What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was a parliamentary democracy. There was a governor general who was
                    appointed by the Queen but who was, in fact, a Fijian, a chief from one of the
                    prominent families. There was a prime minister who was also a Fijian, Ratu Sir
                    Kamasese Mara. These were chiefly Fijians who were from the best families and
                    part of the ethnic Fijian nobility. But, there was an underlying tension because
                    the country's population at the time was more than half ethnic Indian. These
                    were Indians who had been brought in during the previous century as indentured
                    laborers for the sugar plantations and who had stayed and prospered, sugar being
                    the biggest export from Fiji. People got along pretty well with each other, but
                    it was an extremely ethnically conscious society, not in a nasty way, but just
                    the way people identified each other sort of struck us. If somebody was walking
                    down the road, he wasn't a boy, he was a Fijian boy or an Indian boy, or a
                    Chinese boy. At the time, I think about 51 or 52% of the population was Indian,
                    about 40 or 45% was ethnic Fijian and then there were also Chinese and European
                    communities. The Fijians were still in control of the political power at the
                    time. The Indians did have politicians but most of them were in opposition. Fiji
                    had a little parliament, which I attended a couple of times and found to be kind
                    of eye opening and amusing in that it was almost sort of a caricature of the
                    British Parliament, with constant catcalls and jibes across the divided floor of
                    the very small parliament chamber. There was an army, which was really at the
                    time regarded more as kind of a toy soldier army. They would parade on
                    ceremonial occasions; they would wear bright red shirts and white sulus, which
                    are the skirts that the Fijian men wore. The main activity the army seemed to
                    have was going down and welcoming cruise ships in their colorful uniforms with a
                    brass band.</p>
                <p>The overall feeling, on the political side, was that it was a new government, a
                    very moderate government that was just starting to feel its way in the world. It
                    had just gotten its independence three or four years before, in 1970, I think.
                    There was still a colonial feel about the place. A lot of the senior civil
                    servants were still British, including the Secretary to Government, I think the
                    title was, who was someone we dealt with a lot. The government was very
                    pro-Western, not in the sense that it was a cheerleader for Western policies or
                    causes, but that nobody even seemed to consider a different approach. Even
                    though this was still the height of the Cold War there was no thought at all
                    that Fiji would take the other side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They hadn't moved yet into the sort of peace keeping work,
                        as they are now?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, they are now. In fact, I think in retrospect, although I could only
                    follow it from a distance, this probably contributed to a lot of the later coups
                    and changes within Fiji. The army did go off first to Lebanon as peacekeepers,
                    where they were in UNIFIL and they discovered that, you know, armies are
                    powerful, armies are real, armies are in charge of governments, especially here
                    in the Middle East. And so, they went back home and took over their government.
                    This was really extremely sad. And there still are a lot of Fijian troops in the
                    Middle East with the UN and I think they've been some other places as well. But
                    that came later. At the time the army was not political. And it was very sad for
                    us to see it change later, because during our time it was so peaceful and
                    democratic.</p>
                <p>But, even when we were there, you could see that the Indians were unhappy. I'm
                    not pretending that it was a perfect situation. There were some discriminatory
                    laws, for example. A lot of the land in Fiji was in tribal trust and could not
                    be sold and this therefore made it very difficult for the Indians to become
                    landowners. And, the Indians in general, as a community, tended to be looking to
                    leave Fiji. The ethnic Fijians were certainly not looking to leave in any
                    significant numbers. And so you had Indians in general trying to get to
                    Australia, New Zealand or to the United States and a lot of them succeeded in
                    doing that, to the extent that now I believe that the Fijians are solidly in the
                    majority and the population might be down to about 40% Indian. But the ethnic
                    troubles remain. Even when we were there, the ethnic situation was not really
                    troublesompeople got alonbut it was the big underlying political issue in Fiji
                    even then. It was clear that there was a potential for real political tension.
                    Fiji was not a melting pot; the two communities were very separate. It was, of
                    course, the racial divide that eventually led to the military coups, after the
                    Indians finally won an election and formed a government. The army was
                    overwhelmingly ethnic Fijian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much intermarriage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Some, but not a lot. You know, it wasn't a rare thing but neither was it
                    a terribly common thing. It wasn't frowned on, but it just didn't happen very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somehow the mix sounds like it wasn't as deep there as it
                        was in some places.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>EICHER: I think it probably wasn't. Most Fijians still lived in villages and even
                    the ones in towns still had very close ties to their villages, which might be on
                    other islands of the Fiji group. It was very much the Third World, not the
                    grinding, extreme poverty you see in Africa or South Asia, but still very
                    underdeveloped conditions, with many places not having electricity, no paved
                    roads outside the main towns, and many of the houses still built of sticks and
                    thatched roofs. Those kinds of traditional Fijian houses were called bures and
                    could be very picturesque, but they could also look very run down and unpleasant
                    to live in. Conditions for the Indians were generally better, although a lot of
                    them were still manual laborers in the sugar fields, which is extremely tough
                    work.</p>
                <p>The Indians as well as the Fijians tended to be rather communal. There would
                    still be a lot of Indian festivals that would go on which were interesting.
                    Moving to Fiji was initially liberating for many of the Indians. There were many
                    middle-to-lower caste Indians who found that in Fiji the caste system didn't
                    apply. A lot of the new arrivals just changed their names, their family names,
                    and suddenly it looked like they came from much more significant families or
                    higher castes. In fact, our best friends and next-door neighbors were the
                    Maharajs, which of course, is about as high as you can get in India, but they
                    acknowledged that their family probably had not been Maharajs when they left
                    India for Fiji.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the staff at the embassy, was it mostly Indian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, it was mostly Fijian, as matter of fact. I don't think there were any
                    Indians. I'm not sure why, since the Indians tended to be better educated. I
                    guess it probably developed the way it does at so many embassies, that when
                    someone gets a position their friends and relatives seem to get in after them.
                    There was at least one who was mixed race, Fijian and Chinese, I think. But
                    remember, we're only talking bout four people; it was a very small staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because from what little I know about
                        Polynesia, there's a tendency by sort of the Indians and the Chinese to take
                        over many commercial or office type jobs and the native population is almost
                        brushed aside.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That was very much the case in Fiji, certainly. The commercial side and
                    even the white collar side in general was overwhelmingly Indian. There was also
                    a handful of Chinese small businessmen. Maybe it was a deliberate decision by
                    the embassy to hire some Fijian's. Maybe it just happened that way. I don't know
                    what the history of it was but we did end up with Fijians.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The Embassy made a move while I was there. We moved out of our little
                    colonial-style office on Cumming Street down to a new high-rise along the
                    waterfront; I guess it must have been six or seven stories tall and this was
                    very much a skyscraper by Fijian standards, there were only a few buildings that
                    big in Suva. The New Zealand Embassor High Commission, I guess it wahad the top
                    two floors of the building and the U.S. Embassy had half the floor below that,
                    which I guess shows the extent of how the U.S. official presence in Fiji
                    compared even to a country the size of New Zealand. It was a modern office
                    building, just constructed. I got my own office for the first time, which was a
                    very nice office with a big picture window looking out on this gorgeous view
                    over the bay. I could see all Suva from up there; it was great. I understand the
                    Embassy has moved at least a couple of times since then and they are in new
                    quarters now. Certainly the building we were in was far, far below the security
                    standards we insist on for embassies these days. In fact, there was no security
                    at all. No Marines, of course, and not even a local guard or a code on the door.
                    Anyone could just walk in. There was a small, walk-in vault in the back that did
                    have a door with a code, but aside from that, there were no barriers or locks at
                    all between the entrance of the Embassy and all the offices inside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a New Zealand or Australia or British presence
                        in Fiji at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There was a very small diplomatic community. I mentioned that the New
                    Zealand High Commission was right upstairs from us. The Australians were by far
                    the largest diplomatic presence there, followed by the New Zealanders. The
                    British were very influential and had a High Commission, as well as still having
                    a lot of Brits in senior government positions. The Chinese were there and the
                    Indians, of course, were there. The Indian High Commissioner was the dean of the
                    diplomatic corps and had been there for many years; his wife used to give
                    afternoon teas regularly for the diplomatic ladies, which my wife enjoyed. The
                    French set up a one-person office while we were there. That was the extent of
                    the diplomatic community. There were several very young Australian and New
                    Zealand diplomats on their first postings, just about our age, who we got to be
                    very good friends with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was the Taiwanese, now that you ask. At the time, the U.S. hadn't
                    recognized Red China yet, and neither had the Fijians. So they were friendly
                    Chinese, who we would sometimes see socially, although we didn't have much to do
                    with them from a professional perspective. Most of the diplomatic offices in
                    Suva were really high commissions rather than embassies because they represented
                    Commonwealth countries. There were also a few other diplomatic representatives
                    who were accredited to Fiji but resident elsewhere. You know, you might get a
                    visitor from time to time, say a German ambassador resident in Australia, but
                    not very often.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The economy depended even back then to a large extent on tourism. Tourists were
                    overwhelmingly Australians which, again, was nice from our perspective because
                    instead of having the “ugly American” image, the ones who got in trouble were
                    usually the Australians and so the “ugly Australian” image prevailed. Americans
                    tended to be very well-liked, still. We didn't see very many Americans. Fiji is
                    quite remote and at the time it was quite expensive for American tourists to get
                    to, so Americans looking for tropical islands would usually end up going to
                    either the Caribbean or Tahiti or somewhere closer. Not many Americans came to
                    Fiji, and those who did were usually well off and went to the big tourist hotels
                    along the south coast, so we didn't see many of them in Suva. I remember only
                    once being marginally involved in looking for a missing Americawho eventually
                    turned up in another countrand I don't think we ever had an American in jail or
                    otherwise in trouble during my two year tour. There were a very few prominent
                    Americans who visited from time to timfor example, Raymond Burr owned a small
                    island therbut we wouldn't normally see them. Raymond Burr raised orchids on his
                    islanorchids grew all over Fiji, along with all kinds of other beautiful
                    flowerand once he sent a big bunch of orchids to the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to the outlying islands and your
                        impressions of that, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It's interesting because, you know, I thought I was extremely busy at the
                    time. It was my first real job out of university and I would go to the office at
                    whatever time in the morning and leave at whatever the designated time was in
                    the afternoon. I don't think overtime was ever an issue in Fiji. It seemed to me
                    I was very busy. For the first 18 months I was doing mainly economic/commercial
                    work. My first big taswhich still sticks in my mind because it was my first big
                    task in the Foreign Servicwas putting together the annual “economic trends
                    report,” which was a report that the embassy was supposed to do once a year but
                    which had not been done on Fiji for a very long time, if ever. I remember
                    spending quite some time digging through different government papers and reports
                    and dealing with other embassies and some businessmen to put together this
                    report, and then presenting the draft to the charg�, having no idea what his
                    reaction would be, and being quite pleased that he liked it very much and sent
                    it off to Washington with practically no changes. It was published, as these
                    reports were to be distributed to the business community, so my very first
                    publication was a ten or twenty page report on economic trends in Fiji.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>The other commercial work was trade promotion. There were a couple of programs we
                    carried out in coordination with the Department of Commerce. One was called a
                    WTDa world trader data reporwhich supplied information about local companies to
                    American companies who wanted to know about them before entering into a business
                    or trading agreement. I would have to check with local banks and others to get
                    information about the companies to send in, their creditworthiness and their
                    reputation, and such. There was another kind of standard report that I can't
                    remember the acronym for, which was aimed at getting American exporters together
                    with local companies. When we got an inquiry from a local firm that was
                    interested in importing any kind of American product, I'd get the details and
                    send them off to Washington, which had a huge register of firms interested in
                    exporting just about everything; the American firm would then send information
                    and offers directly to the Fijian firm. For example, a lot of the local Indian
                    shops wanted sporting equipment, American sporting equipment, and so I would
                    talk with them about what they wanted, and would look up some complicated code
                    numbers, put it all into a telegram, send it back and it would go to the
                    distributors who would send out their offers. The same thing for joint ventures.
                    I remember trying to help out some company that was trying to start a joint
                    venture to produce mattresses but never succeeded; American mattresses were too
                    expensive. But I do remember some of the sporting goods sales. Things seemed to
                    go well and the little Indian shops that sold tennis rackets and scuba equipment
                    and so forth seemed to be very pleased and excited with the number of inquiries
                    and offers they got from American companies to sell their things there. In
                    general, Fiji was a very small market and I'm not sure the sales amounted to
                    much in real terms. We weren't involved in any big sales like airplanes. And the
                    big American investorsay in hoteldidn't seem to want or need the Embassy's
                    help.</p>
                <p>It was very rare for an American salesman actually to come to Fiji during my time
                    there. I remember one came trying to sell turkey tails. This seemed kind of
                    strange to me, but he talked a lot about how they were almost all meat and very
                    good. I never saw him again so I don't think he had much luck.</p>
                <p>Since it was such a small embassy I also got involved in some other kinds of
                    activities and reporting and did some consular work, mainly signing
                    non-immigrant visas which were pretty much processed by our local employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes in a place like Suva you end up with a lot of
                        Iranians or other people who come in visa shopping. Did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>EICHER: Practically not at all since we were so out-of-the-way and hard to get
                    to. We had a fair sized non-immigrant visa business from Tahiti, since we were
                    responsible for French Polynesia, and this would be handled through a system of
                    travel agents. There were two or three of them, but one in particular, who would
                    fly to Fiji every couple of months with a suitcase full of French passports of
                    Tahitian residents who wanted to take their vacation in Los Angeles. He would
                    park himself in a hotel for a couple of days while we worked our way through
                    these couple of hundred passports that he'd brought with him. Then, once we
                    issued the visas, he would take the passports and go back to Tahiti again. It
                    was rare to turn down a visa applicant from Tahiti. Unfortunately, we were not
                    actually allowed to visit Tahiti in an official capacity. The French considered
                    that, of course, Tahiti was an integral part of France, so it should be handled
                    by the embassy in Paris rather than the American Embassy in Suva. So, we could
                    never make official visits to Tahiti but my wife and I, and the kids, did make a
                    point of stopping there for a couple of days on the way back to the United
                    States at the end of our tour. We were taken around and treated very nicely by
                    one of these travel agents for whom we had been doing visas for the past couple
                    of years. They kept saying, “Oh, you've got to stay longer and I can fly you to
                    Bora Bora and put you up out there,” but of course, being first tour people we
                    didn't know how to work any of this in advance and, in any event, it probably
                    would not have been appropriate to accept that kind of gift. I don't know if it
                    would have been legal at the time or not but it certainly would not have been
                    appropriate to accept it.</p>
                <p>So I did do the consular work for the last six months I was there. When the
                    consular officer left, after I had been in Suva for 18 months, I was shifted to
                    consular duties and the outgoing consular officer's replacement, who was a bit
                    more senior than me, took over the economic/commercial duties.</p>
                <p>Before I get to consular, I should also mention I also do remember following a
                    political convention, the so-called political convention of Fiji's ruling party,
                    the name of which I forget. But I remember going down to attend the convention
                    and even to my 24-year-old inexperienced eyes it really was quite an amateurish
                    and unimpressive kind of gathering. I guess my report must have been a bit
                    snide, because I remember the charg� teasing me about it. I also did some low
                    level political reporting on other issues, some of it on the basis of newspaper
                    reports from other island groups we covered. For example, we'd get the French
                    language newspapers from Tahiti and sometime they'd have news that was worth
                    summarizing and sending on, for example, about nuclear testing. That allowed me
                    to keep up my French, even though we were at an English language post. And I did
                    reporting about developments in Tonga, whenever I visited there.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Most of our reports would be sent to Washington by “airgram,” which was the
                    standard reporting format at the time. We used cables relatively sparingly, not
                    that we had a whole lot to report. I remember the charg� being delighted when we
                    hit 100 cables in a year. We did get a telex machine installed when we moved to
                    the new embassy office, so we no longer had to take cables down to the cable and
                    wireless office for transmission. The telex was linked directly to the U.S.
                    embassy in New Zealand and all our cable communications went through there. We
                    also got a very small classified pouch every two weeks. The diplomatic courier
                    would come all the way to Suva and we would take turns meeting him or her at the
                    hotel on a weekend to pick up the pouch and then go lock it in the vault.</p>
                <p>There were also endless other little jobs that you might not get at a big
                    embassy. For example, I remember going with the charg� to the Suva garbage dump
                    to burn classified papers. Literally, we just put them in a pile and set a match
                    to them and then stood and watched until we were sure they were consumed. There
                    was no shredder at the embassy; I'm not sure shredders even existed yet. There
                    was a small incinerator that was shipped in at some point to use for burning
                    classified, but for some reason it couldn't be hooked up. So, we went to the
                    dump to burn classified. I'm sure that was an experience none of my entering
                    classmates had.</p>
                <p>As to consular work, when I switched from economic/commercial to consular, I
                    started doing a lot more of the passports coming in from Tahiti and did some
                    immigrant visas as well. There were a fair number of Indians who were eligible
                    to immigrate to the U.S., through family connections, so those took some work.
                    When I started doing consular work almost full time it had been about a year and
                    a half since I had taken the consular course and I had never really done most of
                    the tasks before. None of the other officers at the embassy at that point had
                    ever really done much consular work either, so they couldn't offer much advice.
                    I remember spending hours sweating over the consular manuals and the FAMs
                    (Foreign Affairs Manuals) whenever anything strange would come up and, you know,
                    making my best judgment and then six weeks later getting something back from
                    Washington saying, “Well, next time you ought to do it this way.” I didn't like
                    the consular work very much. I hated denying visas to people, which we had to do
                    frequently, in particular with Indians who wanted non-immigrant visas. I
                    remember a couple of instances where people had come in who had criminal
                    records, which they had lied about on their applications. I struggled at great
                    length over whether these were “crimes involving moral turpitude,” which is what
                    the U.S. statute said would be prohibited. But what exactly constitutes moral
                    turpitude was never clearly defined in any of our consular manuals. In at least
                    one immigrant visa case in which a whole family was applying for visas, a man
                    had clearly neglected to inform his wife that he had a criminal record, which
                    was also a rather awkward situation. I did consular work as my main job for
                    about six months and although I didn't much care for it, it was certainly not
                    onerous. Fiji was not a visa mill by any means. I am quite certain I must've had
                    time to do other kinds of work at the same time I was doing the consular
                    work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Tonga? Tonga only came on, you might say, the
                        world radar when Queen Elizabeth was crowned. I mean, the Queen of Tonga
                        came, a huge woman and very personable. During your time what was happening
                        in Tonga?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Tonga was an amazing place. I visited every six months or so. When you
                    flew in on one of the little inter-island planes you could see the whole main
                    island from the plane as you came in. It was that small, although even Tonga was
                    fairly large by South Pacific standards. It was still an absolute monarchy. King
                    Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was the king. He was a huge Tongan, one of the biggest
                    people I had ever met. He stood six foot three or four or more and must have
                    weighed well over 300 pounds. Tongans, and Polynesians in general, are enormous
                    people. There is kind of a general misimpression that the lithe Tahitian beauty
                    is what the Polynesians look like. In fact, I think that's really more of the
                    East Asian, Chinese, immigrant blood that makes for those slim builds. If you
                    look more at the Gauguin paintings and so forth, at how the Tahitians looked 100
                    ago, they were very big people. The Samoans were also very big. Fiji is right on
                    the border of Melanesia and Polynesia; the Melanesians are darker and aren't so
                    big. So Fiji had both big and small people, although most were on the large
                    side; the prime minister and the governor general were very large; Fijians
                    tended to be big people but not all were.</p>
                <p>In fact, I had heard an interesting theory that the Polynesians were big because
                    of “survival of the fattest.” As they were taking their canoe trips across the
                    Pacific discovering new lands, the thin ones would die off and the “thin genes”
                    would die off with them. The fat ones would survive and prosper, so you ended up
                    with very heavy people. I have no idea whether it's true or not but the story
                    has stuck with me.</p>
                <p>So, you did have the enormous king in Tonga. He was apparently a sight to behold
                    in his younger days as he would ride in on a surfboard. There is an extremely
                    funny picture of his visit to Japan with his wife, who was also quite big, and
                    the two are standing there together with tiny Emperor Hirohito and his wife and
                    it's a very Mutt and Jeff kind of look. They said the king couldn't fit into an
                    airplane seat, so they had to make special arrangements when he flew.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I did get a chance to meet the king. I accompanied the ambassador to Tonga,
                    Ambassador Selden, on one trip and we had an audience with the king which was
                    extremely interesting. We went to the royal palace, which was basically an old
                    wooden Victorian house, the kind you might find in any American city. There was
                    not a lot of ceremony but there were a few guards and butlers and so forth, who
                    ushered you in to see the king. They told you beforehand that you would be
                    served champagne and the king would be served orange squash, a kind of sweet
                    orange drink, and when the king finished his orange drink, it was time for you
                    to leave. So we sat down, Ambassador Selden and his wife and I, and chatted with
                    the king. We were told the meeting would be about half an hour and after about
                    forty-five minutes, the orange juice was still there and we were looking at our
                    watches and the ambassador said something about, “Well, I guess we should be
                    going” but the king just kept on talking and asking questions. After an hour the
                    juice was still there and at this point, we were late for whatever else was on
                    the schedule, which certainly couldn't have been as important as the king, but
                    the ambassador was rather nervous and so we finally took our leave. I don't
                    think he had finished his orange drink yet. I hope we didn't cause a diplomatic
                    incident with that. I can't even remember what we talked about although I am
                    sure I wrote a report. At some point I should do some Freedom of Information Act
                    requests and get some of these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any interest, I know at one point in some
                        places we had the basic policy of strategic denial, which was to keep the
                        Soviets from setting up in ports which might be used for military purposes,
                        or even ship visits, but was there anything like that going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Very, very little. There was no sign of Soviets in the South Pacific at
                    that point that I can recall at all. We did have the occasional U.S. ship visit,
                    which was rare but I certainly remember at least one for which the embassy gave
                    a large cocktail party. It may have been the Fourth of July eveand probably at
                    the Grand Pacific Hotel, although I don't swear to thawhere one of the officers
                    all dressed in his white uniform cut a cake with his saber, much to the delight
                    of the many guests. In fact, I remember one of my early diplomatic faux pas
                    surrounded that reception. With an embassy the size of Suva, everybody was
                    enlisted to write the invitations. For whatever reason, we didn't have them
                    printed out. We just used the standard invitations that had blanks on them and
                    we had to fill in the date and time and “in honor of” and so forth on the top of
                    the invitations. So, everybody had a lot of those to do and I, apparently,
                    filled out one to His Worship the Mayor of Suva and put the wrong date on it and
                    His Worship showed up at the hotel a day or two early for the reception. You
                    know, everybody just laughed it off, the mayor arriving for a party two days
                    early. The mayor of Suva, “His Worship,” as mayors are called in British cities,
                    was not really a big thing, since Suva was a city of only about 60 or 70,000
                    people. We're really talking about a small town. So it was not really a big deal
                    but, of course, I was mortified and one of my colleagues at the embassy had
                    great fun reminding me often about the incident.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So we did have a ship visit. One of the issues that was going on at the time was
                    the law of the sea negotiations. And, in this, in fact, Fiji was of some
                    significance. I wouldn't want to overplay it, but there were a whole range of
                    issues including free passage and territorial waters and archipelagos and
                    delineating maritime boundaries and others. We did get involved in some of that,
                    in passing U.S. positions back and forth to the Fijians on these different
                    aspects the law of the sea. I learned quite a bit about the law of the sea.</p>
                <p>Another big political issue out there at the time was the French nuclear tests,
                    which were going on in French Polynesia. The rest of the South Pacific was just
                    really up in arms about that. Of course, it was far away from Fiji and the
                    French did what they wanted, and there was not much the island countries could
                    do about it, but it gave the French a very bad name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that at the time when some French special forces blew
                        up the Rainbow Warrior?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That came much later, long after I had left. You know, there really had
                    not been those vigorous environmental protesters back at the time in the same
                    way as now. We are talking in 1974-75. But the nuclear tests were quite an
                    issue. And, I guess, the other general issue that was going on was the process
                    of decolonization, which was starting to make its way across the South Pacific.
                    You already had Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa as independent and in the years
                    that followed, almost all of the islands were to become independent. They had
                    put together a political body, the South Pacific Forum, which met every year.
                    There were actually two different organizations that met. It gets complicated.
                    There was the South Pacific Commission, which included the outside powers such
                    as the United States and the British and the Australians and so forth plus all
                    of the island countries, both independent and still under colonial rule.
                    Separately, there was an organization of the independent islands, called the
                    South Pacific Forum, which was making a few radical, anti-colonial kinds of
                    statementor what appeared to us as sucbut which were, in fact, quite mild and
                    not at all threatening to the relationship with the West. So, I did attend a
                    couple of South Pacific Commission meetings, which got me to Noumea, New
                    Caledonia, another French territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to the Solomon Islands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Only to pass through. At the time it was still the British Solomon
                    Islands Protectorate. I stopped in Honiara, the capital, once to change planes,
                    en route to a big South Pacific Commission meeting in Nauru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that just a mountain of lava or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>EICHER: Pretty much. It's an island of mineral phosphator at least it waand the
                    whole island is just eleven or twelve miles around. At the time, it was quite a
                    rich island because of its phosphate but it was sort of digging itself out of
                    existence. They built a new hotel complex and conference center just
                    specifically to host the South Pacific Commission. I was made a member of the
                    three or four person U.S. delegation, along with the desk officer from
                    Washington and a delegation leader who was a minor politician from Hawaii. It
                    was two weeks in Nauru, which is quite a long time to spend in Nauru. But, it
                    was interesting, I recall, although I can no longer remember what the issues we
                    were discussing at the South Pacific Commission. Nauru, however, definitely
                    sticks in my mind as being small, one small road going around the outside of the
                    island, one small airstrip down the middle, one hotel which they built
                    specifically for the conference, one nice conference center. I was pleased with
                    the experience, which was my first multilateral conference; perhaps that helped
                    increase my interest in a UN job many years later. I ended up with my photograph
                    in National Geographic, only you can't tell it's me. They had somebody there
                    covering Nauru at the time of the conference. He took a photograph of the
                    plenary of the conference, I'm just a pinprick on the photograph, even though
                    there weren't all that many people at the conference, perhaps a hundred at the
                    most. The hotel wasn't big enough for everybody, so we ended up sharing rooms
                    with other members of our delegation. Every delegation was assigned a chauffeur
                    from among the local population, which was quite wealthy by South Pacific
                    standards and many of them had their own automobiles. The guy who took us around
                    had a Lincoln Continental and I asked him “what do you do when it breaks down?”
                    There wasn't any sign of any car repair shops there. He said, “Oh, I send it
                    back to Australia to be serviced.” So they had money coming in. They still had
                    pigs running around loose and so forth, like on the other South Pacific islands,
                    but the houses were made of stone instead of twigs and generally had tin roofs
                    and were slightly more prosperous looking. Supposedly, the government was
                    putting the phosphate money into good investments in Australia so that they
                    would be able to live after the phosphate ran out. At one point, the largest
                    building in Melbourne, I think, was an office skyscraper called Nauru House. In
                    general, however, I understand that the investments did not work out and now the
                    phosphate is gone. Some of the investments went south and I don't know what that
                    has done to the poor people of Nauru.</p>
                <p>I remember the president of Nauru was a fellow named Hammer de Robert, who I met
                    at a reception they gave for the delegates. It was a heady experience for me
                    because he was the first president I had ever met, although he was the president
                    of an island thirteen miles in circumference with a population of probably 5,000
                    or something. I met him under curious circumstances. I had never had sushi
                    before and raw fish was not something that appealed to me as a concept. I was
                    standing there with two or three other delegates chatting, as you do at these
                    diplomatic receptions, and up walks the president himself with a tray of sushi
                    in his hands saying, “I have just had this flown in from Japan. Wouldn't you
                    like some?” So, I had my first sushi, which to my surprise was actually quite
                    good, as much as I hated to admit it. Ah, the things I've done for my country.
                    Anyway, I met my first president and it was all a very interesting
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Back to your original question, I passed through the Solomon Islands on my
                    circuitous route to Nauru. There are not a lot of flights in and out of Nauru
                    and my route took me from Fiji to Vila in the New Hebridewhich is now Vanuatthen
                    to Honiara and then to Port Moresby and thence to Nauru. It was an endless trip.
                    In Honiara, we went down to the yacht club; I say “we” because on the flight
                    from Vila to Honiara I linked up with a couple of Australians who were going to
                    the conference. I had really wanted to go explore the city of Honiara and they
                    got a big laugh out of that saying, “Ha, ha. There's nothing to explore here in
                    Honiara.” So, we went and sat at the yacht club and had a beer as we waited a
                    few hours for a return to the airport to take the next plane. We did drive
                    through Honiara and I have to admit there didn't seem to be much to see. In Port
                    Moresby, I don't think we even left the airport.</p>
                <p>I also did a little unusual traveling out of Nauru, which had its own airlina
                    reflection of its mineral wealtwhich I think consisted of one plane, which was a
                    real jet which must've held fifty or sixty people. As a little perk, the
                    Nauruans had arranged to bring in a little band from another island to entertain
                    the conference-goers and they invited anybody who wanted to fly along on the
                    trip to pick them up. So, a bunch of us hopped on the plane and flew from Nauru
                    to Ponapei to Truk and back to Nauru again and picked up the band which then
                    entertained us at the nightly functions that they had for the conference-goers.
                    It was quite an amazing show of hospitality that they put on for the foreigners
                    in Nauru. I'm sure they had never had such a big group of officials from
                    different countries there at one time before. I remember being at a dinner where
                    they were pouring the wine for all the guests and one of the wines they poured
                    was Blue Nun. One of the ladies at my table, when the waiter asked her “white or
                    red” said that she would have the Blue Nun and the waiter said, “Oh, sorry
                    ma'am. We only have white or red.” It was a funny land of contrasts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue of Japanese and Soviet over-fishing an issue
                        in that area at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I don't recall it being an issue of particular controversy, although it
                    certainly would have come up in the context of the law of the sea negotiations.
                    In fact, I have no doubt that, as they were claiming their two hundred mile
                    territorial limit that was one of the issues they had in mind. In fact, the
                    whole idea of a two hundred mile territorial limit, if you take some of these
                    island groups and you draw what two hundred mile limits would be around them,
                    it's really quite a significant swath of area. You can see why it was quite such
                    an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't know how it was at the time but back in the
                        mid-1990s I visited Ponapei for a week to talk about setting up consular
                        operations there. Looking at this, you could see a sort of disaster looming
                        there in that we were putting in a lot of subsidized money because it was
                        part of our Department of Interior's responsibility, and essentially
                        destroyed the fishing industry and there wasn't much else for people to do,
                        other than a lot of beer drinking, and it looked like a town in the poor
                        part of West Virginia or something. Were you seeing examples of that where
                        you were, of modernity, sort of displacing the traditional work of people
                        whether it be fishing or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I don't remember it quite that blatantly there but it was certainly a
                    problem throughout the South Pacific. In Tonga for example, there was only one
                    factory in the entire country; it produced desiccated coconut and employed very
                    few people. That was it. Aside from that, people survived largely either on
                    subsistence or on remittances from Tongans who were going to work in Australia
                    and New Zealand and a little bit of tourist income. This, of course, strikes you
                    as, you know, how did they survive before there were remittances from Australia
                    and New Zealand? And so, whatever they were doing back then, they were
                    apparently not doing to the same extent anymore. You know, there really are many
                    desperately poor islands out there. You don't get the same feeling about poverty
                    as you do in Africa, or in the Middle East or in South Asia, where I have
                    subsequently seen such stark poverty. Maybe it didn't seem as grim because the
                    weather is good, the fruit grows on trees, the fish are plenty and there are not
                    so many people. You don't get the sense of desperate poverty, extreme poverty,
                    that you get in the other places. And the people aryou know, I hate characterize
                    national groups but as you spend enough time in the Foreign Service you can't
                    avoid it sometimebut they do seem to be generally happy. The Fijians, in
                    particular, were just always smiling and singing and pleasant. So yes, they were
                    poor. Yes, many of them had practically nothing. Yes, a lot of them lived in
                    stick houses with thatched roofs. But you didn't get the sense of “my goodness,
                    such destitute people” that you do definitely get in a lot of other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find social life for you and your wife
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was quiet, not a lot to it. Suva, I think I mentioned, was just a
                    small city town, 60, 70, 80,000 people tops. The paved roads ended at the end of
                    town and if you wanted to leave Suva, you had to drive on dirt roads. There were
                    no beaches in the Suva area and to get to the nice beaches in the south part of
                    the island was a drive of a couple of hours over kind of nasty dirt roads. We
                    would do that sometimes but not so often. When you did get there it was just
                    exactly the idea you would conjure up of the South Pacific, with the beautiful
                    white beach stretching off as far as you can see in the distance and the palm
                    trees waving in the breeze and nobody else on the beach either direction as far
                    as you could see. But back in Suva, it wasn't unpleasant but in a lot of ways it
                    was your typical isolated Third World town without much going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>There was a little group of young diplomats, mainly Australians, New Zealanders
                    and Brits, who were about our age and just starting off on their first Foreign
                    Service tours, who we got along quite well with. We met lots of the other
                    Europeans. We got to know our neighbors who were Indians and some of the
                    Fijians. It was generally a friendly kind of area, a nice place to be with a
                    young family. My second son was born there at a tiny little Fijian hospital; a
                    maternity hospital with six beds all in one room, no windows but just shutters
                    that were held open with a stick. My wife was the first official American ever
                    to have a baby in Fiji rather than being medevaced to New Zealand, which didn't
                    have any appeal for her at all. It was interesting and exotic and, in
                    retrospect, brave. We got to know a bunch of people who were having babies at
                    the same time she was so that added to our circle of friends.</p>
                <p>So, we had several groups of friends who we did things with; I don't remember
                    feeling bored. But generally, it was quiet. I don't even remember there being a
                    movie theater in town. The embassy had a movie projector and a very small
                    library of short subject films and the occasional full length film that we would
                    sometimes borrow and have friends over to watch movies.</p>
                <p>There were very few restaurants in Suva. There was one Chinese restaurant on the
                    main street that was called the Golden Dragon, which would seem to be the
                    regular place that people went if you were going out. Before we left, a little
                    American steakhouse, Biddy's, was opened. There were a couple of other places
                    that we would go now and then but really not very much at all. There were a
                    couple of very small, so-called department stores which were the old Australian
                    trading companieMorris Headstrom and Burns Philwhere we would do our shopping.
                    In Fiji, they drove on the left side of the street, a good British tradition. I
                    remember we wanted to get seatbelts put in our car. This was when we bought a
                    car there, in Fiji, that didn't come with seatbelts. They thought this was a
                    very strange concept, to want seatbelts, but they finally found some and
                    installed them for us and were very proud of having put in these bright red
                    seatbelts that clashed with the orange-ish interior of the car.</p>
                <p>Another event was the visit of Prince Charles. Then, he was still a very handsome
                    young man, very popular, a national hero in Fiji, I guess just by virtue of
                    taking the time to visit. I think it was on the Queen's birthday that he came
                    out, so there was a grand celebration given by the governor general on the big
                    lawn of the governor's mansion. It was quite nice.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of Peace Corps friends as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like a fun place to be in the Peace
                        Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>EICHER: I think it was a fun place to be a Peace Corps person. In some ways, we
                    even think that our own Fiji experience was as much Peace Corps as Foreign
                    Service. But, there were probably a hundred Peace Corps volunteers, most of whom
                    were just right out of university. We got to know quite a number of them, as
                    well as getting to be very good friends with the Peace Corps staff who were
                    based in Suva, who were also young people with young families like we were. One
                    of the volunteers, in fact, was a friend from high school who was there as a
                    volunteer with his wife, so that was a very interesting development. My wife and
                    I went out to see them on another island, Levuka, which was kind of a journey
                    away. We were adventurous and took a local bus and local ferry out to Levuka,
                    which was a trip of several hours altogether. Being the only Europeans
                    undertaking the trek, we got a lot of interesting looks from very friendly
                    Fijians who always wanted to talk and always wanted to stroke our son's
                    white-blond hair. We ended up seeing a lot Levuka, which had originally been the
                    capital of Fiji a hundred years ago, before they moved it to Suva, and where, in
                    fact, an early American consul had been based who died there in 1840's. We went
                    and found his grave; it's the kind of thing we go looking for in those places.
                    Levuka was one of Fiji's major cities, but it was a very small town. When we
                    asked our Peace Corps friends for directions to their house from the pier where
                    we would be landing, they laughed and said “just ask anyone where the Americans
                    live.” They were right; everyone knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fiji was not the center of operations during World War II.
                        It was off to one side but there were troops based there. Did World War II
                        have much impact and were you getting any reflections of the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not as much as I had expected, going to the South Pacific. I read
                    Michener's Tales of the South Pacific before I went, as well as other World War
                    II books about the South Pacific like Leon Uris's Battle Cry. You could see at
                    the airport that there were some hangers and things which they said were left
                    over from World War II. You even had seaplanes going in and out of Suva a little
                    bit and occasionally people would talk about how during the war there were a lot
                    of sea planes around. But it really, I guess, was much less a center of
                    operations than I might have imagined for such a big island. I guess the Pacific
                    is so big that it really was off the beaten track during the War.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Back to the Peace Corps for a moment, when I was in Nauru, my wife went to visit
                    our Peace Corps friends on another islanthe same friends had moved to a
                    different place because Levuka was too civilizeand they were now on a tiny
                    little island way, way off somewhere. She had an interesting cultural experience
                    going out there with our two little kids on a small inter-island boat that makes
                    the rounds. They had to take all their own food and supplies and stayed in a
                    very small village in a thatched hut. I guess having a European family there,
                    with kids, was a first for the island. She had to make her compliments to the
                    chief at a special dinner and was offered the dish of honor, which is to suck
                    the eye out a fish. But, being a woman, she was able to return the honor to the
                    chief saying, “No, no. You must do it, the honor is yours.” And so she avoided
                    that, which I have to admit, would have been a little worse than the sushi
                    experience I was having in Nauru at the same time. I didn't know how long she
                    was going to be out there because there is no schedule for the boats; once
                    you're there, you just have to wait until the next boat comes. One morning the
                    cry came up from the beach “the boat is here.” Then they loaded up her stuff and
                    got back on the boat to Suva. With that trip and her time in a village, she had
                    a much more real Fijian experience that I ever did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any typhoons or the equivalent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We had one hurricane. We had to tape up the windows and sliding glass
                    doors as a precaution against them shattering. There were also some tropical
                    storms. Most often, however, we just had lots and lots of rain. Fiji is one of
                    the wettest places in the world. Suva is on the wet side of Fiji and gets about
                    180 inches a year of rain. There were two seasons that they called “the wet
                    season” and “the rainy season;” those were the two seasons. During one it sort
                    of drizzled and rained all the time and during the other the days were bright
                    and sunny and then suddenly, boom, you had a tremendous downpour and
                    thunderstorm and then it would clear up again. There were beautiful South
                    Pacific sunsets, beautiful stars at night. It always seemed to me that the stars
                    are brighter in the southern hemisphere but I suppose it also had something to
                    do with less pollution and so forth.</p>
                <p>On the subject of typhoons, however, another of my jobs at the embassy was to be
                    disaster relief coordinator. I drafted the embassy's first disaster relief plan.
                    This was a long required report that had never been done before, that described
                    the types of disasters most likely to hit the country, and provided endless
                    details on airport and port locations and capacities, communications systems,
                    food stocks and many other things I can't remember off hand. The idea was to
                    have as much accurate and up-to-date information as possible on hand in case the
                    U.S. was suddenly called on to help out with a disaster. I remember that it
                    involved quite a bit of contact with various government ministries. As the
                    embassy's disaster relief coordinator, I was even sent to Manila for a couple of
                    days of disaster relief training. That was quite interesting, and got me to
                    another new country. There was no natural disaster while I was in Fiji, but
                    there was a big hurricane sometime after we left and I remember hearing later
                    that my plan was, in fact, used to some extent in helping the U.S. provide some
                    relief.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The end of 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I received my next assignment, which was Pretoria/Cape Town, by way
                    of Afrikaans training. So we headed back to the States, to Washington, where I
                    was going to take five months of Afrikaans and then African area studies before
                    heading off to South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1976 you are taking Afrikaans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That's right, starting at the beginning of 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think it was twenty four weeks; it may have been twenty two weeks. I
                    know that I had to leave the class a couple of weeks before it finished for
                    scheduling reasons that I don't fully remember anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Afrikaans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was fun. It was the first and only language I ever took at FSI. We had
                    a little class of five people. It wasn't a language that a lot of people took.
                    Only two of the five were State Department people, the other two were the
                    defense attach� and the air attach� and his wife. Unlike the more widespread
                    languages, there was only one Afrikaans teacher, so we had the same teacher all
                    the time. But, it's a fairly easy language, quite similar to Dutch but different
                    enough that it is its own language. For example, I couldn't really understand
                    Dutch people talking to each other, although I could pick up enough to know what
                    the subject was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How useful did you find knowing Afrikaans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was quite useful. There were, in fact, only two language-designated
                    positions in the whole State Department sections of the embassy and the three
                    consulates in South Africone position in the political section (mine) and one in
                    the economic sectiobecause, basically, everybody in South Africa could speak
                    English. As the only political officer who spoke Afrikaans, I was responsible
                    for following the parliament and the media and the press; the parliament, in
                    particular. Parliamentary debates were very heavily in Afrikaans. I got to the
                    point where I could quite reasonably read a newspaper or listen to the news or
                    understand a parliamentary debate without any difficulty, so that was quite
                    useful. In terms of everyday contacts, the Afrikaners were delighted to meet an
                    American who would speak to them in Afrikaans. They would beam about it; it was
                    so unusual and they were so happy that an American had taken the trouble to
                    learn their language. Afrikaners were very nationalistic and were proud of their
                    language. Then, after speaking with you in Afrikaans for a very few sentences,
                    they would switch back to English, knowing that they spoke English much better
                    than I spoke Afrikaans. So, I used it a lot, but never enough to be really
                    comfortable in an extended conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in South Africa as a political officer from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: From the middle of 1976 to the middle of 1978. I had one of two junior
                    positions in the political section. It was one of the half dozen embassy
                    positions that moved back and forth between Pretoria and Cape Town. The main
                    embassy was based in Pretoria but parliament met in Cape Town for six months of
                    the year, so for those six months the ambassador, the DCM, the political
                    counselor, myself, and a couple of secretaries and communicators would move from
                    Pretoria to Cape Town, while the rest of the embassy would remain in
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was still married, just one wife for 39 years now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out, family wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was tough and that was one of the reasons that we stayed only two
                    years in South Africa. We had two children when we arrived. One was school age,
                    he must've been in about second grade or so, and we put him into one of the
                    private English schools, English-language schools in Pretoria. Then, after six
                    months we moved him to Cape Town, to another English language school when we
                    moved down there, much to the distress of the headmaster of the Pretoria school.
                    He thought well, of course, we should board him. They thought the idea of
                    pulling him out was just horrifying because, of course, it was the English
                    tradition that you put your kids in boarding school at age 6 and they fend for
                    themselves. So, that must have been pretty tough on our son, Cameron, but he
                    seemed to adapt to it all right and got along fine. Our third son was actually
                    born in South Africa, in Cape Town, in Groote Schuur Hospital, the hospital
                    where they did the first ever heart transplant operation. The move every six
                    months must have been hard on my wife as well. She got a job with USIS in Cape
                    Town, but didn't have one in Pretoria. On the positive side, Cape Town was a
                    much nicer city than Pretoria. We liked it much better. So, there was some
                    advantage to moving down. Having the cross-country trip every six months also
                    enabled us to see much more of the country than we otherwise would have. The
                    embassy had a house for us in each city, which remained vacant when we weren't
                    there. It was very nice housing. The logistics of the move got easier after the
                    first time, since you were moving back to the same house you had been in before
                    and knew where you wanted to put everything and where to hang all the
                    pictures.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, 1976. What was the situation in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The Soweto riots broke out in the summer of 1976, just two or three weeks
                    before I was due to arrive in South Africa, which of course was a huge
                    event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>EICHER: All right. South Africa at the time was very much at the height of the
                    apartheid system, officially called “separate development,” but in fact a system
                    of very strict segregation, that was vigorously enforced through a very harsh
                    police apparatus. Apartheid affected all facets of lifwhere people could live,
                    or work, or eat, or go to school or to the movies, even what public benches they
                    could sit on. It was accompanied by a strict “pass system,” under which blacks
                    were officially not citizens of South Africa. Instead, they were assigned on a
                    tribal basis as citizens of small, unviable “homelands” or “Bantustans,” even if
                    they had lived all their lives in a South African city. They weren't permitted
                    in “white” areamost of the countrwithout a pass; if they didn't have a pass they
                    could be arrested and deported to a “homeland” that they might never even have
                    visited before. There was actually a policy of giving so-called independence to
                    the Bantustans. One, the Transkei, was already “independent” while we were there
                    and it was off limits to official Americans. The theory behind apartheid was
                    that if you could assign all the blacks to be citizens of these little,
                    independent countries that would be created, then the whites would be a majority
                    in South Africa and the blacks would have their own little countries, where they
                    could enjoy all the same rights and privileges that whites had in South Africa.
                    This was a pipe dream, of course.</p>
                <p>The Afrikaner-dominated Nationalist Party was firmly in control of the
                    government. It saw the policy of apartheid as a solution to the racial problem
                    in South Africa in the sense that it would strictly divide the races, reinforce
                    tribal divisions within the black community, and create a number of these
                    supposedly independent countries, which would provide a fa�ade to show the world
                    that the blacks really had equal rights. Aside from the Bantustans, the rest of
                    land in the countrabout 80%, I thinwould belong to the white population, which
                    was maybe 20% of the overall population. There was also a so-called “colored”
                    population, mixed race, and a quite large Indian population who also had their
                    separate classifications. So, there was very strict segregation as part of an
                    institutionalized social and political system at the time, and a very large and
                    brutal security establishment to enforce it.</p>
                <p>The Soweto riots of 1976 were the start of a very long period of serious urban
                    unrest in South Africa in opposition to the system. It was the first sustained,
                    widespread, black action in opposition to the regime. There had previously been
                    race riots in Soweto around 1960, but they were very short-lived. The unrest
                    following the 1976 Soweto riots continued for my entire tour of duty, on and
                    off, and led to sharp crackdowns and further restrictions of civil liberty, the
                    arrests of lots of leaders, and the banning of lots of organizations. It was a
                    very tense period, politically. After the riots in Soweta suburb of
                    Johannesburbroke out, rioting spread to other townships, or segregated suburbs,
                    all over South Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So these riots broke out in the summer of 1976, just as I was about to head out.
                    I remember getting a call from somebody at the State Department telling me that
                    it was important in view of the rioting that I cut my vacation short and get out
                    there just as soon as I possibly could. Being a young officer heading to my
                    second tour, I took this quite seriously and cut my vacation plans short. We got
                    ourselves to South Africa and arrived to the reaction of, “Oh my goodness. We
                    didn't expect to see you so soon.” And, you know, here I was, a young officer
                    fresh off the plane, riots in the townships all over the country, and there
                    wasn't really very much that I could do about it, even in terms of reporting. I
                    didn't know anybody yet. You couldn't actually go out and see what was going on
                    because they were rioting and we were supposed to stay away. So, that was one
                    more of those introductions to the Foreign Service. I learned to think very
                    carefully before changing vacation plans again to rush to a post.</p>
                <p>We faced a couple of other administrative problems on that transfer. Our trip was
                    right after the Israeli raid on Entebe airport, in Uganda. We were flying to
                    South Africa through Nairobi, where we took a rest stop for a day or two. When
                    we went to board the plane from Nairobi to Johannesburg, security was so tight
                    because of the raid on Entebe in neighboring Uganda that they would not let us
                    take a single item of carry-on with us on the plane. That was back in the days
                    when airport security was generally unknown, and you got on planes much the same
                    way you got on trains, with no special screening. So, the security measures were
                    really something. There we were with two small kids and a long flight ahead and
                    we weren't even allowed to take a little bag of toys or books. So it was a rough
                    flight, although our kids always traveled well. Then, when we arrived in South
                    Africa, we were met by the political counselor, Bob Munn, with a cable from the
                    Department that began “Due an incredible administrative error....” It turned out
                    they had shipped our household effects to Moscow instead of Pretoria! I think I
                    still have the cable, signed by Kissinger, who was secretary of state at the
                    time. We could never figure out how that mistake happened, unless South Africa
                    and the Soviet Union were next to each other on an alphabetic list and someone
                    entered the wrong code number. Anyway, the U.S. consulate in Goetburg, Sweden,
                    did some fancy footwork and had our effects unloaded in Sweden before the ship
                    entered the Soviet Union, and had them transshipped to South Africa. Still, it
                    was many months before we saw them. We had shipped everything months early in
                    hopes that it would be waiting for us when we arrived. So, we didn't even have a
                    crib for the baby; he quickly learned to sleep in a bed.</p>
                <p>One first impression of South Africa was making our way through the airport in
                    Johannesburg and seeing lots of police armed with machine guns. That was a real
                    eye-opener at the time and a signal of the government's siege mentality. These
                    days, there is such tight security at airports all over the world that you don't
                    look twice at armed security people any more. Back then, however, seeing men
                    armed with machine guns at an airport made you do a double-take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, what was your impression about the
                        South African government and where things were going and what the U.S. was
                        up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was kind of a tough relationship all around. The South Africans were
                    quite favorably inclined towards the United States but, of course, apartheid was
                    already an issue internationally and it was not a popular policy in the United
                    States. I went out there during the Ford Administration and relations were not
                    bad at all, but not nearly as good as the South African government would have
                    liked. This was still the Cold War era and the South African government was
                    rabidly anti-communist and so they thought that they should naturally be seen as
                    a strong and close ally by the United States and other Western countries.
                    However, because of apartheid, they were already a bit of a pariah and there
                    were various kinds of rather mild sanctions that were imposed on South Africa,
                    which increased during the time I was there. The sanctions included an arms
                    embargo, which resulted in the South Africans developing their own quite
                    effective arms industry. They built a lot of their own armaments, and according
                    to our military guys, it was very good. They also had good ties with Israel and
                    others, which enabled them to get arms and technology. They even cooperated with
                    the Chinese, I believe. There was also a sports embargo, at least an informal
                    one, of countries refusing to invite South African teams or to visit South
                    Africa, because South African teams were segregated. Interestingly, this seemed
                    to bother the South Africans the most because they were a very sporting nation
                    and couldn't stand the idea that their teams were not able to compete
                    internationally. In fact, one of the first thing to be integrated by the
                    government was the international sporting teams, in hopes of getting some teams
                    to play internationally. Occasionally, they would find an international team
                    willing to come to South Africa and whenever they did, it was a big deal for
                    them. I remember some confusion when the New Zealand “All Blacks” Rugby Team
                    came to South Africa. The “All Blacks” got their name because they wore black
                    uniforms, not because there were any black members of the team. The visit
                    prompted many countries around the world to start boycotting New Zealand sports
                    until there was some kind of an apology over the visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were our ambassador and DCM when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>EICHER: Our ambassador was Bill Bowdler, who was a career ambassador, a very
                    distinguished, good fellow, who, I think, had spent most of his career in Latin
                    America. The DCM was Bill Edmondson, who left within a few weeks after we got
                    there and was replaced some months later by Harvey Nelson, who was an old Africa
                    hand; we became good friends with him and his wife. Nelson was also a career
                    officer, who went on to become ambassador in Swaziland. Edmonson, interestingly,
                    returned as ambassador to South Africa a few weeks before the end of my
                    assignment there, so I served with him there as both DCM and ambassador,
                    although briefly in both cases. All three of them were good professionals and
                    good guys. I learned a lot from working with them, especially since it was my
                    first assignment as a political officer and I didn't really know the ropes. I
                    certainly saw more of them than almost all the other embassy officers did, since
                    I was also with them in Cape Town for six months a year, where the embassy had
                    just a tiny staff, only four substantive officers, including me and the
                    ambassador and DCM. As a result, in Cape Town, even as a very junior officer, I
                    was attending the Ambassador's morning staff meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in INR in the late '60s and had the general
                        impressiothis was not deep analysithat one of these days there's going to be
                        a night of long knives in South Africa. I mean, this was kind of the idea
                        that you can't sit on a volcano forever and reconcile it. What was the
                        feeling about this, you know, in talking with your fellow officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That was certainly the feeling I went out with. The feeling from the
                    outside was that the situation was completely intractable and at some point it
                    would explode or implode and you would have, indeed, an extremely bloody
                    revolution on your hands. Of course, a low-level violent opposition was already
                    underway through the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist
                    Congress (PAC), the so-called liberation movementbut generally the security
                    forces had these well in hand; the liberation movements were winning the battle
                    of public opinion in the UN and outside the country, but they were not effective
                    within the country. And, of course, with the Soweto riots and the spread of
                    unrest to other urban areas around the country, some people thought this could
                    be the beginning of the violent end. Our view at the embassy was more
                    restrained. We knew the riots were serious and were an indication of the
                    inherent instability built into the system, but the overwhelming preponderance
                    of power was still with the whites; the rioters weren't going to be able to
                    topple the government and its security apparatus, certainly not in the short
                    term.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>On the white side, most of the power was still in the hands of the older
                    generation of Afrikaner politicians who were committed to apartheid as the
                    solution to South Africa's racial problem. However, there was already starting
                    to be the first signs of a split in the Nationalist Party, although “split” is
                    probably too strong a word. The party was still solid, but what was happening
                    was that a group of younger and more enlightened Afrikaners were emerging as a
                    new generation within the Nationalist Party, who realized that they had a big
                    problem and didn't have the answer. They didn't know what the answer was, yet,
                    but they kneunlike the previous generation which was still in power at the
                    timthat over the long term apartheid was just not going to work. They were not
                    going to be able to corral the black population into Bantustans and have that be
                    an effective policy. These younger politicians, many of whom were already
                    members of parliament for the National Party, but were still backbenchers, not
                    actually in positions of power, were called the “verligtes,” an Afrikaans word
                    meaning “enlightened,” and we hoped and believed they represented the future of
                    the Nationalist Party. They represented a chance that white politics could
                    develop in positive way and avoid the “night of the long knives.”</p>
                <p>On the black side, beyond the ANC and PAC, you saw a very strong sense of “we
                    want our share, we want our rights, we want justice,” but, surprisingly, this
                    was not coupled with a strong desire for revenge or retribution, as you might
                    expect. There was a whole new black political movement emerging out of the
                    Soweto riots, the so-called “black consciousness movement,” which was an
                    internal opposition that continued to crystallize. Most of the leaders of the
                    ANC and PAC were in exile or in prison. They were becoming increasingly
                    irrelevant as a new, younger leadership emerged within Sough Africa. Steve Biko
                    was perhaps the best known name among them but there was a very large group of
                    younger generation people in all the townships around the country who were
                    emerging into informal political leadership positions.</p>
                <p>So, getting back to your original question, there was indeed a danger of a very
                    bloody revolution in South Africa, but at the same time we saw that the
                    combination of the young Afrikaners looking for solutions and the moderate
                    blacks who were not seeking vengeance might still provide an opportunity for a
                    peaceful way out. Even then we could see that as a possibility, so contrary to
                    the general outside impression, it did not seem to us at the embassy that it was
                    a hopeless case, bound for major bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often when you come to a situation where things are
                        changing, it's the junior officers at the embassy who sort of get out and
                        around more than the more senior officers, who are sort of trapped in their
                        positions of the establishment. And so they often depend on the junior
                        officers to really get out and take soundings and all that. Did you find
                        that situation in South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>EICHER: We did, yes. I wouldn't say that the more senior officers were not
                    connected; the Ambassador and DCM certainly did have access and knew top people
                    on all sides of the color bar. Where they did not really know people, where it
                    was hardest to know people, was in the emerging black leadership, that is, the
                    young radicals in the townships. There, I think it certainly was the more junior
                    officers who were getting out much more and knew people better. The more junior
                    officers tended to be more radical, if you will, more anti-apartheid, or at
                    least more apt to be actively or outspokenly anti-apartheid, than the more
                    senior officers did. It was to a large extent up to the younger officers to get
                    out into the townships and meet people and find out what was going on. That was
                    my role in Pretoria. In Cape Town, I was much more following Parliament and the
                    Afrikaner establishment. I was in a particularly interesting position because I
                    got to see both sides. The other less senior political officers and I did, in
                    fact, continually try to push upon the higher-ups in the embassy the importance
                    of giving greater credence to the new black leaders, and to push American policy
                    toward a more equitable stance, and to press the South Africans to more
                    reasonable policies. It wasn't that the embassy top leadership supported
                    apartheid in any way; they didn't, of course. But, by virtue of their age, or
                    their experience, or their professional standing, or greater commitment to
                    reflect the carefully balanced U.S. policy, or whatever, they were just more
                    restrained and more careful. In some ways, that translated to us a position that
                    wasn't sufficiently anti-apartheid. I should say here that the Ambassador and
                    DCM always seemed sympathetic to our positions, even if they often didn't go
                    along with us. Some others in the embassy came across much more as supporters of
                    the South African regime. And, the nature of the country was generally that the
                    people in the embassy who were not specifically assigned to follow black affairs
                    would be unlikely to meet educated blacks at all.</p>
                <p>I remember at one point we had some internal dissent concerning a visit to South
                    Africa by Henry Kissinger, who was secretary of state then. The country team was
                    setting up Kissinger's schedule, including a meeting with a number of prominent
                    black leaders which was, of course, something he had to do, even though as far
                    as we could tell he himself was not much interested in doing that. He was coming
                    to see the government leaders and this was really just a token meeting with
                    blacks. Three of us in the political sectiothere were only four officers the
                    political section, the counselor and three younger officerwere aghast when we
                    saw this list of black leaders, which was a list of very nice people but didn't
                    include people from the emerging leadership, nobody who we considered among the
                    real, more credible leaders of black South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Using the American term, more Uncle Toms and that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, that's what we would have said at the time and probably did say at
                    the time. In retrospect they weren't necessarily Uncle Toms at all, of course,
                    but they were people who had reached senior positions in society without
                    offending the government sufficiently to be banned or otherwise persecuted. I
                    remember the three of us writing a joint memo to the ambassador telling him we
                    were unhappy with the choice of participants in the meeting. He took it
                    seriously enough to meet with us and ask for names of people that Kissinger
                    ought to meet with. It was kind of tough for us. We came up with some names, but
                    many of the ones that we had come up with were either in jail or they were so
                    young and unknown that I guess it didn't make a sufficient impression on the
                    ambassador. One, however, that we really pressed, because of its symbolism, was
                    Robert Sobukwe, who was the head of the Pan-Africanist Congress. He was not in
                    jail but was banned, meaning that he was restricted to a very small area and
                    only could meet with one or two people at a time and could not go far from his
                    home. I remember the ambassador saying, “You know, Sobukwe has been banned for
                    many years. He's really kind of out of it. Besides that, he's in Kimberley and,
                    you know, we couldn't work it out logistically.” So they went ahead with their
                    Uncle Tom meeting with Kissinger. We didn't win that one and we thought that was
                    the end of the story.</p>
                <p>But, when the embassy made its annual move down to Cape Town a few months later,
                    the ambassador actually stopped in Kimberley himself and met with Robert
                    Sobukwe. I remember meeting the ambassador afterwardI was the only one of the
                    three who signed the memo who was part of the embassy's Cape Town contingenand
                    him saying, “Oh, I was so impressed with Robert Sobukwe. You'd be amazed at how
                    plugged in he is to what's going on.” We felt a little moral victory there,
                    proud, but it was a little too late.</p>
                <p>I can't remember specifically what it was that Kissinger came for or what
                    prompted his visit, but it was certainly part of the general effort to try to
                    improve American-South African relations by getting the South Africans to
                    lighten up their apartheid policies a little bit, at the margins at least, and
                    make them a little bit more internationally acceptable so that we could
                    cooperate with them. The visit was also probably connected to the effort to find
                    a solution to the Rhodesia problem. It was my first ever SecState visit, so that
                    was interesting for me. Of course, we had control officers for different events
                    and teams that had to be at the hotel all night long just in case something came
                    up. I remember one of the middle-of-the-night jobs I had was scanning all the
                    newspapers and the wire services and pulling out stories that might be worthy of
                    being read by the secretary and his team. On top of each news report we
                    selected, we had to attach an index card summarizing the article in one sentence
                    for them. One amusing story I got on my watch was the incident when Vice
                    President Rockefeller got angry with some demonstrators and gave them the
                    finger, which was caught on film by some photographer. I carefully pulled the
                    story out and put a card on the top saying “the vice president put his finger
                    into a sticky ethical controversy.” That's about all I remember of the Kissinger
                    visit. I was not in any of the meetings and only saw the secretary walk by at a
                    large gathering. I don't remember him taking time to meet or greet the people at
                    the Embassy; that would not have been Kissinger's style.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sort of compare and contrast the situation from
                        your viewpoint in Pretoria and in Cape Town?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: You mean the political situation?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes and sort of the ambience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: In general, Pretoria is very much a government town. It's small and
                    quiet. The sidewalks kind of roll up at five o'clock and everybody goes home.
                    The big metropolis which was the commercial and financial center, Johannesburg,
                    was about an hour down the road. Pretoria did have its own black townships,
                    which were also very much in turmoil and it was in the Pretoria townships that I
                    got to know most of my black contacts. In fact, since Johannesburg was a much
                    bigger city with much bigger townships, the more important leaders emerged in
                    the Johannesburg townships such as Soweto rather than in Pretoria, but those
                    were generally covered by the consulate in Johannesburg rather than by us in
                    Pretoria. We also had a consulate in Durban that followed events in Natal
                    Province, which included most of South Africa's Indian population and most of
                    the Zulus, as well as a good proportion of the English-speaking whites. There
                    was also a full-time consulate in Cape Town. Cape Town is a wonderful, beautiful
                    city, or at least it was at the time. It's right on the ocean, surrounded by
                    pretty little mountains, which makes for a spectacular setting. Unlike Pretoria
                    and Johannesburg and the other cities up north which weren't settled until the
                    19th century, Cape Town has a lot of history, buildings going back hundreds of
                    years, a lot more character, including what they call the Cape Dutch influence
                    in the architecture, little flower alleys, cobblestone streets, the Parliament
                    Buildings and beaches and vineyards nearby. It was a much more cosmopolitan kind
                    of city. Cape Town had a big “colored,” or mixed race, population who were the
                    majority in Cape Town at the time. The “coloreds” were also restricted and
                    segregated, but not as heavily as the blacks, so you had a feeling that, in a
                    sense, Cape Town was a bit more open and liberal than Pretoria was. It certainly
                    was a much more pleasant city. We always said that as bad as it was to move back
                    and forth between Cape Town and Pretoria every six months, the advantage was
                    that we got to spend six months of every year in Cape Town, which most embassy
                    people did not. It really was a much nicer place to be than Pretoria.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Politics were not quite as rough there either, although they did have their
                    problems in Cape Town as well, and they did have riots in their townships.
                    Generally, events in those townships were followed by the consular staff in Cape
                    Town. In Cape Town, my own portfolio shifted radically and my main issue to
                    follothe reason I was therwas parliament, which met just about every day. So, I
                    would spend a lot of time going down to parliament. I got to know a lot of
                    parliamentarians and a lot of the media folks who followed parliament. Since I
                    was only about 26 or so, I tended to meet a lot of the young backbenchers more
                    than the powerful leaders, but there were a lot of interesting people there. I
                    knew Frederick de Klerk, who much later became prime minister and won the Nobel
                    Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela for bringing about a peaceful transition. I took
                    him to lunch one day, just the two of us. He was still a backbencher but was
                    already known as a young “verligte” who seemed to be going places. Frankly, I
                    was less impressed with him than with some of the other backbenchers. I got to
                    be pretty good friends with a couple of others who ended up as cabinet ministers
                    in later years but were backbenchers at the time. These were the kind of people
                    who gave me the sense that they wanted to try to find a solution other than
                    apartheid, which they could see was not working. Or, at least, some of them did.
                    The parliament was so heavily dominated by the Afrikaners, the Nationalist
                    Party, that the opposition was practically meaningless. There may have been 20
                    or 30 opposition members out of a couple of hundred members of parliament. The
                    real hope was for a change within the Nationalist Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this group, described sometimes as “the great
                        white tribe of Africa,” the Afrikaner, was there a good solid generational
                        gap growing among them? I would assume the hard-liners were the older group
                        and the young people had other ideas, because, I mean, it's not much fun
                        being so isolated and widely condemned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That's true. You could see this split starting to emerge among the
                    Afrikaners. It wasn't quite so clearly the younger folks against the older
                    folks, but certainly the older folks tended to be in the “verkrampte” or
                    hard-line camp, and the younger folks tended to have a more enlightened
                    viewpoint. This still was not a liberal view, by any means; it's not as though
                    they wanted to bring down the Afrikaner power structure or even bring an
                    immediate end to apartheid. But it was still significant to see quite a number
                    of younger Afrikaners questioning the system, not in the sense of protest or
                    vigorous opposition, but in the sense that they could tell is wasn't working, it
                    wasn't going to be a long term solution. They were starting to search for an
                    answer that would allow the country to move ahead peacefully and end apartheid
                    without damaging their own interests and lifestyle and future. They were still
                    afraid of taking steps to open things up in a way that might get out of control
                    and lead to revolution. When I got there, John Vorster was prime minister. He
                    was one of the architects of apartheid. He was very strongly conservative. He
                    retired, while I was still there, he was replaced by P. W. Botha, who was also
                    belligerently pro-apartheid. You just saw an increasing bunker mentality among
                    the older folks, which was disturbing to some of the younger ones.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>When I mention the bunker mentality, I'm not only talking about the bad image
                    South Africa had in the world and the increasing number of sanctions against it,
                    but there were also at the time the liberation struggles going on all over
                    southern Africa. Although the ANC and PAC were not very successful in bringing
                    the liberation struggle into South Africa proper, there was some active fighting
                    against white regimes going on in South West AfricNamibia, which South Africa
                    controlleas well as in Rhodesia, which had declared its independence and which
                    South Africa was helping. Mozambique and Angola were still Portuguese
                    territories until about a year before I got to South Africa, so there had been
                    fighting, liberation struggles, in both of those. There was still fighting going
                    on in both Angola and Mozambique while I was there, not against the Portuguese,
                    who had left, but among the different liberation movements in Angola, and
                    between the government and a rebel group backed by the white Rhodesians in
                    Mozambique. There were still many South African troops in Namibia and they had
                    made incursions deep into Angola. In fact, some South Africans once told me that
                    they were with the military forces that went so far into Angola that they could
                    see the lights of Luanda, which is all the way up at the north of Angola. They
                    had gotten that far into Angola. They never admitted that publicly. So there
                    was, in fact, a real war going on in the region, which contributed to the bunker
                    mentality. The South Africans considered themselves a bastion against these
                    communist-backed liberation movements and couldn't understand why the West
                    didn't take their side, since they claimed to be fighting Soviet surrogates.</p>
                <p>The Cubans were already in Angola at that point and the South Africans were
                    vehemently anti-Cuban. I had one funny incident with that. I remember being
                    taken to lunch in the Parliament's official dining room at one point by one of
                    my South African parliamentarian friends, a young and very conservative fellow
                    named Albert Nothnagel. We had a lovely lunch there and afterwards the waiter
                    came around with a box of cigars and I said “They're probably Cuban cigars, ha,
                    ha.” He looked very offended and he called the waiter over and took a look and
                    sure enough, these were Cuban cigars that they were serving in the South African
                    Parliament, while their soldiers were up fighting the Cubans near the Namibian
                    border. Nothnagel looked quite embarrassed. I suspect that he did something to
                    stop that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the coloreds have any representation? Was there any
                        kind of contact? How did they fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>EICHER: The coloreds, or mixed-race people, had no clout but, in fact, they were
                    one of the chinks in the ideological armor of apartheid. I can't remember what
                    the proportions of the population were; I think there were substantially fewer
                    coloreds than whites. But it was a situation where the coloreds were not
                    suitably accommodated by the apartheid structure. They did have their own
                    political assembly of some kind but because they didn't have a specific
                    geographical area to go with it, it just didn't quite fit in into the grand
                    theory of apartheid, that all people would be equal in their own territories.
                    Most of the coloreds were in the Cape Town area, but they were not limited to
                    that. It was accepted that they would have to be part of “white” South Africa
                    over the long term, even though apartheid's restrictions clearly made them
                    second class citizens. Coloreds had their own facilitieseparate living areas,
                    train cars, and so fortseparate from the blacks and whites. The same went for
                    South Africa's Indian population, as well, which was concentrated in the Durban
                    area. The Afrikaners hoped the coloreds and Indians would identify more with the
                    whites than the blacks and therefore accept apartheid even if they didn't like
                    it. In fact, it didn't really work that way; most politically active coloreds
                    identified with the blacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, how about the, I don't know, is it called
                        the “English group?” I'm sure they were as articulate as all hell, but did
                        they have any particular influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not a lot. You know, they tended politically to be in opposition to the
                    Afrikaner establishment, to condemn apartheid, and to want a more just system.
                    They wanted to share power, but it wasn't clear exactly how they planned to do
                    this or what final result they were looking for. They didn't have a master plan
                    and it wasn't necessarily clear that they all wanted to completely get rid of
                    the system of white control. In addition to the liberals, there was a white
                    English partgosh, I have forgotten the name of iwhich in years past had run the
                    South African government. But it was reduced to a small opposition by the time I
                    got there. During the election while I was there, they were thoroughly trounced
                    by the Nationalist Party and even lost to the more liberal, generally English,
                    party which then took over as the official opposition. Again, by that time there
                    was, as I say, maybe 30 opposition members of Parliament. They could have their
                    say and often made very good points in debate, but they had no power to block
                    anything the government wanted to do. Overall, the opposition actually lost
                    seats to the Nationalist Party during the election while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find life in Cape Town? There might be people
                        who would feel this is an abhorrent regime but life is pretty good I mean,
                        if you happened to be white, English-speaking.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, that's right. You could say that throughout South Africa, in
                    general, living conditions for the foreign diplomats were extremely pleasant.
                    Things are very cheap, everything was available, and housing was excellent;
                    almost everybody at the embassy had a swimming pool at their house. Those of us
                    who moved every six months had two houses, of course. We had one in Pretoria and
                    one in Cape Town, which remained empty half the year when we were in the other
                    place. There were good restaurants, good food, excellent wine, very, very cheap.
                    We had wine we liked from the Western Cape for a couple of dollars a bottle. It
                    was so cheap partly because the South Africans had trouble finding export
                    markets because of their apartheid policy. There were all of the good colonial
                    thingsporting clubs, servants. There were nice beaches and game parks. It was a
                    lovely place to live if you were white and if you could close your eyes to the
                    political situation, which, in fact, a disturbing number of Americans did,
                    including at the embassy.</p>
                <p>Those of us who followed politics tended to find it depressing after a while. It
                    was a one issue country. You couldn't have a discussion at a lunch or a cocktail
                    party or any conversation that didn't come back to apartheid. That was the only
                    issue. In one sense, it made it very easy to be a political officer there
                    because everybody was dying to tell you their side of the story and give you
                    their arguments. You didn't have to dig. We were very well received by
                    everybody, black and white and Afrikaner and English. I never had any trouble
                    making contacts. I remember at first being a little nervous because I was a very
                    young, inexperienced American officer being expected to follow parliament, which
                    was this august institution of senior South African leaders. But, you know, I
                    would call up and ask some parliamentarian I had never met to lunch and they
                    would say well, yes, of course. No problem. We would invite people to our house
                    and it would be the first time the whites had ever met or talked with an
                    educated black, or perhaps any black other than servants. It tended to be an
                    eye-opener for them. So, you would feel like you were doing a little bit of
                    good, opening a dialogue and making the whites see things a bit differently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could then entertain? I would assume it was our policy
                        wasn't it, to make sure that we got our views across to all sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Absolutely. You tried to entertain everybody. You had to do much of it at
                    home, of course, because the blacks were not allowed into the restaurants
                    downtown. In fact, they were just starting to make the first exceptions to that
                    when we were there, as well. There were a few designated hotels and restaurants
                    around the country open to all races, very few; I think there was only one in
                    all of Pretoria. It was the best hotel in town. Since it was so expensive, there
                    was no danger that many blacks would actually go there. But, in line with the
                    development of apartheid, if you're going to have the black president of one of
                    the homelands or other African countries come to Pretoria, he had to have some
                    place reasonable he could stay. So, in theory you could entertain blacks at one
                    or two hotels but it was very rare. Basically, you had to do that kind of
                    entertaining at home, which we did a lot of.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We had some black friends in Pretoria who we invited down to join us in Cape
                    Town. They were young folks like us and came down and stayed with us for a few
                    days and it was difficult because you couldn't go to the restaurants together;
                    we weren't supposed to go to the same beach with them; we couldn't go to the
                    movies with them. Everything was so completely segregated. They were
                    forward-leaning folks and there were some fairly deserted beaches around Cape
                    Town, and so I do remember we spent a little time on a rather deserted beach,
                    but it was a very uncomfortable way to have to be looking over your shoulder
                    expecting trouble. Sometimes it would really strike you. While our friends were
                    visiting us in Cape Town, he was out front washing his car in our driveway and
                    our neighbor came over to ask if “our boy” could also wash her car when he was
                    finished. It was hard for us; I can't imagine how hard it must have been for
                    them.</p>
                <p>I remember once seeing a merry-go-round set up someplace that, as with many
                    things in South Africa, had a sign on it saying “whites only” and I remember a
                    little black child just watching the merry-go-round going around. There were
                    lots of things like that. It got to be heart-rending, and worse. You know, we
                    got to know more and more people who ended up in jail, or exiled, or even dead.
                    So, although living conditions were very nice for us, it got to be quite a
                    depressing place and that was the reason, along with the move back and forth
                    every six months, which caused us to leave at the end of two years instead of
                    extending.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find interest on both sides of the apartheid
                        divide in America's wrestling with racial discrimination? I mean, we were
                        certainly working on the issue and in the '70s and, I mean, this was still
                        very much a work in progress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We found that white South Africans referred to America's racial situation
                    quite a bit, but didn't see it as a model of what they could do but rather along
                    the lines of “you've got your problems, so how can you criticize us?” In fact,
                    they would make a point of saying that our situation was not same as theirs at
                    all. They would say that American blacks weren't really blacks at all, but
                    “mulattoes,” or “coloreds” and, of course, coloreds are much more civilized and
                    much easier to deal with than real African blacks. So, in their eyes, Americans
                    could not claim to have experience that was really relevant to what they were
                    going through.</p>
                <p>I remember getting once a telephone call from some irate persoas we do in every
                    embasscomplaining about U.S. policy and asking how we could be critical of South
                    Africa when we in the U.S. would never let a black be in a position of
                    authority. The caller said that in the U.S. military, we would never let a black
                    be a pilot, for example. I told him we already had black generals. He laughed
                    and said “that's nonsense” and hung up. So that's just one small example of
                    their not understanding the U.S. experience or seeing it as something relevant
                    to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the U.S. policy toward South Africa became a huge domestic
                    issue in South Africa. While I was there, the American administration changed
                    from Gerry Ford to Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter took a much more principled
                    position on South Africa, a harder line, and incensed the Afrikaners. There was
                    a South African election shortly after Jimmy Carter became president and the
                    Nationalist Party basically ran their campaign as if they were running against
                    Jimmy Cartedenouncing him and his policy constantlrather than running against
                    the irrelevant white opposition. Using this anti-Carter approach, they won by a
                    landslide and ended up in an even stronger position in parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, both in the Ford and Carter administrations, get
                        Congressional visitors, particularly, well, I mean, from both sides of the
                        spectrum but basically, black leaders coming down there to make a point or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We did get quite a lot of congressional visitors. I was involved with
                    some of them and not others. I remember we had Charlie Diggs, of Michigan, who
                    was a prominent congressmaI think he was head of the Black Caucuwho was later
                    convicted of something corrupt and I think sent to jail. I remember being not at
                    all impressed with him. But, he was trying to burnish his credentials as a kind
                    of a liberation leader, or a sympathetic soul, or whatever. I was his control
                    officer. I had him over to my house to meet a bunch of my black contacts. It was
                    easier for them to come to the house than to the embassy. After the meeting he
                    left them all with a handshake and told them “good work, keep at it and if you
                    need anything, there is a black officer at the American Embassy you should
                    contact.” And when he said this he was sitting in my house with my contacts, my
                    friends, so I took great offense at Charlie Diggs.</p>
                <p>There was another congressman whose name I don't remembeSykes, maybe? who I was
                    control officer for. I remember the big problem I had with him was that he
                    wanted to go on a lion hunt while he was in South Africa. Of course, hunting
                    lions is something that's not easy to do these days, or even back then, even in
                    South Africa. In the game parks you're not allowed to hunt. But, the South
                    Africans would bend over backwards to try to be helpful to a friendly U.S.
                    congressman, which he was. So, one of our military attach�s pulled a few strings
                    and the South Africans actually set up a lion hunt for this guy. It took a lot
                    of effort on our side, and probably on theirs, to get it done. Of course, you
                    can never just go back and tell a congressman that his request is unreasonable.
                    Anyway, he got there and decided that well, he'd better not go on this lion hunt
                    after all, because it might look bad to the folks back home if news got out that
                    he was in South Africa hunting lions on the taxpayers' dollars. After we set the
                    whole thing up we had to cancel it again! That's the only memory I have of that
                    particular congressman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. At least the lions came out ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>EICHER: The lions came out ahead. The biggest visit while I was there was Vice
                    President Mondale and this was kind of a seminal point in U.S.-South African
                    relations. He was coming out to South Africa to make another effort to try to
                    nudge them enough in the right direction that they would start to become
                    acceptable internationally. He was very carefully briefed. The big issue for
                    those preparing the visit was how to draw the balance in U.S. policy between a
                    desire for majority rule and wanting to achieve this through peaceful evolution.
                    The idea of the trip was for Mondale to pressure and encourage the government to
                    do the right thing, move in the right direction. There was not a desire to break
                    entirely with the white South African government or even to worsen relations
                    with them, although the subtext of the visit was that if they didn't improve,
                    relations would inevitably get worse. So, there was a lot of emphasis during the
                    trip preparations on what sound bites to use and not to use. For example, the
                    white South Africans were particularly averse to the idea of “one man, one
                    vote,” since they saw it as a formula for an immediate black takeover and their
                    relegation to insignificance. So, U.S. policy, under both Ford and Carter was to
                    avoid publicly using the formula “one man, one vote,” which would just get a
                    nasty reaction and prevent further dialogue. So, instead, the U.S. position was
                    couched in kind of diplomatic terms that, you know, all South Africans had to
                    find a just solution for sharing power. They have to work on it together. It had
                    to be a solution that's acceptable to all South Africans. We used these kinds of
                    formulations as a matter of policy, to shy away from the “one-man, one-vote”
                    issue to the extent we could, because using that term would just convince the
                    South Africans that we were in favor of black revolution and having the whites
                    swept away; that's what “one man, one vote” meant to them. “One man, one vote in
                    a unitary state,” I think, was the line they used to use to describe an endgame
                    that would be totally impossible for them to negotiate.</p>
                <p>So anyway, Mondale came out, he had a series of meetings, and everything went
                    pretty well. In his farewell press conference a journalist, in fact, one of my
                    good friends from the parliamentary journalist corps, asked him, “Mr. Mondale.
                    Are you saying that we should have one-man, one-vote?” and Mondale said, “Yes.”
                    So, because of that one answer, the headlines about the visit were all negative
                    in the white South African press; the South Africans were up in arms and the
                    visit was kind of a diplomatic disaster. Nobody could believe that after Mondale
                    was briefed so carefully, he had gone out there and supported “one man, one
                    vote,” which effectively cut off further discussion, as far as the South
                    Africans were concerned. On the other hand, we young political officers were
                    just elated and so was most of the black community. Relations with the South
                    African government from that point onward for with the rest of my tour took an
                    absolute nosedive and our relations with the non-white communities of South
                    Africa improved by the same token. So that was a very interesting kind of
                    turning point in U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>There was one other small point that happened about the same time, or a bit
                    later. The U.S. had always described the apartheid system as “abhorrent.” The
                    South Africans didn't like this, of course, and begged us to come up with
                    another term. So, someone in Washington came up with the term “repugnant,” which
                    we started using, even though the South Africans thought that was even worse.
                    They didn't ask us again to come up with new terms.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a black officer at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We did have a black officer at the embassy. In fact, we had two in South
                    Africa; one at the embassy and one at the consulate in Johannesburg; they were
                    the second and third black officers to serve in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: One was Richard Baltimore, who was one of my young colleagues in the
                    political section in Pretoria; in fact, he was part-time consular officer and
                    part-time political. The other was Joseph Segars, who was the consular officer
                    at the consulate in Johannesburg. There had been one black officer previously,
                    who left just before I got there. He was an economic officer in Pretoria. His
                    name, I don't remember. He had been the first. So, the South Africans were
                    starting to get used to this, to some extent, at least. There were also a couple
                    of other black diplomats in town, an Ambassador from Malawi, I think, and a
                    couple of “diplomats” from the Transkei, which was the first of the
                    “independent” homelands.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I spent a lot of time with them, especially with Rich Baltimore.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I've lost track of him. I heard that he was retired. He spent years in
                    the Middle East and I'm not quite sure where he physically is these days.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I spent a lot of time especially with him since we were in the political section
                    together. He was a gregarious sort of guy and was very forward in his approach
                    to the racial problems in South Africa. He loved going out to lunch with me to
                    different places every time, just to be there and insist that he was entitled to
                    stay, just to make sure places had been integrated a bit, even if they were
                    still off limits to South African non-whites. By that time, there have been
                    enough publicity in South Africa about black diplomats that there wasn't much
                    trouble; nobody... well, I think once or twice we had a little trouble, but not
                    any serious trouble. We were asked to leave at least once but we stayed and
                    insisted. We were never actually thrown out of a place. He always liked to get
                    the most prominent table possible. He liked to do things that would just outrage
                    the Afrikaners, to drive around town in his sports car convertible, and to date
                    white girls. Joe Segars, in Johannesburg, was a lot more low key. I didn't get
                    to know him as well at the time since he was in a different city. He had his
                    family with hia wife and small soand that must've been extremely tough for
                    him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in your work that there were sort of tribal
                        politics that were going on between the Zulus and others? I mean, did this
                        play any particular role or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, it did, to some extent. Tribal politics were important especially
                    within the context of the Bantustan system, which was going very strong while we
                    were there. The first of the Bantustans, the Transkei, the Xhosa homeland, got
                    its independence while I was there, or right before. The others were slated to.
                    It was indeed, a big political issue at the time. A few black leaders had bought
                    on to the idea. Some of them might sincerely have felt that they would be better
                    off running their own homeland than as part of the oppressive South African
                    system. So, you did have some “presidents” of homelands, and some blacks who
                    were elected to homeland councils. Aside from Transkei, the most prominent was
                    Kwazulu, the Zulu homeland in Natal, which was headed by the most prominent
                    tribal leader, Gatsha Buthelezi. In general, the tribally-based leaders were
                    seen by the urban blacks as “Uncle Toms.” There was a debate within the Embassy
                    about whether Buthelezi was an Uncle Tom or a liberation movement leader. He led
                    a Zulu-based organization called Inkatha, which he styled a liberation movement.
                    He was outspokenly anti-apartheid and was certainly a strong leader among the
                    Zulus, so he was something of a problem for the South Africans. But, at the same
                    time, he was acting within the system, as a leader of one of the so-called
                    Bantustans. I remember arguing with the consul general from Durban, who thought
                    Buthelezi was a liberation movement leader, while we in the political section
                    saw him as more in the Uncle Tom category because that's how he was regarded by
                    the urban blacks, who thought that he had sold out by accepting tribal politics
                    and a position as a homeland tribal leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Also, I remember there were policy discussions about whether or not Americans
                    would to be allowed to visit or even drive through the independent Bantustans.
                    It was decided that official Americans would not be allowed to visit. This met
                    with some unhappiness from a lot of people in the embassy community because they
                    felt we should be more supportive of South African policy and why shouldn't we
                    be going to these places? But, in the larger scheme of things, I think we in the
                    political section saw the Bantustans as largely irrelevant. Tribal politics were
                    going on, but they were really a side issue. We didn't spend a lot of time
                    reporting on them. The real black political movements at the time were
                    developing in the townships with the new black leadership, and the urban blacks
                    rejected the whole notion of sub-ethnicity or tribal identity within the black
                    community.</p>
                <p>Now, interestingly, at the same time, many young blacks were abandoning their
                    English names and taking up African names, which may or may not have been part
                    of their “official,” birth certificate names. For example, our good friend
                    Victor Masipa, one of the national employees at the embassy, became Mokhedi
                    Masipa. We became friends with lots of his friends, who had also changed their
                    names from Cyril or John or whatever, to Africa names. This was all part of the
                    growing black consciousness movement. You could tell it was new, and it was even
                    funny sometimes, because they would introduce themselves with African names and
                    then out of habit call each other by their English names. But, if you asked any
                    of them what ethnic group or tribe they came from, they would become
                    uncomfortable; they really didn't like the idea of tribal politics. Perhaps that
                    will turn out being a saving grace for South Africa compared to so many other
                    African countries where tribalism is still such a problem. In South Africa,
                    apartheid gave tribal politics such a bad name that perhaps it will be less
                    likely to cause the kinds of divisions in the country that you see so many other
                    places.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume that naval visits were out at the question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Naval visits were out of the question, I believe, yes. We did have a
                    naval attach� and an Army attach� and an Air Force attach�. There was actually
                    even a little attach� airplane that they used to go flying around the country.
                    They had quite good relations with the South African military. There was a big
                    South African navy base near the Cape of Good Hope, Simonsig, that the South
                    Africans always tried to hold out as a carrot for better relations, you know,
                    “we've got this great strategic site right on the tip of Africa and wouldn't it
                    be a good place for you to be using to track Russian submarines and control the
                    passage between the two oceans,” or whatever. So it was attractive to the
                    American military, especially in the Cold War context, but we did not use
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the military attach�s sort of fell into
                        the... I mean, they were dealing with a white-run military. Did they feel
                        comfortable with that? How did they see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>EICHER: Some of my best friends at the embassy were a couple of assistant
                    attach�s because they were the ones I had taken Afrikaans language with. We got
                    very close to them and close to their families. And, of course, they disapproved
                    of apartheid. But the military generally, I think, tended to be on the more
                    conservative side, as it always tends to be everywhere. I thought they were a
                    bit too friendly towards the government, a bit too understanding of the problems
                    faced by the white South Africans, and they probably thought I was unreasonable
                    in my harder line views about South Africans. But it was all in a friendly way.
                    I remember that there were a number of people at the embassy who I was seriously
                    irritated with because they seemed so supportive of the South African government
                    and its policies, but this didn't include the military attach�s I was close
                    to.</p>
                <p>Curiously, a couple of the military attach�s who were there with me were PNG'd
                    (asked to leave the country as persona non grata) after I left. This wasn't
                    aimed at them personally. It happened at a low point in U.S.-South African
                    relations. I can't remember what might have brought it on or what the U.S. might
                    have said or done to provoke the South Africans, but the South Africans took the
                    occasion to look at the attach� plane more carefully and find that to their
                    supposed surprise and horror that there was actually a camera on the plane and
                    that these guys were taking pictures as they flew around. Can you imagine such a
                    thing? What a discovery this must have been. So, they threw a couple of them out
                    of the country, including one of my good friends. This always struck us as, you
                    know, to some extent biting their nose to spite their face. Generally, the
                    military attach�s were among the people who were most sympathetic or
                    understanding of the government within the embassy. It was also a bit ironic
                    since for any of us young political officers, it would have been a badge of
                    honor to be PNG'ed from South Africa. Instead, they did it to a military
                    attach�, the last person we would have expected.</p>

                        Sullivan Principles? Were they, was that, something that was going on? If it
                        was, could you explain what they are and how you saw them at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was indeed going on. The Sullivan Principles were a set of standards,
                    ideas, practices, that U.S. companies which were in South Africa could
                    voluntarily agree to adhere to. They included fair labor practices and
                    non-discrimination. I can't remember exactly what the specific provisions were
                    but they covered things like collective bargaining, suitable housing for
                    workers, maybe even radical concepts like equal pay for equal work, and those
                    kinds of things. There was a big issue at the time as to whether U.S. companies
                    ought to be investing in South Africa or withdrawing from South Africa. The
                    Sullivan Principles, although a private initiative, were endorsed quite strongly
                    by the U.S. government. I can't remember whether that would have been Ford or
                    Carter or whether there was a change between the administrations. The Principles
                    were seen as a way in which Americans could continue to invest in South Africa
                    and have their companies there but still set an example for the South Africans
                    and be a positive influence and show that things could change positively as a
                    result of foreign investment. The principles were inspired by the Reverend Leon
                    Sullivan and had no official status but they played a very big part in the
                    debate about investment or disinvestment and what Americans should or should not
                    be doing. So, the idea was basically to have as many companies as possible sign
                    up to the Sullivan Principles and commit themselves to good practices. In the
                    bluntest terms, companies committed to the Principles were seen as “good guys”
                    who would have positive influence on South Africa and those which didn't sign up
                    to the Sullivan Principles were part of the problem, complicit in the apartheid
                    system. Separately, of course, a lot of people in the States thought there
                    should be no investment in South African at all, but at that stage it seemed
                    very unlikely that the big companies would disinvest, so the Sullivan Principles
                    were at least a positive step in encouraging the companies that were there to
                    adopt better practices. I think it actually worked to a certain extent. On the
                    other hand, the opponents would say that it just gave cover to the American
                    companies which were working there; they could say they were helping to improve
                    things, so it reduced the pressure to pull out completely, which the more
                    vociferous opponents of South Africa advocated.</p>

                        community, but what were you getting from the American business community
                        and the business community in general; what were you getting and how are
                        they seeing things? What was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>EICHER: This was still in the relatively early years of the anti-apartheid
                    movement and the private Americans in South Africa tended to be very much
                    pro-government, very sympathetic to the government. It was the rare American
                    businessman or American tourist who would express serious concern about what was
                    going on with the political or racial situation. There was a very high level of
                    understanding for or sympathy with the government from among the foreign
                    business community and even among many at the embassy. This was a continuing
                    irritation to us “young Turks” in the political section, the complacency with
                    which even many official Americans saw the whole situation in South Africa. They
                    would tell us that “yes, of course, it's a problem but you've got to understand
                    their situation” and “yes, of course, but what do you expect them to do?” and
                    “you can't really expect them to turn over the government to these folks,” and
                    “look at the history of it.” You know, we'd get exactly the same sorts of
                    arguments from these Americans as we did from the South Africans, which to us
                    showed that these unofficial Americans and a lot of official Americans seemed to
                    swallow the South African arguments hook, line and sinker.</p>

                        was not a very promising picture there. There were coups, tremendous
                        corruption. And you think back to find an African run nation that you could
                        pull up as a model.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was hard to do that. In fact, I think the only two functioning
                    democracies in Africa at the time were Botswana and Gambia. You know, it seemed
                    to me and to the other young officers in the political section to be just such a
                    clear issue of right and wronblack and white, if you wiland oppression and so
                    forth that we were frustrated there was so much policy disagreement over it. It
                    was just wrong, and so why couldn't people see it was wrong and do something
                    about it? Maybe we young and we weren't prudent enough. I was just 26 when we
                    got to South Africa. Maybe it was good that I had the ambassador and DCM to calm
                    down my “purple prose,” as they used to call it when they edited the language in
                    my drafts. I remember several times being told not to use such “purple prose” in
                    my reporting. But, you know, from our point of view it didn't matter what was
                    happening elsewhere in Africa. South Africa was richer and more developed; it
                    should be able to find a better way to deal with its problems. South Africa
                    should find a way to do what it ought to do. That was really all there was to
                    it. We were following events in South Africa, not the rest of Africa, that was
                    what we cared about and what was going on there was just so wrong. And, with
                    this conviction, we thought that then U.S. policy was also wrong, or at least
                    not strong enough. This was during a time when, in the rest of the world, the
                    U.S. was still supporting dictators here and there. We had just lost in Vietnam
                    as a result of ill-conceived policy and it was clear to us that in South Africa
                    we risked again being on the wrong side of history. We were starting to move in
                    the right direction. We had said “one man, one vote.” We were advocating things
                    like the Sullivan Principles. But we weren't pushing things as far and as fast
                    as I and some of the others, a few of the others, there thought we should.</p>

                        was U.S. policy coming from? How much thought was given to what the white
                        South Africans wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was still too junior to know what policy machinations might be coming
                    out of Washington. I spent enough time with Afrikaners that I realized that a
                    clear U.S. policy of “one man, one vote” would alienate them to such an extent
                    that U.S. influence with the government would be seriously diminished. In fact,
                    one of the emerging public debates on the whole South African question at the
                    time was whether we should wash our hands of the situation and go homactually
                    close down or restrict relationor whether we could do more good by staying and
                    trying to have a positive influence on the ground. There was even a name for the
                    first option; it was sometimes called the “Pontius Pilate option,” washing your
                    hands and going home, rather than being associated with a regime that was so bad
                    and that was so unwilling to make reasonable changes to its policies. It never
                    got to the point that official Americans seriously thought we should just
                    completely pack it in, although that was certainly advocated in some academic
                    circles and by most countries at the United Nations. But we did, at least some
                    of us did, believe U.S. policy should get increasingly tough and we should
                    ratchet down U.S. relations quite substantially if they did not improve their
                    policies. I remember being elated when Mondale said “one man, one vote;”
                    symbolically it finally put us clearly on the right side of the biggest
                    political issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I don't recall having any contact with the Israelis in South Africa but
                    there was one major incident involving them. I think I mentioned already that
                    the Israelis were involved in arms cooperation with the South Africans and, in
                    fact, there was quite a large and influential Jewish community in South Africa.
                    While I was there, there was an atomic blast off the Atlantic coast of South
                    Africa, which caught everybody by surprise, as far as I can tell. I think the
                    embassy was really, seriously caught by surprise. I remember being in a meeting
                    with the ambassador where he certainly gave every impression of not having known
                    this was going to happen and wondering what was going on. One of the questions
                    raised was whether it was a South African nuclear blast that they organized all
                    on their own or to what extent cooperation with the Israelis might have been
                    involved and if it might have been a joint project.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one suspects that they're doing their job. They're
                        out trying to find out whether the South Africans were working on nuclear
                        developments.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>EICHER: The South Africans, of course, denied everything, even that there was a
                    blast. But, I guess there were satellite pictures and maybe windborne radiation
                    or whatever, but it was a big issue and it was pretty clear to us that there had
                    been a nuclear blast that was off the coast of South Africa. No question that
                    South Africans were involved and the remaining question was to what extent
                    Israel was involved. There seemed to be a sense that there was certainly some
                    Israeli involvement, a surmise, I should say, because I never personally saw any
                    evidence of whether it was a joint effort or to what extent they may have just
                    helped South Africa with the technology. That just was not clear at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there were a couple of other things you
                        wanted to talk about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: One of the most interesting meetings which I just wanted to mention was
                    with Steve Biko, himself, when I was there. He was banned at the time, meaning
                    he was restricted to his hometown in the Eastern Cape. But, a couple of us from
                    the embassy, myself and another political officer, Steve McDonald, went down and
                    spent a day with Biko in East London, where he lived. I wish I could remember
                    more of the specific conversation. I know we wrote it up in great detail and
                    once I tried to get it under the Freedom of Information Act and failed, but I
                    suspect I could probably get it now. I remember him being an extremely
                    articulate, impressive young leader. While we were in East London, we played
                    sort of hide and seek with a team of South African security police who were
                    assigned to follow him everyplace he went. Part of his banning order allowed him
                    to meet with only one outsider at a time but he was happy to stretch that and
                    meet with two of us and the security team didn't interfere. He took us from
                    place to place by back roads, trying to lose this team of security agents behind
                    him, who always eventually found us again. He introduced us to a lot of other
                    very impressive people in that neighborhood who later on became leaders of the
                    anti-apartheid movement. Biko was later arrested and killed in prison. I did
                    attend his funeral, as did the ambassador and Richard Baltimore, the other young
                    political officer, and Steve McDonald, since Steve and I were the two who
                    actually knew him.</p>
                <p>There was even an amusing little article in the South African press. The
                    ambassador was there in his limousine with the American flag flying and for some
                    reason they were having trouble with the flag and couldn't get it to stay up on
                    its little fender flagpole. So, the newspapers reported that the ambassador was
                    there with his flag flying at half mast for Steve Biko.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Biko's death was one of the things that helped sort of catalyze international
                    opinion a little bit more on how badly things were going in South Africa. He
                    became very well known internationally after his death. I remember a couple of
                    my Nationalist Party parliamentary friends being very upset by this and saying,
                    “You know, who is this guy Biko? Nobody ever even heard of him and now you're
                    making such a big international furor over him.” I pointed out to them that here
                    I was a foreigner in South Africa and I knew him and had heard so much about him
                    that I traveled a thousand miles to East London just to spend a day with him. So
                    how come they had never heard of him? That just showed how out of touch with
                    their own country they were. I don't know whether my arguments had any influence
                    or not, but it seemed to give them pause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the relevance of Biko and how did he come to your
                        attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: He was one of the main brains behind the so-called Black Consciousness
                    Movement, the whole intellectuaand later physicauprising of the young generation
                    of black South Africans that we've been talking about. It was sort of the South
                    African equivalent, perhaps, of the “black is beautiful” movement in the United
                    States but with a very strong political cast to it. He and a few of the others
                    were the intellectual spirit behind the emergence of this.</p>
                <p>The other big issue I was going to mention was Namibia. This was something I
                    spent a lot of time on because it became my other portfolio, along with black
                    politics and parliament. In fact, Namibia was a place which was generally off
                    limits to official Americans because of its disputed status. It was still
                    controlled by South Africa, as it had been since World War I, under a mandate
                    from the League of Nations. The United Nations inherited the League of Nations
                    mandate, but the South Africans didn't accept that. So, technically, there was
                    an illegal regime occupying Namibistill called South West Africa by the South
                    Africanand as a result there were strict limits on which official Americans
                    could go to Namibia. In practice, there were only two of us, the political
                    counselor and myself, who were allowed to visit Namibia. This was one of several
                    travel restrictions binding on embassy people at the time; I've already
                    mentioned that we couldn't travel to Rhodesia or to the “independent”
                    homelands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the political counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The first year I was there it was Bob Munn and the second year it was Jay
                    Taylor.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>I ended up taking a lot of trips to Namibia, which were basically political
                    reporting trips, getting information from politicians and others there and
                    reporting back on what was going on. There were quite a lot of interesting
                    political developments going on in regard to Namibia. In the UN there was an
                    effort underway, particularly during the Carter administration, to try to find a
                    solution that would lead to the Namibian independence. Don McHenry was one of
                    our UN ambassadors and he was leading the Namibia negotiations. In New York they
                    had formed “the Contact Group,” made up of the five western members of the
                    Security Council, and this group was negotiating with the South Africans. So it
                    was a big international issue outside of Namibia and I was in the lucky position
                    of being one of just two official Americans who could actually go into Namibia
                    regularly and report on what was going on there. It was exciting because, you
                    know, despite being a 26 year old youngster, I got to meet all the big political
                    figures in Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe Namibia and what was going on when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Namibia was actually still called South West Africa, officially. The name
                    Namibia was still emerging and was starting to be used by the blacks but
                    certainly not by the white South Africans. The South Africans did accept that
                    Namibia was a trust territory, not part of South Africa, even though they didn't
                    accept that the UN had any jurisdiction there. By the time I arrived in South
                    Africa in 1976, they had finally accepted in principle that it should become
                    independent. They had started a process called the Turnhalle Conference under
                    which Namibia would become independent. The Turnhalle was the name of a
                    conference hall in Windhoek where the meetings to discuss independence were
                    held. In good South African style, the independence plan was based on ethnic
                    groups. So, at the Turnhalle there were representatives of the whites and the
                    Hereros and the Ovambos and so forth, all according to their ethnic affiliation.
                    They were trying to come to some agreement on how Namibia would become
                    independent, a little bit along the lines of what was happening with the
                    homelands in South Africa, but not nearly as severe. The South Africans had even
                    succeed in luring back to Namibia a few liberation movement leaders who were
                    involved in the conference and lent it a bit of a veneer of respectability. The
                    major liberation movement, SWAPO (the South West Africa People's Organization),
                    would have nothing to do with the conference, of course. The Turnhalle process
                    was going forward completely separately from the UN negotiating process, which
                    was trying to bring real, internationally recognized independence to Namibia.
                    The South Africans used the Turnhalle to some extent as a pressure point against
                    the UN and the outside world. When the negotiations got too difficult at the UN
                    they would say “well, we don't need to agree to that; we've got our own
                    independence process going on and we'll just proceed with it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>The UN had adopted Security Council Resolution 385, which more or less condemned
                    the South African-backed process and insisted on elections under UN supervision
                    and control. The Contact Group, led by McHenry and others, was moving forward to
                    try to make some actual progress in bridging the differences between South
                    Africa and the UN, so that resolution 385 could actually be implemented. To do
                    this, they needed to negotiate with the South Africans, which they actually
                    started doing. McHenry came out a couple of times; I thought he was quite
                    impressive. It was also nice to have the South Africans negotiating with a black
                    American, which I think made them a bit uncomfortable. The internal procesthe
                    Turnhalle proceswas not really relevant to the bigger picture except that it
                    provided a real impetus for negotiations to find a solution before there was a
                    unilateral declaration of independence, as there had been in Rhodesia, which
                    would make it even harder to get an internationally recognized solution. And, of
                    course, all the internal leaders took themselves seriously as needing to be
                    consulted by the South Africans on the UN negotiations. In fact, the Turnhalle
                    process was ongoing, so it was always out there as a threat to the UN
                    negotiations and as a fall-back position for South Africa if the UN process
                    should fail.</p>
                <p>On my trips to Namibia, I would meet with all of the different internal parties,
                    including SWAPO, the main black party. That's an interesting footnote: SWAPO had
                    an internal branch in Namibia that was actually legal and operating openly as a
                    political party, although it was boycotting the Turnhalle conference. It was
                    headed by a young guy named Daniel Tjongarero, who I got to know pretty well. He
                    later became a minister in the post-independence government, I think. The main
                    white party was headed by a guy named Dirk Mudge. And, as I said, there were
                    some former Namibian exiles, former SWAPO people and others, that had been lured
                    back to take part in the Turnhalle, so the South Africans got some good
                    propaganda value out of that.</p>
                <p>The whole situation was really interesting and sometimes exciting. As the UN
                    negotiations progressed, the five embassies in South Africa formed their own
                    branch of the “Contact Group” and became involved in the day to day
                    negotiations. There was some real progress in the talkor what seemed like
                    progress. Shortly after I moved on to my next assignment, the UN adopted the
                    next big resolution on Namibia, 435, which eventually formed the basis for
                    Namibian independence, after many more years of negotiation. So, I felt a
                    certain pride in having been involved in that, even in a small way. We thought
                    we were closer to independence than we really were. I remember even that I wrote
                    to my assignments officer in Washington and asked to be assigned to Windhoek
                    next if the negotiations succeeded and we opened an embassy there.</p>
                <p>As for Windhoek itself, it was just a very quiet, a very pleasant place. The
                    atmosphere was not nearly as oppressive as it was in South Africa. You could
                    feel the difference when you got there. Even though there was lots of racial
                    segregation, it was not the same kind of apartheid that you had in South Africa
                    proper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much going on there or in other parts of the
                        country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, at that time I never got out of Windhoek. In a later phase of my
                    career, I went back and helped set up the first U.S. mission in Namibia; that
                    was in 1984. Back in 1976-1978, I was flying in and out of Windhoek directly
                    from Cape Town or Johannesburg. I stayed at the only big, nice hotel in town,
                    the Kalahari Sands. I'd stay a few days, make the rounds of political meetings
                    with journalists, political leaders, and others who might be influential, and
                    then return to Cape Town or Pretoria, wherever I was flying out of. As I said,
                    Windhoek was kind of a small town. It was very isolated, very pretty, very dry,
                    and they spoke a lot of Afrikaans. In fact, I found I used my Afrikaans on the
                    street more in Namibia than I did in South Africa. There was still a lot of
                    German influence and a lot of ethnic Germans, left over from when it had been a
                    German colony before World War I. There was even a German consul, the only
                    foreign representative in Namibia, which they maintained because there were
                    still a lot of German citizens. I remember that one of my best contacts was the
                    editor of the German newspaper published in Windhoek.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the people? Was this all black or was this a
                        mixture or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I don't remember the proportions but it was similar to South Africa,
                    although without the same level of “coloreds” and Indians. Among the whites, as
                    I said, there was still a leftover German community, and there were more
                    Afrikaners than English.</p>
                <p>Although the South Africans had broken the negotiating structure of the Turnhalle
                    into ethnic groups, you didn't feel the racial divide quite the way you did in
                    South Africa. There didn't seem to be any kind of real Herero or Ovambo
                    political movement, like the Zulu movement in South Africa, which really had any
                    political influence on its own. It was just clearly a game the South Africans
                    were playing. There was a chance that it would work, as long as the South
                    African umbrella stayed over it. I mean “work” in the sense that they might have
                    been able to take Namibia to a so-called independence that nobody would
                    recognize, but that might continue to function for a long time, sort of along
                    the Rhodesian model. That was the real threat to the UN process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reflection of the war in Angola when you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>EICHER: There was. I mean, not so much in Windhoek as on the border. In Namibia,
                    the South Africans had the military situation well in hand. There was, as I
                    mentioned, this very curious situation where you had SWAPO, which was the main
                    liberation movement, actually having offices, legally, inside the country.
                    SWAPO, of course, rejected the whole South African Turnhalle process and they
                    had people in the field based in Angola who were actually fighting a liberation
                    war. That is, they were trying to fight a liberation war; it was an extremely
                    unsuccessful liberation war. There were some places up in the far north where a
                    certain number of insurgents would come across the border from Angola at a
                    certain season of the year but they never got very far militarily, although they
                    had a lot of popular support and sympathy. The South African military had it
                    well in hand, and would follow them back well into Angola if necessary. In
                    Angola it was kind of a mess as well, of course. They had recently become
                    independent and had a civil war going on. Savimbi and his people were operating
                    in the south of Angola with South African support at the same time that SWAPO
                    was trying to use the same areas to come into Namibia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find living in South Africa, being an American
                        diplomat, did you find a heavy hand of security around you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I did not, directly. But I think I've mentioned that many of my black
                    friends were questioned by security about their contacts with the embassy. It
                    was also my first experience in having my telephone tapped, which I believe it
                    was. And, of course the whole South African security situation was so repressive
                    that it was constantly depressing for us. So, I didn't feel a heavy hand in the
                    sense that I thought anyone was following me around or that I was in any danger,
                    but certainly there was a heavy hand of security around me in the general sense
                    that there was one all over the country.</p>

                    was Nigeria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Nigeria from when to when?</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>EICHER: I felt alright about it at the time. I had been interested in African
                    affairs. That's what took me to South Africa and I was looking for another
                    African assignment. I can't remember exactly what our first choice was but
                    Nigeria was not one of the countries on our list. We wanted to go to Kenya or to
                    GhanAccra might have been our first choicand when those didn't work we finally
                    got word that we were going to Nigeria, which, little did we know, was not quite
                    the same thing. We thought that West Africa was West Africa, but Nigeria turned
                    out to bfrom a living point of viequite an unpleasant place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you at the time feel that you were, did you feel like
                        an Africanist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, kind of, I mean, to the extent you can be an Africanist after one
                    tour. But out of my two tours in the Foreign Service, one was in Africa. I had
                    also done a lot of work on Africa at university, since I was interested in it. I
                    was looking forward to another African tour and I guess I was slowly becoming an
                    Africanist and would go on to a couple of African tours after that as well. So
                    Africa did interest me. I was still in the mode of wanting to go to unusual
                    places that I hadn't been to before and the politics of Africa were certainly
                    very interesting. It struck me that Africa was kind of a neglected element of
                    U.S. foreign policy, so it was something that as a junior officer you could get
                    your teeth into, and do more interesting things and go more interesting places
                    than you might if you were assigned to one of the big European embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1978 what was the situation in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It turned out to be an interesting two years politically. I was assigned
                    as a political officer again, which, you'll recall was my “cone.” In Nigeria at
                    the time was there was a military government led by General Obasanjo.
                    Interestingly, that's the same Obasanjo who was president of Nigeria again until
                    a couple of weeks ago. When I was in Nigeria, Obasanjo had launched a process to
                    take Nigeria back to civilian rule after many years of military government. This
                    was kind of revolutionary in Africa at the time; military governments just
                    didn't hand power back to civilians. So Obasanjo was an unusual leader in that
                    regards and was doing something very good in terms of moving toward a new
                    constitution and elections. The new constitution was based on the American
                    model. He divided the country into 19 states and set up a constitution which was
                    similar to ours. About halfway through my tour in Nigeria they had the elections
                    and successfully returned to civilian rule. Shehu Shagari was elected president
                    of Nigeria and Obasanjo, to his credit, went back to the barracks. This was a
                    big event. There have been a lot of coups in Africa and a lot of post-colonial
                    undemocratic regimes. But what you had in Nigeria at the time was the biggest,
                    most important country in black Africa going back to civilian rule, and on the
                    American model, to boot. So it made a very interesting time to be a young
                    political officer in Nigeria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the embassy, the ambassador, the
                        DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The ambassador when I got there for the first year was Don Easum. He was
                    replaced later on by Steve Low. The DCM was Parker somebody, I can't remember
                    his last name. Katherine Clark-Bourne was political counselor. There were about
                    four or five of us in the political section. It was a good-sized political
                    section, bigger than our political section in South Africa. When I got there, we
                    were in the old embassy, in downtown Lagos in an old building. It was not very
                    pleasant accommodations but there was a new embassy being built. Everybody was
                    looking forward to moving to the new building. We were so cramped that I had to
                    share an office with the other junior political officer, Bob Frasure, who later
                    went on to die in tragic circumstances in Bosnia during the war there. After a
                    few months, we moved to the new embassy building out on Victoria Island just off
                    the coast, which was much newer, nicer digs.</p>
                <p>Nigeria was a very tough place to operate. We didn't have working telephones
                    anyplace in Lagos, including in the Embassy. We didn't even have a telephone
                    instrument in our home. Even where there were telephones, you could virtually
                    never get a call through. Traffic was absolutely horrendous and moved at a
                    crawl. So it became very difficult to get around and do your job as a political
                    officer, especially in comparison to my previous post in South Africa. If you
                    wanted to meet with anybody or even talk with someone, you had to get in an
                    embassy car and laboriously make your way to their office, maybe an hour to get
                    downtown, or twice that long to get to the university, and hope they were there
                    when you arrived and hope they had time to see you. Then, you would crawl back
                    to the embassy in traffic afterwards. So it was very difficult and often
                    frustrating. You wasted an awful lot of time. Often you got somewhere and the
                    person or people you wanted to see were not there; “he's not on seat,” they
                    would say; we got to hate that expression. When the ambassador wanted an
                    appointment with someone, he couldn't telephone, so he would send one of us down
                    in person to arrange the appointment for him. You couldn't even get a phone call
                    through to the Foreign Ministry. Going there and returning might be a whole
                    morning's work, just making one appointment for the ambassador. And I had to go
                    down to the Foreign Ministry a lot. I remember it was in a high-rise building
                    downtown and the elevator never worked. The ministry itself was on the sixth,
                    seventh and eighth floors so we would always be walking up that many floors to
                    get to the Ministry. Those of us who went to the ministry used to joke that
                    there should be a reciprocity agreementhat Nigerian diplomats in Washington
                    should be required to climb eight flights of stairs for their appointments at
                    the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think this was sort of an “amateur hour.” You
                        know, the damn place doesn't work and the people, the Nigerians... Oh, it's
                        just not working. I mean, it's not working how Americans like things to
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>EICHER: I have to admit there was a lot of that feeling around, both from the
                    expatriate community generally and from the people at the embassy. It did give
                    you kind of a negative view of the country because it was so difficult to do
                    anything. It was such a hard place to live. Nothing seemed to work, nothing was
                    available in the stores, there were terrible health problems, it was dirty and
                    run-down, and the population in the Lagos area tended to be extremely arrogant
                    and unfriendly and hard to deal with, as well. So there was kind of a mixed
                    feeling. On the one hand, it was an unpleasant place to be, but on the other,
                    you knew you were in Africa's most important country, with the biggest
                    population, biggest economy, most military power, and all that; all in all a
                    very vibrant society. You know, it was, in its way, very exciting. It always
                    seemed like there were things going on politically. They were moving toward
                    general elections and every day there were new political parties being formed
                    and speeches and rallies and one thing and another, so professionally, being
                    able to follow all this and to have so much going on seemed very interesting.
                    But physically, it was extremely difficult. Crime was also very bad. Each of the
                    embassy residences had its own guards. Housing was very bad. The power went off
                    all the time. The weather was hot and sticky. It was just a very unpleasant
                    place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what did you ascribe, you and you colleagues ascribe
                        the fact that things didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I'm not sure that we thought very much why things were not working. To me
                    it was my first experience in West Africa. It seemed that this must just be the
                    way that it is. You know, partly the colonial powers left it a wreck, partly
                    there was internal corruption which was making it a wreck, partly they just
                    didn't have the skills and education that they needed; partly they weren't
                    managing it as well as they could. I don't know. There was an expression
                    “wa-wa,” “West Africa wins again.” Every time something went wrong you just sort
                    of took it in stride. You'd roll your eyes knowingly and come to expect that, of
                    course, if something can go wrong, it's going to go wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you had three children.</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>EICHER: That is true, indeed. She certainly was not very happy living in Nigeria.
                    On the one hand, because it was such a tough place and because the embassy
                    people all lived more or less in the same general neighborhood of town, we made
                    a lot of quite good friends and there was a lot of esprit de corps. There were a
                    lot of young families, a lot of kids the same age as ours, a quite reasonable
                    American school, with a lot of young teachers who we got to be friends with. The
                    ambassador opened the residence grounds with its swimming pool to the embassy
                    community almost all the time on a permanent basis. There was a commissary where
                    you could get things, fortunately, because very little was available on the
                    local market. There were food orders. You'd have to order frozen food every
                    three months and they gave you two extra freezers to keep it in. Since power
                    went out all the time, your many-months supply of food was always in danger of
                    thawing out and spoiling. When we first got there, there were no generators at
                    the houses, you just lived with the power outages. Eventually, they installed
                    generators that you could run for a few hours at a time when the power went out.
                    The generators made so much noise, however, that the neighbors were always
                    complaining.</p>
                <p>So, my wife, to get back to your question, really didn't like it at all. The kids
                    tended to be sick fairly oftenot to mention her and me, as welfrom one thing or
                    another, you know, eating this or getting that infected, or whatever it might
                    be. We were able to have household help as we had in South Africa, so we had
                    somebody to look after the kids when she wasn't there. It gave her some freedom
                    and she did work part-time at the embassy on and off, for the Foreign Building
                    Office, which was building the new embassy and for the regional security
                    officer, among others. So, she got by.</p>
                <p>But, life was generally not pleasant. Housing was sub-standard in comparison to
                    embassy housing elsewhere. The place we were in had rats running in the yard
                    when we first got there, before we had it cleaned up. The roof was in such bad
                    shape that twice we had upstairs rooms flooded after heavy rains. We had an
                    electrical fire because the wiring was bad. Crime was very bad, so much so that
                    at night we were supposed to lock ourselves into the upstairs of our house,
                    which was all barred off at the top of the stairs like a jail. We had guards at
                    the house, two young, unarmed Nigerians, one was the day guard and one the night
                    guard. On a trip back to the States, we bought them each a pair of blue jeans,
                    which became one of their prized possessions. One night, the night guard had his
                    stolen. We asked how it happened and he explained that he took them off and hung
                    them on the line before he lay down to go to sleep and they were gone when he
                    woke up. This was the guy who was supposed to be up guarding us at night! When
                    we got to Nigeria, there were still public executions of criminals; the
                    Nigerians would execute prisoners by tying them to a pole on the public beach
                    and shooting them. Some of the Embassy Marines would go down to watch. The
                    practice was ended before we left.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Lagos did have pretty beaches, but we seldom went. The currents were so dangerous
                    along the West African coast that you weren't supposed to swim; many people used
                    to drown. In fact, once we were at the beach and there was a dead body washed
                    up. All the kids wanted to go down and look at it and we had to restrain them.
                    And, you would be constantly hassled at the beach, both by vendors trying to
                    sell handicrafts and things, and just by onlookers, some of whom, shall I say,
                    weren't polite. To get away to the beach, we would occasionally drive to Lome,
                    in Togo, two countries away but only a four hour drive; we'd convoy with a
                    couple other embassy families. Lome had a very nice resort hotels, and good
                    French food, and was just a pleasant place to get away from Lagos.</p>
                <p>We also had another moving disaster going to Nigeria: our shipment of household
                    effects was stolen off the docks and never reached us. What a disaster that was!
                    There we were with three little kids in a country where you couldn't get
                    anything, with our household effects lost. There certainly was no thought in any
                    of our minds that we were going to extend in Nigeria after two years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was fun?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was good fun. We did try to get out, we tried to meet politicians, and
                    we tried to get around the country. In fact, there was an effort, to the credit
                    of the embassy management, to try to get us out quite a bit to travel in
                    Nigeria, which was quite difficult and took a lot of planning. We'd have to get
                    a big embassy vehicle, usually one of these giant “carry-alls,” as they used to
                    call SUVs; they weren't called SUVs yet at that time. You'd have to load up the
                    vehicle with C-rations because you couldn't be certain food would be available
                    anyplace you went. The hotel accommodations, if they existed, could be
                    unbelievably bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I ended up taking a few of these different excursions, which were extremely
                    interesting and really did get you out into what I considered to be the wilds of
                    Africa. I remember my first one, which was very soon after getting to Nigeria,
                    which was a trip up to the north. I went up and joined the consul general in
                    Kaduna, it was Joe Lake at the time, and had quite a trip out to eastern
                    Nigeria, to Maiduguri, to meet some politicians and check out the situation
                    there. That was very interesting. We decided we would drive up to see Lake Chad
                    because this sounded to both of us like a very interesting thing to do. We ended
                    up driving on some endless, very bad dirt roads through very wild country, just
                    driving and driving and driving. It seemed to never end. We sort of compared
                    ourselves mentally to Livingston trekking endlessly through the wilds of Africa.
                    No matter how far we wenhourwe couldn't find the lake; again, it was like
                    Livingston not being able to find the source of the Nile. We were asking people
                    and they were saying “well, it's right here,” sort of like, “open your eyes,
                    stupid” but we couldn't see any water. We never actually saw a lake. Apparently,
                    at that season the lake dried up in the area we were in. You could see all
                    around you sort of a flat plain full of reeds that you wouldn't know was a lake
                    unless somebody told you it was. So, in a sense, we were in the lake, in the
                    lake bed, at least. We finally decided, we told each other, we could honestly
                    say we had been “to the shores of Lake Chad,” even if we couldn't say we had
                    seen Lake Chad.</p>
                <p>While I was away on that triwhich, as I said, was very soon after arriving in
                    Lagothe upstairs of our house flooded during a storm. The roof was bad; that was
                    the first of several floods we had. It was late at night and my wife was home
                    alone with the kids; we had no telephone; and we barely knew anyone yet. She had
                    to run down the street to a neighbor's in the middle of the night and ask them
                    to radio the GSO (the general services office) to come help bail her out,
                    literally. She still hasn't forgiven me for that one.</p>
                <p>Another trip I took with a couple of people through the eastern delta region of
                    Nigeria, which was very interestinPort Harcourt and Calabar and the whole
                    southeast area of Nigeria, the area that had once seceded from Nigeria as
                    Biafra. In addition to meeting with politicians and other local leaders, I
                    remember going to meetings at the University of Calabar and then proudly buying
                    a University of Calabar T-shirt in their bookstore, which I thought was fun to
                    wear around because it was so exotic. We also visited the oil companies who were
                    out there and I remember being helicoptered out to one of their oil platforms
                    off the coast to get a look at that. It wasn't really part of my portfolio, but
                    one of the guys I was traveling with was an economic officer so we did both
                    political and economic meetings, since we were traveling together. That was my
                    first ever helicopter ride, as well is my first time on an oil platform, so that
                    was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any residue of the Biafran War when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>EICHER: Not a lot. I mean, people talked about it still, of course, and everybody
                    had been through it so it was very much part of recent history. Our housekeeper
                    was an Ibo who had lost her husband and children and home during the war. I
                    guess it had been less than ten years since the war took place, so it was still
                    very much part of the background people were living with. On this trip to the
                    east that I'm talking about, we drove through much of what used to be Biafra,
                    but you really couldn't see real devastation there and didn't get the feeling
                    that there had recently been a war there. There were maybe just a few ruined
                    buildings or wrecks that were left over from the war. The Ibowho had been the
                    secessionistwere still quite a force in Nigerian politics, which generally
                    tended to break down along ethnic lines. There were a lot of different divisions
                    in the country, the largest one being the North-South division, to some extent
                    this mirrored a Muslim-Christian division, although that's a simplification and
                    is not entirely accurate. And, in the southern Nigeria, you also had an
                    east-west division between the Yorubas and the Ibos, who were the two largest
                    groups, but there were lots and lots of other ethnic groups scattered around
                    there as well. So it would be very simplistic to try to divide it into
                    threYoruba, Ibo and northern Hausa-Fulanalthough that was the sort of the
                    standard way people would describe the country's ethnic divisions in their
                    briefings to visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the military having a hand in the elections as
                        far as favorites or support or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We didn't really. It seemed at the time to be a quite reasonably run
                    contest. The military, after all, was anxious to return to civilian rule and
                    didn't want trouble. Obasanjo was trying to get rid of power, not hold on to it.
                    But, this is a very interesting question to me now because I have spent much of
                    the last 10 years heading election observation missions. I try to think back
                    sometimes about what I really knew about elections at that point in my life, and
                    whether when I and others at the embassy who were following the elections we
                    were looking for the right things. I'm not sure anymore that we were. I don't
                    doubt that there must have been a lot of manipulations that went along with the
                    elections. But that was not the impression we had at the time and it was
                    certainly a lively campaign, and there didn't seem to be any serious
                    restrictions on freedom of speech or freedom of assembly.</p>
                <p>There were lots of candidates. There was even one rather amusing candidate,
                    Nigeria's biggest pop star, a fellow named Fela, who had been involved in
                    protest movements in the past. He decided he wanted to run for president. One of
                    the requirements of running for president was that a candidate had to have a
                    campaign establishment in all 19 of Nigeria's states. This was a rule because
                    they wanted to avoid the kind of regional politics that had led to the Biafra
                    war, so every party was required to be a nation-wide party; there could be no
                    regional parties. So Fela's solution to this was to have a big ceremony and
                    marry 19 wives in one day, one from each of the 19 states! Through their family
                    connections, presto, he had a campaign establishment in each one of the 19
                    states. So that was kind of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not very well, as I recall. He was never really considered a serious
                    contender, although he got a lot of publicity. He had his 19 wives support him,
                    I guess, and maybe a bunch of fans. There was no limit on the number of wives a
                    man could have in Nigeria, if he could support them. In fact, men weren't even
                    necessarily expected to support all of their wives; it was not uncommon for each
                    wife to be expected to support herself and her children.</p>
                <p>But the real presidential contest, if I recall correctly, was between Shagari,
                    who was the main northern candidate and had a young Ibo for his vice
                    presidential running mate, Alex Ekwueme, against an old-time politician named
                    Awolowo. Awolowo was a Yoruba and drew most of his support from the Yoruba areas
                    of southwest Nigeria. He was well known as one of the leaders of Nigeria's
                    independence era. As I recall, Shagari pretty much trounced him. They were the
                    only two candidates who really figured in the contest. There were also lots of
                    state races and Senate races and other election contests going on at the same
                    time that I don't remember much about. But I do remember there was a lot going
                    on that we continually had to follow and that we did a lot of reporting. In
                    addition to election reporting, there was a lot of biographical reporting to do,
                    since a whole new set of leaders was emerging in Nigeria. I remember that the
                    Department even sent out an extra officer for several months, maybe even a year,
                    just to do biographical reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the Islamic influence in the
                        north? Did we see in this a certain amount of, you might say, intolerance
                        that might affect Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It wasn't really seen as an issue at the time at all. I don't recall it
                    in any of our reporting or any reporting from the consulate in Kaduna. Certainly
                    Islam was part of the political background to the country and we recognized that
                    there was an Islamic north and a more or less Christian south, which affected
                    people's political attitudes. But, Islamic radicalism was not something that had
                    emerged at all as an issue.</p>
                <p>There was a civil war going on in Chad at the time, which was a neighboring
                    country, and I know Nigeria got involved regularly in the efforts to find a
                    solution in Chad. They had a big conference in Lagos and, I remember the
                    political counselor asked a couple of us to go down and find out what was
                    happening at the Chad conference. There were no telephones, of course. We
                    couldn't call or make an appointment with anyone. So, we went down to the hotel
                    where they were holding the conference on Chad and started chatting up some
                    delegates in the lobby to see if we could find out what was going on. Pretty
                    soon a couple of security officers approached us and asked us what we were doing
                    and whether we had credentials and of course, we didn't, and so we were evicted
                    from the Chad conference.</p>

                        at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not that I can recall, although he was very active in the Chad conflict.
                    You know, Libyan activity in Nigeria would've been something that we probably
                    would have been concerned about at the time if it were happening, but I don't
                    remember that being a problem. Nigeria was an OPEC country, I believe. There was
                    certainly some oil politics in the bigger sense but that was not in my portfolio
                    so it was not something that I followed or recall particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left how did you find it? Was there a
                        pretty good political structure or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It seemed to be a pretty good structure. As I said, it was modeled after
                    ours and so it had to be close to perfect. (Chuckle.) You know, it looked like
                    they might actually make a go of it, which would have been wonderfuAfrica's
                    largest country moving successfully to democracy. As it happened, it didn't last
                    very long. But, it was still a functioning civilian democracy and something we
                    could be quite hopeful about at the time I left.</p>
                <p>I remember that soon after the new government took over, the civilian government,
                    we had a visit by a big congressional delegation, led by Jim Wright, the Speaker
                    of the House, and somehow I ended up as his control officer and it actually went
                    quite well. The new congressmen and senators in Nigeria were really pleased to
                    meet some of their American counterparts. The Americans actually visited the
                    newly-built Senate Hall and the House of Representatives or whatever they called
                    it in Nigeria, and they were all talking to each other about how you vote and
                    what buttons you press to vote electronically in each chamber. So, that was
                    actually a very happy CODEL (congressional delegation) and I remember being very
                    impressed with Jim Wright, as well.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of other visitors I should mention, as well. It seemed at times as
                    if the whole American black establishment felt like they needed to visit
                    Nigeria. I can't remember all of them. I don't remember if Jesse Jackson came
                    out or not; I think he may have. We had Tom Bradley from Los Angeles and Andy
                    Young and many others. My wife was asked to take care of Andy Young's son, who
                    was about the same age as our oldest son; I can't remember exactly how she got
                    stuck with that. The same day that he was coming over, we had one of those
                    typical Nigerian mess-ups where the sewer lines backed up into our kitchen and
                    we had a kitchen flooded with sewage to contend with. So she had a stressful
                    time of it, but it went well and everyone was grateful to her.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>One particular visit which I ended up as control officer on, which was my
                    all-time greatest control officership, was Muhammad Ali. He came to Lagos as an
                    official U.S. envoy to try to persuade African countries not to participate in
                    the Moscow Olympics. The U.S. was boycotting the Olympics because Russians had
                    invaded Afghanistan. Ali, being a good Muslim, was against the Russian invasion
                    of a Muslim country and someone had convinced him to sign on to this idea of
                    being an American envoy to the African states to get them to join the boycott.
                    Nigeria was one of four countries he was visiting. From a personal perspective,
                    I found this to be just a wonderful little visit, a great experience. Muhammad
                    Ali was one of the best-known Americans in the world, probably the best known
                    American. He played it up wonderfully. We had a bus, a small minibus, which we
                    took him and the delegation around in. He did a lot of his famous clowning. He
                    would hang out of the open door of the little bus as we went alongenerally
                    slowly through Lagos traffiand shake his fist at people on the street and
                    absolutely everybody knew him instantly on sight and regarded him as a hero.
                    Everywhere we went we would have women and children running after the bus waving
                    and shouting “Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Ali!”</p>
                <p>Interestingly though, in private he was very calm, very subdued, even meek. This
                    was so different from his public persona that it came as quite a shock. He would
                    carefully listen to the instructions that were given to him by Lannon Walker, a
                    deputy assistant secretary of state who had come out with him on the delegation
                    and would do as he was told carefully and very meekly. But, as soon as he got
                    out into a crowd, he was clowning and sparring with everybody making a good
                    impression in line with his image as “the greatest.” And, he hit on all the
                    women, what a womanizer! When there was a little gap in his schedule I asked if
                    he would go greet the kids at the American school and he agreed. I think that
                    was my wife's idea. Anyway, we got it organized. The school let all the kids out
                    of class and everybody crowded around him and got to see Muhammad Ali and shake
                    his hand. It was a great visit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes. From a substantive point of view, the visit was a flop, which was
                    fairly predictable. Nigeria attended the Moscow Olympics. They loved Muhammad
                    Ali but they didn't buy his message.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of either the black caucus or
                        political correctness or something? I mean, obviously, Nigeria was a black
                        African country and a lot of things weren't going very well.</hi>

                <p>EICHER: In the end, being in Nigeria really made clear the extent to which Africa
                    was a side issue of U.S. foreign policy. I mean, it's not as if we ever imagined
                    that Africa was at the center of things, but here we were in the most important,
                    largest, wealthiest, most powerful African country and I don't remember having a
                    feeling that Washington considered it to be important in the grand scheme of
                    things. In South Africa, I felt much more like we were in the center of issues
                    that people cared about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was assigned to African Area Studies so I went to UCLA for a year,
                    which was the academic year of 1980 to 1981. I always joke that after two tours
                    in Africa the State Department decided that it was time for me to learn
                    something about Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find UCLA for African studies and did it have
                        a specialty or an attitude or something you didn't find in the
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>EICHER: Let me start out by saying this was a wonderful program that the
                    Department used to havI'm not sure if it still existof sending people to do a
                    year of university area studies. The Department had somehow selected four
                    schools in the United States that they thought had the kind of African studies
                    programs they would like to send Foreign Service people to; just one or two
                    people a year were selected for the program. I had been accepted to do area
                    studies quite a while before the end of my tour in Lagos, but in the
                    Department's usual fashion, they never really explained to me how the mechanics
                    of the program worked. I was trying to get them to send me to London, where
                    other Foreign Service people had done African studies before, I think at the
                    University of London. It sounded like it would be good fun to do it there, but
                    training in London had been discontinued. They told me my arguments were so
                    persuasive that they were going to start it again for subsequent years but
                    couldn't do it for me. They gave me a choice of the universities of Indiana,
                    Michigan, Northwestern or UCLA, but didn't send me anything about any of the
                    programs at the different schools, and they said they needed my decision
                    immediately. I was still in Lagos and didn't have any information on which to
                    make a decision on the different programs. There was no Internet back then, of
                    course, and as I said, we didn't even have working telephones in Lagos. So,
                    strictly on the basis of geography, I decided with my family that we would
                    rather be in California than in the Midwest. In particular, my wife came from
                    Southern California and she had complained good-naturedly throughout my career
                    up to that point, “why don't we have an embassy in southern California so we can
                    go back there?” I had never lived in California, so it sounded good to me. And
                    it was a good choice. I'm not sure I would want to live there permanently and
                    she was also disappointed at how much southern California had changed since her
                    girlhood.</p>
                <p>UCLA is a great school with a very good, big African studies program. The State
                    Department's approach to the program was that they were not sending me to area
                    studies with the goal of getting a degree. If fact, they kind of discouraged the
                    idea of degrees. The goal was rather to get a very broad view of the continent
                    and to understand Africa a little better. We were encouraged, I was encouraged,
                    to take African art and African music, and other cultural subjects as well as
                    the history, political science, and economics that I might have been more
                    attracted to. So I took a little bit of each and I even audited a bunch of extra
                    courses. I took it quite seriously and worked hard, but it was nothing like
                    working a full-time job and I was able to do quite well. Actually, I did get a
                    degree as a result of a quirk: a UCLA master's degree, a Masters in African
                    Studies, required proficiency in an indigenous African language and the
                    university accepted my FSI 3/3 rating in Afrikaans as the indigenous African
                    language. So, already having the language, I didn't have to take quite a number
                    of courses that most of the other students had to struggle through. As a result,
                    I could complete all the requirements in one school year instead of two. The
                    UCLA program was multidisciplinary, so I could take a broad variety of
                    courseincluding African art and so forth as the State Department wanteand still
                    meet the requirements for a degree.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>All in all, I thought it was an enriching kind of experience. I had already spent
                    four years in Africa so I could put a lot of it in context. Perhaps the program
                    might have done me more good professionally if I had taken it before I went to
                    Africa rather than after I had served two tours there. The program was perhaps a
                    little too academic for a Foreign Service officer, maybe not as practical as I
                    thought it could be. I have one story that shows what I mean. My main “Politics
                    of East Africa” course was taught by a Marxist professor and the main question
                    that formed the basis of the course, the theme of the course, was whether the
                    bourgeoisie in Kenya was a “nationalist bourgeoisie” or a “comprador
                    bourgeoisie.” That is not exactly the kind of question we struggle with at the
                    State Department. But it was a fun year and an interesting year. And it was a
                    nice campus where you could sit under a jacaranda tree and enjoy your studies.
                    It was also a good way to get re-acclimatized to the U.S. again after three
                    tours abroad.</p>
                <p>But, it turned out to be a bit hard on the family to move somewhere for just one
                    year. We decided that would be the last time we'd do a one-year tour that
                    involved a move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the professors were plugged
                        in to Africa? I mean, were these people who talked about Africa, who had
                        spent time under the African sun or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They seemed to be quite plugged in. They had all spent a lot of time in
                    Africa, had done research in Africa and continued to do research in Africa.
                    There were some African professors there, along with Americans, so they were a
                    good group although, as I said, sometimes they specialized in issues which were
                    really not really relevant on a day-to-day basis, shall we say, to the kinds of
                    things that we were doing in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that, we're talking about 1981, are we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Back to the Department. Actually, to the Department for the first time,
                    except for my short training stints. I was not anxious to go to Washington. Even
                    after more than seven years in the Foreign Service, the Department still seemed
                    big and mysterious to me. I didn't know much about how it worked. I had joined
                    the Foreign Service to see the world, remember, not to become a Washington
                    bureaucrat. I somehow pictured work on the Department's geographic desks as
                    being very administrative; I didn't have a good understanding of how
                    policy-oriented it is. Once I actually served in Washington, I liked it very
                    much.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The African studies year was actually linked to a follow-on assignment in the
                    Department. They linked the assignments to make sure you would have at least one
                    assignment that would be relevant to your course work. So, I went on from UCLA
                    to my first Washington assignment, which was as the senior desk officer for
                    Liberia and Sierra Leone in the Office of West African Affairs in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone when
                        you took over the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Liberia turned out to be 99% of what I worked on. I had a deputy desk
                    officer who covered Sierra Leone under my general supervision, but even he spent
                    almost all his time on Liberia. There was far more to do on Liberia than Sierra
                    Leone because Liberia was “our” African countrthat is, of all the countries in
                    Africa, it was the only one that was generally regarded as primarily an American
                    responsibility. In the years I was on the desk, Liberia was also something of a
                    disaster, which required constant crisis management for us. There had been a
                    coup in Liberia just a year before I took over the desk. The long-time rulers,
                    the Americo-Liberians (who were descendants of freed American slaves who had
                    gone back or been sent back to Africa from the U.S. in the 1800s), were ousted
                    by a group of young, poorly educated, low-ranking soldiers from eastern Liberia.
                    The most prominent was Samuel Doe, a sergeant, who became head of state after
                    the coup, or the revolution, as they called it. During and after the coup, Doe
                    and his cohorts had murdered, or executed, a bunch of very good friends of the
                    United States who had previously been in power, lining them up on a beach in
                    front of a firing squad. There was a real fear at first that he was
                    anti-American and that he was toying with the Libyans and might fall under their
                    influence. People were afraid that we might “lose Liberia,” the African country
                    that was most identified with the U.S. and where we had a lot of investment and
                    facilities, as well as prestige, at stake. So, a policy decision taken even
                    before I arrived at the desk to try to “save” Liberia. To do this, we had to
                    recognize that our friends the Americo-Liberians were a political force of the
                    past. We would have to try to keep the country afloat economically and to
                    transform Samuel Doe into a responsible, respectable U.S.-leaning leader. I was
                    trying to follow the very early stages of this process from California while I
                    was at UCLA, and then I took it over when I arrived at the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everyone was still shocked by, I mean, I'm being awfully
                        facetious, the “beach party” and everything that had happened. This has
                        lingered to this day.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>EICHER: It really was in some ways a disaster and it was very sad. But maybe it
                    was inevitable. Liberia had been ruled since the 1840s by the Americo-Liberians;
                    the capital city, Monrovia, was named after President Monroe. They had
                    established a basically stable, mildly prosperous society, considering the
                    circumstances and what they had to work with. They were very close to the United
                    States for all kinds of reasons of history and even family connections. But, in
                    some ways they were perhaps not all that different from white settlers in other
                    parts of Africa. The Americos controlled most of the political and economic
                    power, while the indigenous groups, or “tribes,” in many cases had little to
                    show for a century and a half of independence. There was growing disaffection
                    among the indigenous groups, and this group of young enlisted men saw an
                    opportunity to take over the government and did so quite brutally. A lot of
                    prominent leaders were tied to stakes on the beach and gunned down, so it was
                    quite dramatic and traumatic for the United States as well as for Liberia.</p>
                <p>These gentlemen who took over the countrDoe and his palpretty much came from one
                    tribe, the Khrans of eastern Liberia, one of the poorest and most remote groups.
                    The Khrans were a fairly small percentage of the populatiomaybe 15% if I
                    remember righand so their takeover also sowed the seeds for further ethnic
                    strife later on in Liberia. But they were able to hold it together for a while,
                    more or less. The coup-makers were a fairly small group and some of the members
                    of the group soon fell out with each other. In fact, one of my amusing African
                    possessions is a T-shirt I bought in the marketplace in Monrovia when I visited,
                    that has the pictures of the “heroes of the revolution.” The shirt has printed
                    across the front six photographs of the six enlisted men who led the coup and
                    two of them were overprinted with big “Xs” because in the meantime they had
                    fallen out with the others and been executed themselves, so they were no longer
                    “heroes of the revolution.” But the shirts were still for sale in the market. In
                    good African fashion, they didn't want to waste good T-shirts just because the
                    people in power had changed. So they just Xed out a couple of faces and went on
                    selling them. I guess it was maybe the African version of the Soviet practice of
                    painting past political leaders out of pictures, after they had fallen out with
                    the regime.</p>
                <p>So, this was the situation when I came and took over the desk in 1981. Sergeant
                    Doe was really not capable at that point at all of trying to run a government
                    effectively or to run an economy. I mean, he needed a lot of help and when the
                    Americans went to him and offered help, he gladly accepted it. In fact, he
                    turned out to be very well disposed towards the United States. He was not
                    ideologically driven at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any help from the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>EICHER: No, the UN didn't really get involved. There was no international crisis
                    surrounding the coup, no threat to international peace and security. That was
                    before the days of big UN missions in Africa and elsewhere. Liberia was seen
                    internationally as sort of an American responsibility, in the same way that
                    France might be expected to help out one of its former colonies that was having
                    problems.</p>
                <p>We learned about Doe as time went along. He was pro-American partly because one
                    of his teachers when he was a boy had been a Peace Corps volunteer who he had
                    stayed in touch with and was quite close to. This American fellow, I can't
                    remember his name, would go back to Liberia from time to time to visit with Doe.
                    Once or twice we tried to use him to reinforce messages we were trying to
                    instill about the economy, or whatever, but he was really more of just a
                    personal friend to Doe. In fact, when Doe visited the United States a while
                    later, one of the main things he wanted to do was go visit his Peace Corps
                    friend.</p>
                <p>The Liberians needed help on many fronts. A lot of the tiers of government had
                    been wiped out. The economy had previously been pretty solid, with big foreign
                    investments in rubber and iron ore, but investors were very frightened and there
                    was even talk of pulling out. We wanted to reassure them by showing that a
                    responsible government was going to be taking over. The government, and Doe in
                    particular, seemed to turn to us for almost everything, for almost every
                    decision from the biggest to the smallest things. At one point, Doe promoted
                    himself from sergeant to five-star generathat shows you something about hiand he
                    came to us to ask for the five-star insignias because they didn't have any in
                    Liberia. Could we get those for him, please? We did. At the other end of the
                    spectrum, his foreign minister came to me on the desk once and wanted to have a
                    discussion with me about defining the goals of the Liberian revolution and in
                    what direction it ought to go.</p>
                <p>We worked hard to get them more assistance. I spent a lot of time working on
                    that. One of the biggest challenges I had was working on an IMF (International
                    Monetary Fund) program that would stabilize the economy, and then keeping the
                    program on track by finding ways to help the Liberians meet their quarterly IMF
                    targets, sometimes through sleight of hand. Every three months I'd arrange for
                    the release of a tranche of Liberia's ESF (economic support funds, a U.S.
                    assistance program) at a proper moment so they would have money in the bank on
                    the day they had to meet their IMF targets. The IMF would then release more aid,
                    which would keep them going for another three months. I also dealt a lot with
                    some of the big American banks. When we couldn't release the ESF on time, we
                    arranged with the banks to provide bridge loans to Liberia with our next ESF
                    payment as collateral. We were very anxious to keep Liberia from defaulting on
                    any of its international economic obligations, its loans. We worked with the
                    so-called “Paris Club” and “London Club” of lenders to restructure the country's
                    debt so it wouldn't default. There were a lot of cliff-hangers, where we worked
                    hard to get things done before default deadlines. I learned a lot about the IMF
                    and the World Bank and international economics.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>There were all kinds of other U.S. interests in Liberia that took a lot of time
                    and effort from the desk. The U.S. had a Coast Guard facility in Liberia, sort
                    of an antennae farm, that was just one of three around the world that was, I
                    think, the first global positioning system, used to guide ships using satellite
                    navigation. There was a big Voice of America station there that transmitted to
                    much of Africa. The main Firestone Tire and Rubber plantation was there. Another
                    American company had a big iron mining concern up north. There was also the
                    Liberia flag registry, you know, almost every merchant ship in the world flew
                    the flag of either Liberia or Panama. The Liberian flag registry was actually
                    based in Washington, run by a bank with offices across from the White House. We
                    dealt with them from the desk regularly, you know, running interference for them
                    with the Liberian government and being reassuring that people could continue to
                    register their ships and that the Liberian government was not suddenly going to
                    cause problems for international shippers. So, there were a lot of different
                    things going on.</p>
                <p>There were also a lot of high-level visits back and forth which we had to
                    organize. Official Liberian visitors to the United States caused an endless
                    series of problems and amusements. Doe himself wanted desperately to meet with
                    President Reagan and our ambassador judged that he might react very badly if we
                    couldn't produce a meeting. The White House wasn't enthusiastic about meeting
                    Doe, and we had to make all the usual arguments about how important Liberia was
                    to U.S. interests. The first time we tried, with great effort, we got him an
                    invitation to meet with the vice president (George H.W. Bush). Doe rejected this
                    in a funk. It started to become something which honestly threatened relations,
                    you know, if the president couldn't find time to meet with him, why should Doe
                    keep taking our advice on policy issues. We finally made the visit happen and it
                    happened on very short notice. I think another foreign leader must've cancelled
                    for some reason and Doe was given his slot, with only a couple of weeks notice.
                    We had extremely little time to prepare for his visit, which was termed an
                    “official working visit.” By the time the visit was approved, we were already
                    past the normal deadlines for getting briefing papers done and making
                    arrangements with the Secret Service, and Protocol and so forth. We had to work
                    around the clock to get everything done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem or concern, press concern, or public
                        concern and repugnance about Doe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There certainly was, at first, and that lingered on. But, as I said,
                    there was a policy decision to try to rehabilitate this guy rather than the
                    alternative of cutting him loose. So, the point is that we cared about Liberia,
                    and while Doe wasn't the person we might have chosen, he was what we had to work
                    with. We didn't feel like we could or should abandon the country. And, Doe was
                    turning out to be pro-American and trying to keep things moving generally in
                    direction we wanted, albeit amidst lots of corruption and self-enrichment and so
                    forth. We had to struggle constantly against this, which we did with middling
                    success.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>When Doe finally did get to the White House, we had an interesting anecdote.
                    After we worked all those late nights and weekends to put together all those
                    perfect briefing papers, as is required when a head of state visits the White
                    House, President Reagan apparently didn't read any of them. He introduced Doe to
                    the press corps as “Chairman Moe.” We were mortified! It's not as if it was a
                    complicated name or anything. There was the president, who we had worked so hard
                    to brief, making a huge gaffe right in front of the press. We were afraid it
                    would be an irritation and detract from the visit. We figured that Reagan must
                    somehow have associated him either with Chairman Mao or, more likely, with
                    Curly, Larry and Moe, the Three Stooges. Anyway, despite the blunder, Reagan
                    apparently very much impressed Doe and the visit was a big success.</p>
                <p>Some other Liberian visits went even less smoothly. While I was on the desk, I
                    got a call one night in the middle of the night from the New York police
                    department. They said they had arrested a fellow who was in an altercation with
                    a prostitute, and the guy was claiming to be a cabinet minister from Liberia. I
                    had to admit that yes, there was a cabinet minister from Liberia by that name
                    who was in the United States on a visit. That, unfortunately, was kind of
                    typical of the quality of some of the Liberians who visited us on the desk. In
                    this case the matter resolved itself when the woman declined to press charges
                    against the minister, maybe because she would have gotten charged, too. Or
                    maybe, as the DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary) laughed when I told him the story
                    in the morning, she didn't want to hang around the police station any more since
                    in her business, time is money.</p>
                <p>To be fair, there were also some good people in the government. I think of Ellen
                    Johnson-Sirleaf who is now President of Liberia, and there were others, too. But
                    we did have to deal with a lot of clowns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Liberia fit into the African Bureau? Did people
                        giggle or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, of course, for some of them Liberia seemed like a joke. If fact, in
                    retrospect much of it seems like a joke to me. Even at the time, you couldn't
                    help laughing about some of it. But we were working hard and were much invested
                    in trying to make Liberia a success, so some of it was depressing rather than
                    funny.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>If I didn't have so many Liberian visitors to my office, I would have put a sign
                    over the door that said “Colonial Office,” because we seemed to be involved in
                    everything. It was so different from what my colleagues in West African Affairs
                    were involved in with their countries. But again, Liberia was “our” problem,
                    America's problem. We did get a fair amount of attention from senior people. The
                    White House visit was just one example; not many African leaders made it to the
                    White House. The assistant secretary for Africa, Chester Crocker, was focused
                    very heavily on Southern Africa, so we would only occasionally get his
                    involvement in Liberia. But from all the deputy assistant secretaries and
                    elsewhere in the government we could always get a little bit of attention for
                    Liberia when we needed it. Generally people would roll their eyes as if to say
                    “Oh, no. Not Liberia again. What do you want us to do this time?” If it was
                    Liberia, it was almost certain to be bad news of some kind. But for all the
                    eye-rolling, they would usually agree to do whatever it was that needed to be
                    done to help keep Liberia on track. Although it was a struggle, we could usually
                    get the resources we needed, unlike my Africa Bureau colleagues, who were always
                    struggling for a few extra AID dollars and usually could not get them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the issue of blood diamonds come up at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, that was before blood diamonds became an issue. The terrible civil
                    wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone didn't come until long after I had left the
                    desk. There was a little bit of diamond smuggling going on, but it wasn't being
                    used to fund conflicts. Liberia was not a diamond producer but diamonds were
                    produced next-door in Sierra Leone and I think also in another neighboring
                    state, Guinea, and then were smuggled out through Liberia. So there were certain
                    things going on with diamonds, but not to pay for civil wars the way it happened
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody messing around in Liberia with Qadhafi? The
                        Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Qadhafi was certainly trying get some influence there. Right after the
                    coup he made a big overture to Liberia, which was apparently well enough
                    received that it scared the U.S. into taking a friendlier attitude toward Doe
                    rather than a hostile one. So it could have ended up quite differently if we had
                    adopted a different attitude towards Doe. As for the Soviets, they were not a
                    factor in Liberia; it was too much of an American sphere of influence. I'm not
                    sure they even had an embassy there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Libya was pretty well out of the picture. Liberia was really very, very
                    solidly in the American camp while I was there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the black caucus in Congress or the
                        African-American movement in the United States? Was there an affinity
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There was. There were a lot of ties going way back between the
                    African-American community in the U.S. and the Americo-Liberians; these were
                    some of the things which had suffered from the coup. I think the Black Caucus
                    generally, by the time I got there, which was a year after the coup, took an
                    attitude much the same as the administration did. You know, we don't like what
                    happened, but we need to work with this fellow as long as he continues to be
                    pro-American; there is a long history of American ties and contacts in Liberia
                    and we need to keep them alive and rebuild them. In fact, people used to roll
                    their eyes whenever I wrote one of my memos saying “Liberia, our oldest and
                    closest friend in Africa....” It was such a clich�, but it was true and I had to
                    keep reminding people who didn't deal with Africa that Liberia wasn't just
                    another African basket case. It was our basket case.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything going on in Liberia in terms of a
                        movement against this group that took over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not that I knew or that we could discern. Doubtless there was already
                    some grumbling by people who still weren't getting their piece of the pie. And
                    Doe had set a bad precedent, established the model, you know, by staging a coup.
                    When one group of sergeants takes over, another little group of sergeants starts
                    thinking “they did it, so why can't we?” On top of that, there was a growing
                    feeling that Doe was favoring his own Khran people, so that set the stage for
                    other groups to be dissatisfied. In short, while I was on the desk there didn't
                    seem to be any immediate threat to Doe, but the government was far from
                    efficient and it didn't take a deep analysis to figure out that the same thing
                    could happen to Doe as he did to the Americos. In the end, a few years after I
                    left the desk, he was ousted and very brutally tortured and murdered. The one
                    thing that seemed over was that the power of the Americo-Liberians had been
                    smashed and it wasn't going to come back. In that sense, Doe's coup was indeed a
                    revolution; it changed the social order as well as the government.</p>

                <p>EICHER: Nothing in Liberia, no. But it was one of the quirks of working in West
                    African Affairs that there always seemed to be a coup somewhere or an evacuation
                    somewhere else. There were lots of precipitous turnovers of government in the
                    region. So, there were continually, it seemed, task forces set up in the State
                    Department Operations Center to deal with Ghana or whatever other country might
                    be having a coup at the time. Everyone in the office would get dragooned to help
                    work on these task forces, so I did my share of weekends and night shifts on the
                    Ghana task force or whatever task force.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, it was certainly our biggest overall establishment in West Africa
                    so I wouldn't be surprised if we did, but I don't recall any specific instance
                    of it.</p>
                <p>We did also have a lot of American visitors to Liberia, which we encouraged. We
                    had a very activist ambassador, Bill Swing, who would try to drum up visits from
                    as many prominent people as possible, to help people understand Liberia and to
                    build ties. He was very good at that. So there were, for example, a lot of
                    congressmen going, from the Black Caucus and the African Affairs Subcommittee
                    and others, who we would have to brief. Swing also managed to get people like
                    the commandant of the Coast Guard to go out and visit since there was a Coast
                    Guard facility there. He even got the U.S. postmaster general to visit; I
                    remember that because I was in Liberia at the same time as he was; we were both
                    staying at the ambassador's residence together. I think the idea was to get help
                    for the Liberian postal system and to encourage them to get some extra revenue
                    by printing stamps that collectors would want to buy. All the visits did broaden
                    the number of U.S. friends of Liberia and the base of Americans who knew about
                    and were interested in Liberia. It was a very skillful policy by the ambassador
                    and I admired him for it and learned a lot from him about how to work the
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Liberia used as an entre point? Did people come to
                        Liberia and then go off to see other parts of Africa? I'm talking about
                        people who were important politically or economically or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>EICHER: I don't recall. Perhaps being an African desk officer, you get kind of
                    parochial. So maybe people were using it as a jumping off point, but I guess I
                    wouldn't have cared much about where else they were going. On the other hand, if
                    I ever heard someone was going elsewhere in Africa, I would get in touch with
                    Swing right away and see if we could convince them to add Liberia to the trip.
                    Swing and I got along very well and started to think alike on Liberia issues. If
                    he needed something from Washington I could usually get it organized for him and
                    if I needed a boost on something, I could always get him to send in a cable at a
                    crucial moment to help sway policy discussions in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about trying to attract investment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was really more a case of trying to keep the existing investments
                    there during a tenuous period; getting big new investments at the time I was on
                    the desk was not really in the cards. The embassy was trying to get the
                    government people to stop harassing the business people, to adopt policies that
                    would keep the business people there. We spent a lot of time trying to pressure
                    the government on those kinds of issues.</p>
                <p>There were also some other big economic issues that we spent a tremendous amount
                    of time on. Liberia still used American currency, which was actually one of the
                    things which saved the economy. They couldn't print their own money and that
                    kept the currency stable and to some extent kept the deficit from getting out of
                    hand. But, contrary to our advice, they started minting their own dollar coins.
                    They tended to be called “Doe dollars,” they had a picture of Sammy Doe on them.
                    They were supposed to be the equivalent of U.S. dollars and started out as such,
                    but very quickly declined in value. Nevertheless, the big transactions were
                    still done in U.S. dollars and that did help the foreign investors and protected
                    the local people against runaway inflation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left in 1983 were things fairly
                        solid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They were fairly solid. At least within the African context. You couldn't
                    say that this was a wonderful, responsible government but it was a government
                    that had done a lot of things that it might not otherwise have done to try to
                    stabilize itself. It was slowly becoming respectable. Doe was wearing suits and
                    ties rather than fatigues. He very much wanted to be seen as a respectable
                    player on the world stage. Some universitin South Korea, I thineven gave him an
                    honorary doctorate and he started calling himself “Dr. Doe” instead of General
                    Doe. The investors were starting to settle down. The IMF program was working,
                    more or less, most of the time. So you could be reasonably hopeful that Liberia
                    was going to get back on track. You know, we didn't “lose Liberia” on my watch,
                    which was actually something of an accomplishment. Things there tended to
                    improve, quite a bit, actually, during my two years on the desk. Still, you
                    couldn't say that it was solid yet.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Liberia have representation at the annual United
                        Nations get-together in the fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Oh, sure. They were always there and they even sent their vice head of
                    state one year. His name was Podier. His visit to New York was another wonderful
                    Liberian travel story. Podier arrived in New York and the Liberian mission had
                    done virtually nothing to prepare the logistics for his visit. They expected his
                    very small security detachment, provided by State Department diplomatic
                    security, to do all kinds of things for him which were way beyond their mandate.
                    I got lots of complaints from DS (Diplomatic Security) about these “miserable
                    Liberians.” The best story, I think, was when Podier was to have his courtesy
                    call on the secretary-general of the UN, who was Javier Perez Cuellar at the
                    time. Podier and six companions showed up downstairs at their hotel and the only
                    vehicle there was the security vehicle. The limousine that the Liberians were
                    supposed to supply didn't show up. So, all of them piled into the DS car for the
                    trip to the UN. As they are driving to the United Nations, they spotted an army
                    surplus store on the side of the road and yelled “Stop, stop, stop!” Remember,
                    these guys were basically young corporals and sergeants from the bush, who
                    hadn't begun to grow into their roles as statesmen. So, they piled out of the DS
                    car and into the army surplus store and started trying on fatigues and checking
                    out the gear. A couple of them wandered into the peep show next-door. Podier
                    finally selected his fatigues or whatever he wanted to buy, and then they had to
                    assemble everyone else, and go find the guys at the peep show, and finally pile
                    back into the DS car and resume their trip. They ended up being way late for
                    their appointment with the UN secretary-general. We got these and other, similar
                    stories from the DS agents who accompanied them. DS was so mad that they
                    threatened to cut Liberia off, but of course they couldn't. Fortunately, aside
                    from Doe and Podier, no other Liberians asked for security escorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this, which was, in a way, not quite sideshow
                        because there were significant issues at stake, I mean, it was a country
                        where we had assets then, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I had another tour in the Department. I went to the office of the United
                    Nations Political Affairs, where I was the officer in charge of African
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It would have been from the summer of1983 to the summer of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is always, of course, an important thing to try to get
                        African votes in the UN which has so many African members. I mean, people
                        were talking about Chad and trying to drum up support for American positions
                        on other issues. I mean you must have found yourself very busy with so many
                        votes in your portfolio.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>EICHER: Very busy. But, in fact, it wasn't so much about trying to line up
                    African votes, although that sometimes entered into the job. The way the office
                    worked, if there was an issue we needed votes on, the officer responsible for
                    that issue would draft a cable to all diplomatic posts, or all members of the
                    Security Council if it was a Security Council rather than General Assembly
                    issue, setting out the U.S. position and giving talking points for the American
                    embassies and USUN (the U.S. mission to the United Nations, in New York) to use.
                    So, if the problem were, say, a Middle East issue, the officer in charge of
                    Middle Eastern affairs would have to write the cable and talking points. They
                    would clear it, of course, with me and others to make sure it was sensible and
                    appropriate for the country or countries they were sending it to, and then the
                    cable would go out to our embassies. If the cable were on an African issue, I
                    would draft it and get it cleared. Sometimes we would have to craft specific
                    points to make with specific African countries, but that was rare; there were
                    just too many issues and things happened too quickly.</p>
                <p>Occasionally I'd get a call from one of the USUN people in New York, most often,
                    in fact, from Ambassador Richard Schifter, who would say, “Look, we need four
                    more votes on this resolution or that resolution. Which African countries do you
                    think we should hit and what kind of incentives can we offer?” or, “Can you see
                    if there's a little AID money that we can offer to Guinea Bissau to win their
                    vote” on whatever issue, that sort of thing. Schifter was a master of vote
                    counting. He was not officially responsible for African Affairs at USUN, but he
                    was the only one of the five U.S. Ambassadors to the UN who seemed to care much
                    about Africa, even if it was primarily in the context of getting votes. The U.S.
                    ambassador in New York who was in charge of Africa was Alan Keyes, the same
                    Keyes who later ran unsuccessfully for president a couple of times. He had been
                    a mid-level Foreign Service Officer and he was suddenly appointed as an
                    Ambassador in New York as a result of Jeanne Kirkpatrick's intervention.
                    Although Keyes was nominally in charge of Africa at USUN, I don't know how he
                    actually spent his time; he never seemed to be involved in any of the African
                    political issues; maybe he was spending his time self-promoting. He would never
                    even return telephone calls, unlike the other ambassadors. Schifter seemed to be
                    the only U.S. ambassador in New Yorout of fivwho had a strategic, pragmatic view
                    of how to make issues work at the UN. The others were so-called “neo-cons”
                    (neo-conservatives) who seemed more focused on ideology than on getting things
                    done; they would usually rather lose a vote and stand proudly alone on principle
                    than look for an approach that might put the U.S. on the winning side. So,
                    although Schifter's calls always meant more work for me, I came to appreciate
                    his outlook. I learned a lot from him, which proved very useful during my later
                    assignment to the UN in Geneva, where vote-counting and strategic approaches to
                    specific countries were often very important in getting resolutions adopted.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>In fact, my job turned out to be mainly a Namibia job. I was chosen, selected for
                    the position, by the Africa Bureau because the position was regarded as “their
                    man” in the UN Bureau (the Bureau of International Organizations Affairs). At
                    that time, by far the biggest African issue in the UN was Southern Africa and,
                    in particular, Namibia. Namibia was starting to be a very hot issue, with the
                    U.S. much involved in negotiations aiming at Namibian independence. It turned
                    out to be just a fascinating job from that perspective. You may recall that I
                    had covered Namibia during my tour in South Africa five or six years earlier,
                    and I was still very interested in Namibia. I became part of Assistant Secretary
                    Chester Crocker's “team,” as he called it, which was a little group of half
                    dozen people who were working on the Namibian negotiations. Because Namibia was
                    technically a UN trust territory, and anything which came out of the
                    negotiations would have to be approved by the UN, UN people were very much
                    involved. There was a UN “Commissioner from Namibia,” and the secretary-general
                    himself was much concerned about Namibia. It was an issue for both the General
                    Assembly and the Security Council, as well as the UN Trusteeship Council. So,
                    Namibia became the issue for my tour in IO/UNP (Bureau of International
                    Organizations Affairs, Office of United Nations Political Affairs). I spent far
                    and away more time on Namibia than anything else; well over half my time on just
                    that country, out of a continent with 50 countries.</p>
                <p>There were other things, of course, that I did have to spend time on. Other
                    Southern African issues were always hoSouth Africa, of course, was still an
                    apartheid state at the time, which was a very big issue at the UN. There were
                    lots of UN votes on South African issues. At one point during my tour, the U.S.
                    even voted in favor of a Security Council resolution increasing sanctions on
                    South Africa; I was proud of my role in that, which was an achievement,
                    especially since it was the Reagan administration. There were also other African
                    issues that arose at the UN, things like Western Sahara and the problems in the
                    Comoros. Sometimes, I'd even get sucked into non-African issues. When the
                    Russians shot down a South Korean Airlines Boeing 747 full of passengers that
                    strayed over the Soviet Union, I was dragooned to hand carry up to New York some
                    huge charts and photos for our ambassadoJeanne Kirkpatricto use during a
                    Security Council meeting. We had to get special permission to take the big
                    portfolio on board the plane, since it was way over-sized.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>And, of course, there was the annual meeting of the General Assembly, which
                    involved lots of preparatory work, talking points and so forth. I'd also go to
                    New York for the UNGA (United Nations General Assembly) each year, for the
                    opening week or so, when all the heads of state and foreign ministers would be
                    there. I'd be attached to Crocker, rather than to my own assistant secretary. He
                    would meet with African leaders and I'd go along to some of them. A meeting with
                    Robert Mugabe sticks in my mind; he came across as quite a hard-liner, sort of
                    proud to be a Marxist and anti-Western, even way back then. Sometimes we'd have
                    a private room in a hotel to meet people, but often it would be in the UN
                    “delegates' lounge.” That was a terrible place to have meetingit was incredibly
                    crowded and noisy during the big UNGA week and everyone would be looking over
                    your shoulder and it would be hard to hear. It would even be hard to find places
                    to sit, it was so crowded. Me or my counterpart at USUN, Gerald Scott, would
                    have to go save seats well before a meeting. Poor Gerald usually got stuck with
                    that, since he was the control officer, but I remember helping out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On Namibia, when you took over, when you had the job, what
                        was your impression of Chester Crocker and “constructive engagement” and all
                        that? I'm talking about from your own way of looking at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, there are at least a couple different things I guess I should say.
                    I had already dealt with Chet Crocker a little bit when I was on the Liberia
                    desk. Liberia was not at all the top of his agenda, but Liberia issues would get
                    to him from time to time. And, of course, there were the Africa bureau staff
                    meetings where I would see him and occasionally there would be a Liberian
                    visitor that I would sit with him with. So, through this kind of day-to-day
                    business I got to know him a little bit. I liked him very much and I liked his
                    style. He was thoughtful, low-key and friendly and a gentleman. He seemed to
                    appreciate advice and ideas. He was a good person to work for. I liked that.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>As for “constructive engagement,” I was not really a fan of that at all. But the
                    policy was not really all that different from what the U.S. had been doing
                    before, it was mainly a different name and a different spin, and perhaps a
                    greater intensity of engagement. It's not as if the Carter administration had
                    broken ties with South Africa; they were also engaged. Constructive engagement
                    as a policy was more complex than it seemed on the surface; it did have
                    reasonable policy foundation that was trying to move things in southern Africa
                    in the right direction. Opponents of the policy generally equated “constructive
                    engagement” with cozying up to South Africa, but it was really regional policyou
                    had to engage with South Africa if wanted to make progress on Namibia and other
                    regional issues, as well as on South African internal issues. So, it was
                    something I thought I could work with. When I joined the Foreign Service, I had
                    made the decision that I would try to influence events and make my contribution
                    to change from inside the policy process rather than trying to promote change by
                    protesting from outside. So, this job was a chance to try to do that. Crocker
                    was the kind of guy who would listen to advice, and who could be influenced by
                    sensible arguments, so I might be able to make a difference. And, of course,
                    peace in Namibia was something I believed in very much and it was exciting to be
                    involved in that process. So, despite my initial policy reservations, I was
                    happy to give it a try, especially since Namibia had been one of my beats a few
                    years earlier so I was already interested and had some good background
                    experience. It was nice to be back a few years later seeing what was happening
                    to Namibia. Negotiations were starting to move at that point. This was already
                    two or three years into the administration.</p>
                <p>Crocker's management approach more than lived up to my expectations. He had
                    “team” meetings regularly to discuss everything that was going on in the
                    negotiations. These almost had the atmosphere of university seminars, which
                    might not be odd since Crocker was a professor. There were only about half a
                    dozen of us, and he would listen carefully to all points of view. In fact, he
                    seemed to have structured the team to include people with differing points of
                    view, or at least that's how it turned out in practice. A couple of the team
                    members would usually argue for a very tough line on every issue, a sort of
                    “punch them in the nose” approach, and a couple of us would usually argue for a
                    softer, more diplomatic approach. There were “memo wars,” with each of us
                    drafting short memos to Crocker setting out our different points of view on the
                    issues that came up and arguing for different courses of action. Crocker liked
                    the memos; he always read them carefully, almost like a professor reading school
                    papers and making little written comments on them. So, we got the feeling that
                    our views were really appreciated and taken into account. Sometimes our
                    arguments would win the day and we'd be making policy on a key issue. It was
                    exciting stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue on Namibia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>EICHER: Namibia had been a German colony, South West Africa, before World War I.
                    It was taken over by the British and South Africans during World War I and then
                    administered by the South Africans under a League of Nations mandate. By the
                    1970s and 1980s, the South Africans were still unwilling to let it go, and so
                    the big issue was to get the South Africans to agree to Namibian independence.
                    Back when I was serving in South Africa, the South Africans had started a whole
                    process to take Namibia to independence in a way that was not at all approved by
                    the international community. The UN passed a number of resolutions, particularly
                    Security Council resolutions 385 and 435, which said that Namibia would have to
                    become independent through elections under UN supervision and control. The issue
                    was really how to convince the South Africans to let go of Namibia in a way that
                    would be internationally acceptable.</p>
                <p>Before I moved to UN affairs, the administration seized on a strategy that
                    included a lot of carrot, as well as stick. They had asked themselves, “what can
                    we give the South Africans as an incentive to get them out of Namibia?” The
                    answer they came up with was to convince the South Africans to give Namibia its
                    independence in return for getting the Cuban troops out of Angola. This would
                    benefit the South Africans by eliminating the great Soviet, communist, threat to
                    southern Africa that they were so worried about. In theory, then, Namibia would
                    become independent without becoming communist and posing a security threat to
                    South Africa. This strategy was called “linkage,” linking the Cuban withdrawal
                    to Namibian independence. It was a clever strategy in the sense that if it
                    worked, the United States would win all around, both by getting the Soviet,
                    Cuban, threat out of Southern Africa and by getting Namibia independence. This
                    was still in the days of the Cold War, and in a sense the Namibia/Angola
                    conflicts were partly proxy wars for the great powers. On the other hand, the
                    strategy was much criticized internationally, because why should Namibia be held
                    hostage to what's happening in Angola? All the black African stateand most of
                    the worlofficially rejected linkage, although they would still talk with us
                    about implementing it. Linkage was the policy pursued for many years by the
                    United States, ultimately successfully, although not while I was still working
                    on the issue.</p>
                <p>So, we were involved in a series of negotiations with the South Africans, the
                    Angolans, the African “Front Line States,” and the UN and others. I was
                    personally involved in a lot of these. I traveled with Crocker to Southern
                    Africa and I always accompanied him to New York. He would go up to New York
                    approximately every six weeks to brief the Secretary-General, who at the time
                    was Perez de Cuellar. I probably spent more time with the Secretary-General than
                    any of my colleagues at USUN, except Jeanne Kirkpatrick maybe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Crocker in the United Nations?
                        I ask because he was coming out of a Republican administration and some
                        other Republicans were not overly friendly to the UN. There was a whole
                        right wing Republican element that was almost egregiously anti-UN.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>EICHER: I don't think it was quite as bad then as it has become since. I mean,
                    there was not quite as much of today's attitude of “we have to destroy the
                    United Nations,” or “let's cut the top ten floors off the UN headquarters in New
                    York and no one will notice.” You remember of course, that George Bush, the
                    first George Bush, who was still vice president at the time we're talking about,
                    had been ambassador to the United Nations. I think there was a realization that
                    the UN was a useful organization, that it was one that we needed to work with. A
                    lot of the problems between the U.S. and the UN at the time came from the
                    outside, Jesse Helms and other members of Congress, who were withholding our UN
                    dues, which was a real mess. You know, I think there's a widespread, general
                    mischaracterization or misunderstanding of the UN among Americans. Everyone
                    complains that it's ineffective or “do-nothing,” but actually the UN can only do
                    what the member states want it and allow it to do; it doesn't really have
                    independent power to go out and do things on its own. So, often the same people
                    who are badmouthing the UN for not doing this or thafor example, “the UN failed
                    in Bosnia” or “the UN failed in Rwanda” are the same policy-makers who would not
                    authorize the UN to use force in Bosnia or Rwanda. It's a bit perverse. The UN
                    is an easy whipping boy but it really only reflects the lowest common
                    denominator of the international community.</p>
                <p>I think Crocker had quite a constructive approach to the UN. Just the fact that
                    he went so often to consult with the Secretary General and other UN officials
                    shows that he had a good approach. He accepted that the solution to Namibia had
                    to be in the UN context, to meet UN stipulations, if it was going to work. I
                    never remember him taking a particularly negative view.</p>
                <p>Jeanne Kirkpatrick was ambassador in New York at that point and she was quite a
                    powerful and difficult figure. Namibia seemed to be one of the few issues that
                    she yielded on, for whatever reason, letting Crocker handle it by himself. I
                    suppose she had things that mattered more to her. She just didn't get involved.
                    Even when we saw the Secretary General, she never came along. We very rarely
                    briefed her when we went to New York, although we would meet with some of her
                    deputies. She was supportive of what we were doing and if we needed her
                    occasionally to make a point in a speech, or something like that, she would do
                    it. So I guess I was lucky compared to my colleagues in UNP, who were very
                    scared of Kirkpatrick because she tended to get involved unpredictably in issues
                    and she had a bad temper. Since she was a member of the Cabinet, she would go
                    directly to the White House if anybody disagreed with her on anything. I was
                    happy not to have her involved in my issues. I was affected peripherally as she
                    exerted tighter and tighter control from New York over at the UN Affairs Bureau
                    in Washington. Eventually, we could not send an instruction cable to New York
                    from the State Department without first sending it up in draft to be approved by
                    USUN. If they approved the draft, then we could send it officially to them. It
                    didn't really affect me on Namibia, but it did on a few other issues, although
                    for me this was mainly proceduraI can't remember an instance where USUN
                    disagreed with something I wanted to sent them. It was really bizarre that an
                    Ambassador would have the power to clear her own instructions, but that was just
                    the way the system was. The assistant secretary for international organizations
                    was more or less a nonentity.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Gregory Newell, I believe his name was. He was a young political
                    appointee and I think he understood what the situation was. He focused mainly on
                    management issues at the UN and on the other UN agencies rather than on
                    political issues at the UN as such, because clearly he was not going to be able
                    to take control. In fact, we sometimes thought he was put there specifically to
                    avoid having a strong assistant secretary who might clash with Kirkpatrick. I
                    remember when I joined the Bureau making my courtesy call on Newell and him
                    giving me his list of the Bureau's priorities. I was amazed that they were all
                    things like cutting UN budgets and improving management; there was nothing in
                    there at all about making peace or finding solutions to international problems
                    or any political issues.</p>
                <p>But I was in a funny situation. Although Newell was my assistant secretary, I
                    really worked for Crocker. I had a good office director in UNP, Ed Dillery, and
                    there was a good DAS, Roger Kirk. They seemed delighted to have one of their
                    staff so deeply involved in the Namibia negotiations, so they didn't give me any
                    trouble; they were very supportive. In general, there was so much going on in
                    New York all the time on so many issues, that I only had to keep them very
                    generally briefed on what was going on with Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, how did the Cuban problem fit into
                        the situation in Angola? In the first place, what seemed to be in it for the
                        Cubans to be fighting there and second, why would they want to get out if
                        that's what the U.S. wanted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, that was an issue. We certainly were not dealing directly with the
                    Cubans. They had a good-sized military establishment in Angola at that time.
                    There were also, I believe, smaller establishments in some other parts of Africa
                    as well, in Ethiopia and in much smaller numbers in two or three other places.
                    This was part of their policy at the time. It was the Cold War, and the Cubans
                    were a Soviet proxy. I have no doubt that the Soviets were paying the bills.
                    But, even from the Cuban perspective, sending troops to somewhere like Angola,
                    which had a Marxist government and its own civil war going on, would fit right
                    in with the Cuban policy of trying to spread the worldwide revolution. This was
                    after the days of Che Guevara, but the Cuban idea of trying to spread the
                    revolution was still alive.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>There was a sometimes vicious civil war going on in Angola between two of the
                    former liberation movements which had been fighting against the Portuguese. The
                    MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) was in power in the capital
                    and was the official government, the ones we had to negotiate with. UNITA
                    (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), under Jonas Savimbi,
                    controlled the southern half of Angola and was supported by the South Africans.
                    The U.S. was also secretly, or not so secretly, funneling assistance to UNITA.
                    The Cubans were in Angola supporting the MPLA government. The civil war teetered
                    back and forth. Sometimes UNITA would move north and control most of the
                    country; sometimes it would be beaten back closer to the border region.</p>
                <p>The Cubans were apparently very competent troops, and that worried the South
                    Africans. The various Angolan factions were not terribly effective fighters so
                    the South Africans didn't feel much threatened by them; they felt like they
                    could handle the Africans without much problem. But having the Cubans there was
                    different. The South Africans weren't scared of the Cubanthere was no threat
                    that the Cubans themselves would try to cross into Namibia or South Africbut
                    having the Cubans there complicated life for the South Africans. The Cubans made
                    the MPLA stronger and threatened Savimbi. If the Cubans got to the
                    Angolan-Namibian border, they would probably assist SWAPO in making incursions
                    into Namibia. So, the Cubans made it a more difficult and dangerous situation
                    for the South Africans. If Namibia were to become independent while the Cubans
                    were in Angola, the Cubans might well be a real threat to Namibia. If Namibia
                    were to get internationally recognized independence, the new government might
                    even invite the Cubans into Namibia. So, even though it was the U.S., not the
                    South Africans, which came up with the idea of “linkage,” it was a real
                    incentive to the South Africans.</p>
                <p>Just one more fun point on the Cuban troops in Angola. The South Africans could
                    tell where the Cubans were based in Angola through aerial photography. Suddenly,
                    after the Cubans arrived in Angola, the aerial photos started showing that
                    baseball diamonds were appearing at some Angolan military bases and near other
                    concentrations of soldiers. Now, the Angola soldiers would, of course, play
                    soccer to amuse themselves when they had free time; Africans were not baseball
                    players. The Cubans, on the other hand, were great baseball players. So, it
                    followed that if you saw a baseball diamond in an aerial photograph, it was a
                    sure sign of a Cuban presence. I don't know if the Cubans ever knew they were
                    giving themselves away in that manner, but I always thought that was an
                    interesting story of how baseball fit into southern African diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there talks going on essentially between United
                        States and Cuba over this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>EICHER: No, the talks were mainly with the South Africans and with the Angolans.
                    I personally was never involved in the Angolan talks at all. There was an
                    informal division of labor within the team, with the Africa Bureau's principal
                    deputy assistant secretary, Frank Wisner, and the Angola desk officer doing most
                    of the talks with the Angolans. Crocker and two or three others, including
                    myself, were dealing with the South Africans and the other so-called Front Line
                    States. And the big goal was to get what we called the “calendario,” a calendar,
                    a schedule for withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The carrot for Angola was
                    an independent Namibia, which would make it much more difficult for the South
                    Africans to be able to help out Jonas Savimbi and UNITA, in their guerrilla war
                    against the Angolan government. South African was giving assistance to Savimbi
                    through its bases in northern Namibia. South Africa had even occupied part of
                    southern Angola with its own troops, ostensibly to keep out the SWAPO guerrillas
                    who would occasionally try to infiltrate from Angola into Namibia.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the carrot for Angola was that if Namibia became independent as a result
                    of our negotiations, then the South African forces would withdraw from both
                    Angola and Namibia. They would be a thousand miles from Angola, where they
                    couldn't help Savimbi as effectively. The Angolans had ostensibly brought in the
                    Cubans on the basis that South Africa was occupying part of Angolas well as to
                    help fight UNITand they had said at some point that they wouldn't need the
                    Cubans to defeat UNITA if the South Africans weren't there. So, there was a real
                    incentive for the Angolans to cooperate with the peace process, and to discuss
                    “linkage” with us at the same time they officially rejected it.</p>
                <p>For the two years I was on the job, the Angolans danced around very adroitly and
                    deftly. They showed great interest in the U.S.-led negotiations and they did
                    talk regularly with us. They never made flat rejections that would have ended
                    the negotiations. You know, they were sufficiently involved to keep us engaged
                    and believing that progress was possible. And, there was actually occasional
                    progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>The biggest breakthrough we had during my time was what we called the
                    “disengagement.” We were able to get an agreement from the South Africans to
                    pull their troops back completely out of Angola into Namibia, and the Angolans
                    to withdraw military from the border areas in return, and to keep the Cubans out
                    of the border area. This agreement really was a big deal. It showed the policy
                    was working and producing results. We thought the disengagement could create the
                    political basis and political will and momentum to really launch into Namibian
                    independence. This agreement was finally nailed down during a wonderful trip I
                    took with Crocker around southern Africa, where we met half a dozen presidents.
                    This was one of my wonderful Foreign Service experiences, being involved in a
                    peace process that was working and meeting with a whole range of prominent
                    leaders that I had been reading about since my university days. We met in Zambia
                    with President KaundI've got a great picture of him serving me teand in Tanzania
                    with President Nyerere and in Mozambique with Samora Machel. We even went to
                    Malawi, even though it wasn't regarded as a Front Line State, where we had an
                    amazing meeting with President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, an ancient dictator with a
                    twinkle in his eye, who sang us songs in an African language and quoted stanzas
                    of Caesar in Latin. He gave us a British-style, fancy high tea in one of his
                    palaces in Kasungu, an out-of-the-way little town; I remember that he took five
                    sugars in his tea. I wrote up what I thought was an amusing cable on the
                    meeting, with the subject line “Kamuzu in Kasungu;” I even mentioned his five
                    sugars.</p>
                <p>All these guys were old-time independence leaders who were still presidents of
                    their various countries. Nyerere and Kaunda were the real leaders of the Front
                    Line States, the ones who mattered most. I remember Nyerere, who we met with in
                    Dodoma, a city in the middle of nowhere in Tanzania, being especially
                    impressive, and especially leery of the American initiative, at the same time as
                    he would have been delighted to see it work. We were able to go to all these
                    out-of-the-way places because we were flying in our own little plane. The
                    African presidents were all very pleased at the South African pull-back but
                    cautious about whether it would really lead to independence for Namibia. Still,
                    it was the only game in town and they admitted it was good progress. They all
                    agreed to support our efforor at least not to oppose it. So it was a good
                    success. They agreed to continue to pressure the Angolans for progress if we
                    could continue to pull the South Africans back. We also met with the South
                    Africans, of course; that was the first stop. We had to be sure they were really
                    willing to go through with the disengagement before taking it to the Front Line
                    States. The South Africans also produced Jonas Savimbi for us to meet with; we
                    met him at the home of the South African minister of defense. Savimbi was an
                    impressive fellow.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>So the agreement was reached. The South Africans began to pull back their troops.
                    And, we actually established a U.S. liaison office in Windhoek, both to monitor
                    the disengagement and in anticipation that we would make more progress and it
                    would turn into an embassy at the time of independence. We had discussed this
                    with the African leaders and they didn't object. I volunteered to go out and
                    help set up the office, USLO Windhoek (U.S. Liaison Office), the first U.S.
                    office in Namibia, and to stay there temporarily as part of its staff. Bill
                    Twaddell was the charg� at USLO, I was the DCM. It was just a short-term,
                    six-week assignment but it was fascinating. I think opening any American embassy
                    for the first time in a new country would have to be interesting. Namibia was
                    doubly seven though it wasn't actually an embasssince it was in the middle of
                    such a big political issue and was getting so much international attention, and
                    because the U.S. was the only foreign country really there on the ground and
                    involved in the negotiations. For me it was even more interesting, since I had
                    been working on the negotiations which led to the disengagement and because I
                    had worked on Namibia before and knew the internal scene a little, and how this
                    fit into the bigger picture of the negotiations. USLO got a lot of publicity;
                    there was a lot of hope that this was really going to lead to the end of the
                    Namibian problems. Everyone was very upbeat.</p>
                <p>Once I was at USLO, we got around Namibia quite a bit. We got up north, to the
                    war zone and visited South African military installations. We visited
                    Swapokmund, which was a very pretty little German colonial town that seemed like
                    it came right out of the turn of the century, and Walvis Bay, which was
                    Namibia's only port and was an issue in the negotiations, since it had been a
                    South African enclave even while the rest of Namibia was a German colony. We met
                    all the local politicians and prominent personalities, of course, many of whom
                    were the same people I had known during my South African assignment. A lot of
                    them were not very happy, since Namibian independence under international
                    auspices would mean the end of influence for many who had been operating within
                    the South African system. But there were also a lot of people pleased to see
                    progress, at last. Also, everyone seemed to like the opening of an American
                    office since it seemed to signal the end of a long isolation. We were in close
                    touch with the South African military, which gave us reports to pass on their
                    progress in pulling out of Angola. They also kept us posted on any incidents in
                    the border region. In particular, they were upset by any indications that SWAPO
                    would use the South African military pull-back to try to increase its incursions
                    from Angola into Namibia. I did a lot of political reporting.</p>
                <p>And then things began to fall apart. The Angolans still weren't producing the
                    “calendario,” which was needed if we were going to move into the next phase. And
                    the South Africans were complaining that SWAPO was still coming in across the
                    border. So, slowly it came unraveled. Things were still going well when I
                    returned to the U.S. Bill Twadell and I were only there for about six weeks. The
                    idea was that we were available immediately so we'd go out for a few weeks and
                    get things started, then the Department would send out the longer-term team to
                    replace us. The longer-term, or supposedly longer-term team, was headed by
                    Dennis Keogh, who was killed within a week or so after he got there in an
                    explosion at a gas station. It was a station that I had visited not long before.
                    The South Africans put it down to SWAPO terrorism.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a chance explosion or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They said that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, that he
                    wasn't actually targeted personally. But no one ever knew for sure. We
                    speculated a lot about who would have gained from killing him, whether it was
                    SWAPO or the South Africans. You could make a case either way, but it seemed
                    that South Africa might have the greater incentive, and certainly they were
                    better placed to pull something like that off, if they wanted to. Explosions in
                    Namibia did happen from time to time, but it was relatively rare; it's not as if
                    they were happening every day, or even every month. And SWAPO usually targeted
                    power lines and other isolated targets away from population centers; it was rare
                    for civilians to be hurt. SWAPO really was not an effective military force. It
                    didn't have much capacity to undertake attacks. So I was never entirely
                    comfortable with the idea that Keogh just happened to be somewhere when a SWAPO
                    bomb happened to go off. It wasn't impossible, but it just seemed too unlikely,
                    especially if it were a random bomb rather than a targeted one. It was a real
                    tragedy. Dennis was a good guy. I had been with him just a few days before; I
                    felt really hard hit by it. His widow later joined the Foreign Service and I got
                    to be friends with her. Another friend was killed in the same bombing, an
                    American army officer who had joined USLO Windhoek a couple of weeks before I
                    left. Very sad.</p>
                <p>The Department found a replacement for Keogh, Jake Jacobsen, who I had known
                    during my tour in South Africa. USLO remained open for about a year altogether,
                    then it started to become a political problem. As the disengagement fell apart,
                    the office in Windhoek lost its nominal raison d'etre. It started to draw
                    criticism, especially in the UN, as a U.S. diplomatic establishment that
                    shouldn't be in Namibia until after independence. The Departmenand Crocker's
                    “team” was divided on whether to close it or not. It still did some useful
                    reporting, and some people were afraid that closing it would signal failure. I
                    felt a personal attachment to the office and hated to see it closed, but in the
                    policy discussions I argued that it should be closed; it had become more of a
                    liability than an asset for us. Crocker agreed and so it was closed down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got this peace process going on over in Namibia but
                        you haven't really said much about the Namibians. Was there a Namibian
                        entity that was different, I mean, essentially an independent Namibian
                        entity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>EICHER: There were a variety of things going on. In most ways, the internal
                    situation had not progressed a lot over the past few years, I mean, it was much
                    the same as I described it when we talked about my tour in South Africa five or
                    six years earlier. There had been some evolution in internal politics. The old
                    Turnhalle conference, if I remember correctly, had reached some agreements on
                    how they would govern Namibia, and I think they had even set up a government
                    that they were running under South African auspices. I know that they still
                    talked a lot about declaring independencthat would be an unrecognized,
                    South-African backed independence, and we had to spend a lot of time warning the
                    South Africans not to let them do that since it would complicate any chance for
                    real independence.</p>
                <p>So, there were still all these internal parties, most of which were
                    ethnically-based. And they did have some power over local affairs, but South
                    Africa was still really in charge. The South Africans had started this process
                    of trying to bring Namibia to independence in a framework that they could manage
                    and control, which would be friendly to them, and having launched the process
                    they were now in the unhappy position of restraining their Namibians allies who
                    wanted to go through with independence. The racial situation was much more
                    relaxed than in South Africa. Segregation was still generally the rule, but it
                    was breaking down quickly and it was not at all as oppressive as in South
                    Africa. There were more places open to all races and there wasn't the same
                    pervasive police effort to enforce apartheid-like regulations. That was already
                    true even back when I served in South Africa a few years earlier and it was much
                    more so when I was there to open USLO.</p>
                <p>SWAPO, as I've said, was the principal liberation movement. Crocker used to call
                    it “the world's least successful liberation movement.” It certainly wasn't
                    making much progress on the battlefield but, it was recognized internationally;
                    it had official status as a UN observer; it was regarded as legitimate. The
                    South Africans would say that SWAPO only represented the Ovambos, which is one
                    of the northern tribes, but by far the largest group in Namibia, making up just
                    over half the population, I think. South Africa would have preferred a solution
                    more like what they were trying to do within South Africa, to have an ethnically
                    based government in Namibia that wouldn't be dominated by Ovambos, but give an
                    equal say to a range of much smaller groups, the Hereros and the Bushmen and so
                    forth. Curiously, SWAPO still had an internal branch that operated openly and
                    legally inside Namibia. There were also half a dozen prominent former leaders of
                    SWAPO and another, defunct liberation movement, SWANU (the South West African
                    National Union) who had returned to Namibia and were cooperating with the South
                    Africans. One of the old SWANU guys I met with, I remember, was the person who
                    first coined the term “Namibia” as a name for South West Africa. There were a
                    few others, as well. But most Namibians generally favored SWAPO and
                    internationally recognized independence. It was clear that SWAPO was the most
                    popular political force in the country and would win a free and fair
                    election.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>During the negotiations, we did meet from time to time with SWAPO, usually on our
                    trips to New York, where we would see Theo Ben Gurirab, their UN representative
                    and “foreign minister.” Sometimes we'd meet the leader of SWAPO, Sam Nujoma, who
                    was not very impressive or very effective. But we realized that we would need to
                    keep SWAPO on board if the negotiations were to succeed. That wasn't really very
                    hard to do since our goal was Namibian independence, which was also their goal.
                    But they didn't trust us and so they would never have anything positive to say
                    about what we were doing. We counted on the Front Line States to keep SWAPO in
                    line if we ever needed to. I remember that Nujoma would spend most of his time
                    traveling around Africa trying to drum up more support for SWAPO; he didn't have
                    any clear base of operations. He certainly wasn't in the field leading any kind
                    of military effort from Angola; he was much more of an armchair general. When we
                    wanted to send him a message on the status of the talks or to consult with him,
                    we would send out a cable to all African posts entitled “Where's Sam?”
                    Eventually, one of our embassies would come back with a cable saying “he's here”
                    and we'd be able to get a message to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the South Africans you all were dealing with? Did
                        they see an end game? Well, I mean how were they approaching this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They were tough cookies. The main one that we dealt with was Pik Botha,
                    who was the foreign minister and he was just a loud, blustery sort of fellow,
                    with a tendency to lecture you. He had been foreign minister for a long time; I
                    had seen him in action when I served in South Africa. He was supposedly one of
                    the more enlightened, young Afrikaners of the Nationalist Party, but with us he
                    put the emphasis on being tough and threatening. He always had a gang of
                    compatriots with him, which would include a lot of senior intelligence people,
                    you know, the head of South African military intelligence and others who would
                    frequently be at the meetings we had with Botha. Maybe he was acting so tough
                    for their sake. Anyway, they were always making threats, “we're going to invade
                    Angola” and “we're going to bomb,” and “why don't you guys understand that we're
                    doing your work for you by holding off the Soviet menace, so why are you putting
                    pressure on us?” and on and on along those kind of lines. So it was never an
                    easy negotiation with them. And for all that, we knew that Pik Botha was
                    probably more liberal and more inclined to a solution than his boss, P.W. Botha
                    (no relation), the prime minister would have been. We met the South Africans in
                    Pretoria or Cape Town, or once we had a several-day session with them in Cape
                    Verde, which was about half way between Washington and Pretoria. The Cape
                    Verdeans were one of the few African countries that would let the South Africans
                    in, and it was so out-of-the-way that we could have a meeting there with no
                    publicity. Frank Wisner used to meet the Angolans in Cape Verde, as well,
                    sometimes. Anyway, for all the South African blustering, we thought a deal on
                    Namibia was doable; it wasn't going to be easy but it could be doable. And
                    ultimately, we got it done, but not while I was still working on it.</p>

                <p>EICHER: I left there in the middle of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And wither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Cairo, Egypt, which was quite a change for me and the reason for the
                    change was really more personal than political. I still liked African affairs
                    but I had gotten to the stage where my children were too old for the American
                    schools in Africa, which usually didn't go beyond elementary school. My oldest
                    son, Cameron, would be going into his junior year of high school the following
                    September and the other two boys, Nicholas and Jeremy, were also growing up. So,
                    I turned down a little African DCM-ship since I didn't want to think about
                    putting my kids in boarding school or going off on an unaccompanied assignment.
                    What I really wanted was the Africa job in Londothat was a great job in a great
                    place, following African Affairs out of the political section in London; I'm not
                    sure the position still exists. But it wasn't coming open for another year. The
                    Africa bureau asked met to extend in UNP, but they weren't willing to commit
                    that I'd be their candidate for London if I did. We'd been back in the U.S. for
                    four years already and felt like it was time to go back out. And, since my
                    oldest son was about to start his junior year, we felt like we should either
                    transfer now or wait another two years and let him finish high school in the
                    States; we didn't want to move him for his senior year. So when it was time to
                    bid, I looked around at the various possibilities. There was a job that looked
                    interesting in the political section in Cairo. It was still Africa, even if it
                    wasn't in the Africa Bureau. NEA (the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian
                    Affairs) seemed like it would be an interesting area to work in, and this was
                    one of the rare political positions in NEA that didn't require Arabic, so it
                    wasn't a life-time commitment to the Bureau. Most important, Cairo had a good
                    American school all the way through high school, which, as I said, was a must
                    for us. And it just sounded like a good, fun place to go. I had lived in Cairo
                    when I was a little boy and had left there when I was six, and we once had a lot
                    of family members there, although not any more. So for me, there was something
                    nostalgic about Cairo. And my wife was enthusiastic about the idea of Cairo,
                    much more so even than I was. It was one of those exotic cities that held an
                    allure for her and that she had always wanted to visit. So, I bid, and NEA
                    offered me the job and I accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>EICHER: I was political officer and my portfolio was Egyptian foreign affairs. I
                    had the only non-Arabic designated position of the six positions in the
                    political section. I didn't have to learn the language because I would be
                    dealing mainly with the Foreign Ministry, where everyone spoke English. My main
                    job by far was following, and even participating in, Egypt-Israel relations.
                    Egypt and Israel had signed the Camp David Peace Accord a few years before so
                    they were at peace. But it was a “cold” peace. They really didn't get along at
                    all. The U.S. had invested a lot in the peace agreement and was determined to
                    make it work and to try to get the two counties to have better relations. I
                    think we wanted that much more than either of them did.</p>
                <p>There was what we called a “basket” of problem issues that continued to trouble
                    the relationship and I spent most of my time working on those. The biggest issue
                    by far was Taba, which was a tiny little triangle of land, only about six or
                    eight hundred meters of coastline, right on the Sinai border between Egypt and
                    Israel. Taba was just south of Eilat, on the Gulf of Aqaba. Under the terms the
                    Camp David Treaty, Israel was supposed to withdraw from all of the Sinai that it
                    occupied during the 1973 war with Egypt. Well, the Israelis had built a hotel
                    while occupying Sinai, a Sonesta Hotel, a beautiful hotel, on a nice little
                    beach in Taba. The Israelis insisted that “no, no. This is really part of
                    Israel, not part of Egypt.” When they withdrew from the rest of Sinai, they did
                    not withdraw from Taba, which they said was on their side of the border. So we
                    were trying to find a solution for the Taba problem. I ended up being deeply
                    involved in that for five years, not only while I was in Cairo, but all through
                    my next job, as well. The issue ultimately went to international arbitration and
                    Taba was eventually returned to Egypt, but that was still many years of work
                    away when I got to Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening with the hotel? Was it still being used
                        by the Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was still being used by the Israelis, yes. In fact, this is the same
                    hotel that had a big terrorist attack on it, I think two or three years ago,
                    with many people killed, and the hotel wrecked. The Sonesta in Taba was at the
                    time by far the nicest hotel in Sinai; the other places were pretty much hovels,
                    catering mainly to backpackers and low-budget scuba divers. Since then, the
                    Sinai has been developed with many fancy big-name hotels, but at the time the
                    Sonesta in Taba was the only good hotel. So it was attracting tourists from
                    Europe and from Israel. We would sometimes have our negotiating sessions right
                    there at the hotel. While Taba was under Israeli control, they allowed topless
                    bathing on the beach, in normal European style, which supposedly scandalized the
                    Egyptians. At least the newspapers always made this part of their stories when
                    they covered Taba; I never remember seeing anyone topless there, and the
                    Egyptians negotiators certainly weren't scandalized about the idea.</p>

                <p>EICHER: Most of the first year I was there it was Nick Veliotes, until he was
                    replaced by Frank Wisner, my old friend from Crocker's “team” in the Africa
                    Bureau.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Achille Lauro thing happen while you were

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That happened while I was there, in fact, just a few months after I got
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your piece of that nasty business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: This was in fact, one of a constant series of little crises that happened
                    during my two years in Egypt. It seemed to be just one nasty event after another
                    after another. All of us there in Egypt were following the Achille Lauro very
                    closely, minute-to-minute even, but we there wasn't a lot we could do from
                    Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what this was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The Achille Lauro was a cruise ship, an Italian cruise ship, doing a
                    Mediterranean cruise. It was hijacked by terrorists from a Palestinian group,
                    the Palestine Liberation Front, I think, after it had docked in Egypt and then
                    set sail again. They hijacked the ship and made some demands, I don't remember
                    exactly what their demands were, probably the release of prisoners by Israel.
                    While they held the ship, they murdered an old man named Leon Klinghoffer, an
                    invalid in a wheelchair, who they dumped overboard. They chose Klinghoffer
                    because he was Jewish. I do remember being in the embassy on duty as we were
                    following this; I can't remember whether I was the duty officer or part of an
                    embassy task force, but I was sitting in the Ambassador's office and we were
                    trying to get news and information from the Egyptians and the Operations Center,
                    and from other embassies and so forth. In Cairo, it was really more following it
                    from afar than being able to do very much with it. It must have been October,
                    because I remember Ambassador Veliotes asking us to be sure to get the latest
                    World Series scores every time we talked to the Operations Center at State! That
                    was before the days when you could call news up on the internet or watch
                    CNN.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>In any event, the hijackers eventually cut a deal and surrendered in exchange for
                    safe passage to an Arab country, but while they were flying therto Tunis, in an
                    Egyptian plane, I thinthe plane carrying them was intercepted by American jets
                    and forced to land in Italy, where they were arrested. That strained our
                    relations with Egypt a bit. The incident also had an effect on tourism to Egypt,
                    and to the Middle East in general. The incident showed that the Middle East was
                    a little less stable, that the kinds of things you did as tourists were perhaps
                    a little less safe and a little less attractive to tourists. So, the Achille
                    Lauro was the first of several incidents that affected Egypt that way while we
                    were there.</p>
                <p>I say there was a series of these things. I'm not even sure I can remember what
                    they all were. Not long after the Achille Lauro came the downing of Pan Am
                    flight 103, which was followed by the U.S. bombing of Libya in late 1985 or
                    early 1986, I think. Then, later in 1986, the Israelis bombed the PLO (Palestine
                    Liberation Organization) headquarters in Tunis. The PLO had moved there from
                    Lebanon a couple of years earlier, after Israel invaded Lebanon. None of these
                    events were centered on Cairo, but they had their effects there. It was a time
                    of great turmoil in the Middle East. The bad atmosphere made it hard to generate
                    any movement in the peace process or on the littler issues I was dealing with.
                    And, again, it all affected tourism, which was suffering very much in Egypt
                    during the time I was there. Having all the hotels and markets empty was
                    actually a bit of an advantage for those of us living therthere were discounts
                    on Nile cruises and hotels, and the country wasn't crawling with touristbut it
                    was very hard for the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>The biggest event from the political perspective was the Egyptian police riots,
                    which happened while we were there. It was the spring of 1986. The Egyptian
                    security system at the time included a huge police force, which, like the army,
                    was staffed with conscripts. The police were second class citizens compared to
                    the army, so you had this enormous group of very young, poor, uneducated,
                    conscripted, armed policemen all over the country, carrying guns and wearing
                    black uniforms. These poor young guys would stand outside government buildings
                    and on street corners, and even in front of the American school all day. It was
                    incredibly boring and ill-paid work, in the Cairo heat and dust. At one point
                    when we were there, one of the policemen in front of the American school fell
                    asleep on his gun and shot himself by mistake. That caused an uproar among the
                    Americans and the embassy asked that the bullets be taken out of their guns. In
                    any case, if you were a better-off Egyptian, you would find a way to get into
                    the army rather than the police. So the police force was really made up from the
                    lower classes, generally not well educated, and they received very poor payment
                    and very poor conditions of service. So, in the spring of 1986, they rioted. I
                    think the riots were sparked by a rumor that the term of service for conscripts
                    in the police force was going to be extended from one year to two years.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>The riots were very dangerous for the government and for everybody. Right in
                    downtown Cairo there were gun battles in the streets. The army finally came in
                    and put the riots down but it took many hours for them to regain control. The
                    embassy went into lockdown, with armed guards everyplace. We couldn't travel
                    back to our homes because the streets weren't safe. We finally were able to get
                    back home to the suburbs late in the evening after the army organized a military
                    convoy for us, led and followed by armored vehicles. There was a curfew and the
                    streets were blocked off. Meanwhile, while we were stuck in the embassy, back in
                    the suburbs there was also fighting and rioting, right around the American
                    School. We lived only about two or three houses away from the school and my wife
                    ended up with a house full of kids who took refuge in our place rather than try
                    to get to their own houses further away. My wife went and shepherded them out of
                    the school and through the gunfire to the house. Really, it was quite an
                    experience. Things did calm down finally and got back to normal again, but it
                    took a while. I think the embassy was closed for several days, and they even
                    organized convoys to the commissary so people could buy food. Tourism never did
                    recover in my two years in Cairo. All in all, it was quite an event and perhaps
                    the biggest threat to Mubarak during all his many years in power before and
                    since.</p>
                <p>Then there was yet another terrorist incident in Cairo, targeting embassy
                    personnel, which hit very close to us. The embassy RSO (Regional Security
                    Officer), Dennis Williams, who was a very close friend and neighbor of ours, and
                    a couple of other friends were driving to work one morning down the same route
                    that we all took every day to get to work when his car was attacked by a well
                    organized group of terrorists. There were apparently two or three little groups
                    of shooters, some in a car and some on the roadside, who tried to run them off
                    the road and shoot them. Denny Williams was drivinfortunately, because as RSO he
                    had had all kinds of training in defensive driving in such situationand he was
                    able to head them off and pull the car out of danger. But, he didn't get away
                    until he himself and one of the other had been shot, each of them slightly
                    wounded in the head. Another inch or two and they would have been killed. The
                    car was a wreck, full of bullet holes. It's amazing they escaped. The incident
                    really shook up the Embassy community, of course, and led to lots more security
                    measures. It shook us up as well, since we were so close to Denny and his
                    family. It was my wife who went and got his kids out of school that day. I guess
                    we realized it could have been any of us. I passed along the same road, that
                    same morning, in a different embassy vehicle. I believe they eventually caught
                    the terrorist cell that did it, which apparently was busy planning another
                    attack on embassy personnel.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>So, there were many incidents while we were there that put the Egyptians, and the
                    international community, and us, on edge. After saying all this, I guess I
                    should add that despite all the incidents, we did generally feel safe in Cairo.
                    It was not a high crime city and in general we would walk the streets and do
                    what we wanted without any particular fear. In fact, walking around the
                    neighborhood after dark, the main thing we had to worry about were dogs. Maadi,
                    the suburb where all the embassy families lived, had lots of stray dogs which
                    would lie around quietly in the daytime, but then at night they would gather and
                    run in little packs and might attack people. So, we used to carry long bamboo
                    canes, which were actually designed to drive camels with, when we walked at
                    night, in case any hostile dogs turned up. Sometimes the problem got so bad that
                    the embassy would partner with the local police to go around and shoot the
                    dangerous strays at night. I believe the embassy supplied the ammunition and the
                    truck to pick up the carcasses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the staffing and the attitude
                        of the foreign office officials, the Egyptian ones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They were amazingly competent, amazingly good at what they did. It seemed
                    like all of them had been educated at Oxford or Cambridge. They spoke English as
                    well as we did, to the point that they could conduct negotiations in English,
                    down to the point of correcting grammar and so forth. So, they were really
                    first-class professionals. A couple of the people I dealt with from time to time
                    later ended up as foreign ministers even. It was quite something. They were all
                    friendly and accessible, because Egypt's relations with the U.S. were very good
                    at the time. But there was sometimes an undercurrent of hostility that the U.S.
                    was really siding with Israel more than Egypt, which, I guess, was true. And, a
                    lot of them had come of age during the Nasser years, so while they were
                    friendly, you could sometimes get the feeling that they were not as pro-Western
                    as their government's official policy was.</p>
                <p>Because foreign affairs and the Arab-Israeli conflict were my portfolio, I ended
                    up spending a lot of time taking notes in very high-level meetings. From the
                    Washington point of view, the most important part of our relations with Egypt
                    was ensuring that it remained in a good relationship with Israel. There were a
                    lot of meetings with President Mubarak, a lot of meetings with his foreign
                    minister, Abdel Meguid, and a lot of meetings with Boutros Ghali, who at that
                    time was deputy foreign minister. I got to know them a little and got to know
                    their staffs quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>There was an endless string of high level American visitors to Egypt, as well.
                    That kept me very busy because I was constantly appointed as control officer.
                    Since most of the official visitors to Egypt said the main reason they were
                    coming was to discuss the peace process, it always seemed to be, “Eicher, this
                    one is yours.” I actually kept track and in a two-year touabout a hundred weekI
                    was control officer fifty times, for fifty visitors or delegations! Many of
                    these visits were for the Taba negotiations, but there were lots of others,
                    tocodels and staffdels and visitors from the Department and others. I spent an
                    enormous amount of time on visitors, which had the advantage of getting me into
                    lots of high-level meetings, where the action was. But it had the disadvantage
                    of having many, many weekends taken up with visitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, how stood relations
                        between Egypt and Israel and were there any developments during your
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There was definitely a peace process, or a so-called peace process,
                    underway but it wasn't really going anyplace. It was more smoke and mirrors. I
                    came to understand the importance of having a process to point to and that it's
                    better to have something than nothing even if it's not going anyplace. If there
                    were no peace process, there would be no hope, and violence would be the only
                    alternative left open for people unhappy with the current situation. So, with
                    great fanfare, there was a lot of effort to move things forward or at least to
                    make them look like they were moving forward. At the time, much of the time I
                    was in Egypt, there was a Likud government in Israel, or a national unity
                    government including Likud, and things just weren't moving. The Israelis didn't
                    seem terribly serious about the peace process. Egypt, for its part, could have
                    done much more, as well. You know, Egypt seemed to sort of take the attitude
                    “OK, we recognized Israel, we are at peace. What more could you possibly want
                    from us? This can't be a warm relationship as long as our Arab colleagues don't
                    join in, and as long as the Israelis keep mistreating the Palestinians.” The
                    Israelis took the opposite view. They felt like they had given up Sinai for
                    peace with Egypt, but all they had gotten was a “cold peace, with no
                    friendliness or goodwill in the relationship. Often, it felt like we Americans
                    wanted a solid peace more than either of them did.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>As I said, there was this “basket” of Egypt-Israel issues that I was working on,
                    in addition to Taba, that were supposedly the sticking points in the
                    relationship. They were interesting things that were passably important but
                    which, I think, to a large extent were used as excuses by one side or the other
                    not to move forward on other things or to score political points about who was
                    being flexible. One was a monastery in Jerusalem called Deir Sultan. Actually
                    “monastery” is too strong a word. It's sort of a very small couple of structures
                    on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, really a couple of
                    rooms. It had been the property of the Egyptians Copts and, I think, after the
                    1967 War the Israelis had given it to the Ethiopian Copts, who maintained
                    possession. The Egyptians were insisting that Deir Sultan be given back to the
                    Egyptian Copts. You can imagine how useful and productive it would be for the
                    U.S. to get involved in the question of which denomination owned what portion of
                    the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. You know, this was going to go nowhere. I
                    don't know if they've resolved it yet. That whole church is a political
                    bombshell. It's supposedly built on the site where Jesus was crucified and the
                    tomb in which his body was laid. The Church is controlled by three of four
                    different denominationGreek Othodox, Armenian Orthodox and Catholic, I think.
                    They can't even agree with each other to make necessary repairs, so, for the
                    holiest site in Christendom, the church is really kind of a mess. Anyway, we had
                    a lot of discussions about that that didn't produce anything.</p>
                <p>There were a few other issues, too. One was an Israeli submarine that had sunk or
                    been sunk in Egyptian waters during one of the Egypt-Israeli wars. The Israelis
                    wanted permission to search for it so they could recover the remains of their
                    sailors; the Egyptians thought this was just an excuse for the Israelis to spy
                    in Egyptian waters around Alexandria. I think we did finally get permission for
                    a search but I can't recall if they found it. There was also a dispute over a
                    Jewish cemetery in Cairo. The Egyptians wanted to bulldoze part of it because it
                    was in the path of a highway they wanted to build; the Israeli saw this as
                    desecration. The cemetery was an incredibly run-down place, with people living
                    in it. Squatters were actually setting up housekeeping inside the rundown
                    mausoleums, as they also do in the Islamic cemeteries in Cairo. We got involved
                    in a possible solution that would have the highway built over the cemetery on
                    narrow pillars, so that the cemetery could be left largely intact. Yet another
                    issue was a few missing Israeli servicemen from the wars; the Israelis didn't
                    think the Egyptians were doing enough to try to locate and return the remains.
                    There were a couple of other issues like that, as well, but I don't recall what
                    they were. To have the Americans involved in all these little bilateral issued
                    was, I guess, a good demonstration of both how weak the bilateral relationship
                    was despite the peace treaty, and the extent to which the U.S. was up to its
                    ears in trying to make the relationship work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like, in a way, that maybe the Egyptians and the
                        Israelis both got what they wanted but their constituencies kept these
                        things going because certainly a hotel or a couple of rooms don't sound like
                        world shaking issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>EICHER: No, they shouldn't be world shaking issues. And, I think the Israelis in
                    particular were disappointed. They felt like they had already given up all of
                    the Sinai, which was important to them. There were even Israeli settlements in
                    Sinai that they had to dismantle. So, sure, they should never have been built
                    settlements in occupied territories in the first place, but the Israelis
                    believed they had really made that sacrifice for peace and were not getting a
                    real peace in return. The Egyptians, for their part, you know, they would point
                    to Sadat having been assassinated and how they had been ostracized from the Arab
                    world, so they felt they also made sacrifices for peace. On the other hand, the
                    Egyptian leadership when I was there, Mubarak, certainly didn't seem to be a
                    Sadat in terms of having a vision and of really wanting to change things and
                    have a warm, friendly peace with Israel. The attitude seemed more like “how
                    little can we do without upsetting the Americans too much?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of our presence in Egypt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: At the time I was there, Cairo was the biggest American embassy in the
                    world. That was mainly because of the enormous aid programs, both military aid
                    and civilian aid, which began after the Camp David accords. So there was a huge
                    USAID mission and a huge military assistance mission, which actually dwarfed the
                    size of the State Department portion of the Embassy. Both of those were our
                    biggest programs in the world outside of Israel. For Israel, I think our aid
                    program was mainly a question of writing checks rather than actually
                    administering programs, like in Egypt. So it was a very big, very high profile
                    kind of American presence. Essentially, the American relationship with Egypt was
                    a good relationship. The Egyptians seemed to like us, they seemed to welcome us.
                    They realized that they were getting positive things out of the relationship.
                    And, the Egyptians are very hospitable, friendly people. So, I think, all in
                    all, it was a good relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at foreign relations, what were you getting about
                        Egyptian Libyan relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was certainly not a front burner issue. Egypt's relations with Libya
                    were strained because of the peace with Israel, and maybe over other issues as
                    well, but I don't really recall any big problems at the time. I think the
                    Egyptians regarded Qaddafi as kind of a nut case, as we did. They would try to
                    explain to us how to understand the Libyans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Non-Aligned movement still in place or had that
                        gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>EICHER: It continued to exist but not in the same kind way it might have ten or
                    twenty years before, under Nasser. As we looked at Egyptian foreign-policy, it
                    could be described as sort of concentric circles. The inner circle, the most
                    important, was Egypt's place as part of the Arab world; those were the most
                    important issues to the Egyptians. The next circles were the Egyptian place as
                    part of the Islamic world and as part of Africa. Egypt was interested in African
                    affairs and played a part, but it wasn't really at the center of their foreign
                    policy. In the UN context, Egypt was part of the African group, since there is
                    no Middle East group at the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Egypt have much reach within the Arab world at that
                        time or were they still being basically boycotted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think the boycott was beginning to break down. I don' t think the Arab
                    League had moved back to Cairo yet, which had been its headquarters before. But
                    Egypt was, and still is, I guess, far and away the biggest Arab country in
                    population and economy too, I think, if you put oil aside. So I think Egypt was
                    just a country people had to deal with. The Egyptians knew they would be fully
                    reintegrated into the Arab world sooner or later; they were just too important
                    to be left out permanently. I can't remember when the Arab League moved back to
                    Egypt. But Egypt certainly was involved with the other Arab countries and with
                    the Palestinians. The Egyptians were always trying to broker a peace between the
                    U.S. and the Palestinians because, at the time, we were not yet speaking to the
                    PLO at all. The PLO was a terrorist group that, as a matter of U.S. policy, we
                    couldn't deal with. I remember many meetings at which the foreign minister was
                    trying to convince American visitors that the PLO was really very moderate and
                    giving us the names of PLO leaders that we ought to be meeting with, in
                    particular Abu Mazen, who is now President Abbas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with the Israeli Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes. I was meeting with the Israelis all the time. Since my job centered
                    on Egypt-Israel affairs, we always had things to work on together, all the
                    issues I talked about before. I got to know them all.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They were one frustrated bunch. It was a very small embassy, only three
                    or four substantive people. And, you know, they were trying to operate as a
                    normal embassy but they just did not feel like they were getting anything done.
                    And, of course, they had to be very careful about the security situation. I
                    think there were a couple of attacks on the Israeli embassy or its
                    personnel.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not in any significant way that I can remember, no. I know that we were
                    dealing with the Egyptians to support the Afghan rebels against the Soviets at
                    that time, funneling assistance through them. This was more of an intelligence
                    operation than a State Department one, so it was not something that was coming
                    across my desk as a work item, but I did hear it mentioned and it was one of the
                    types of cooperation that we were involved in with Egypt. I don't remember any
                    African operations. I remember that there were occasionally African issues I
                    would deal with since I remember going to meet the foreign ministry people who
                    dealt with Africa, but I can't remember what issues, probably Chad, if I had to
                    guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Life was wonderful. Life was really very nice. There was a very good
                    American School and nice housing, once we finally found a place. There was a
                    friendly population, wonderful things to see and do, good food, nice bazaars.
                    The kids made friends and were involved in little league and soccer teams and
                    all the kinds of activities you can have in a place with a big American
                    community. My oldest son got very involved in stagecraft at the school. He
                    graduated from high school there, in a great ceremony at the pyramids. My middle
                    son was much involved in boy scouts and used to like to go camping in the
                    desert. The kids were all involved in something called the “24 hour marathon,” a
                    very neat event at the school where teams of kidand adults, evewould run relay
                    laps for 24 consecutive hours. My wife got a job she really liked as activities
                    director at the Maadi house, the embassy recreation facility. There were lots of
                    excursions to take to the pyramids and many lesser known ancient ruins near
                    Cairo, plus mosques, and ancient Christian Cairo and sailing on the Nile and
                    other things to do. The bazaar was great; my wife would never get tired of going
                    there. There were also longer trips to the beach, to the Sinai, to upper Egypt.
                    We also went to Alexandria a few times; I was acting consul general there for a
                    few days when the CG was away. We took a trip to Israel, driving there, which
                    was very unusual at the time, with some other embassy friends. We went for
                    Christmas in 1986 and spent Christmas Eve in Bethlehem, which we found to our
                    surprise was more like Grand Central Station than like “silent night, holy
                    night.” In fact, that was the last year before the first intifadah, or
                    Palestinian uprising. After that, it was no longer possible to do that visit for
                    many years because of the unrest in the occupied territories. So, we really
                    loved life in Egypt. It is really very, very nice indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>EICHER: After that we went back to the United States again. I had been selected
                    to be the special assistant for the Middle East peace process, which sounded
                    exciting to me. The peace process didn't look as if it was really going
                    anywhere, but it was always fun to be in the middle of big political events, and
                    Arab-Israeli affairs are always right up there near the top of the U.S. foreign
                    policy agenda. I was just about to leave Cairo to go back to the States when I
                    got a call from the Department saying “Eicher, we want you to be the deputy
                    director of Egyptian affairs.” Well, that was an honor and I couldn't really say
                    no to NEA (the Bureau of Near Eastern and North African Affairs), which was now
                    my “home” bureau. But I did say that I had really been looking forward to
                    starting the peace process job. “Don't worry,” they said, “we are combining the
                    two jobs and you're going to have both jobs, so you'll wear two hats.” So, I
                    went back as the deputy director of Egyptian affairs, but the biggest part of my
                    job was to work on the Middle East peace process. So it was kind of the best of
                    both worlds. It was a very nice position. NEA/EGY (the office of Egyptian
                    affairs) was an office of five people. So, I had some supervisory duties and
                    some general and administrative issues and all the other many things that come
                    up on a country desk. But, most of each day I spent working on Middle East peace
                    process issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: From summer 1987 to summer 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The Director of Egyptian Affairs was Tezi Schaeffer for the first two
                    years and then Melinda Kimble after that. The front office was a changing
                    variety of people. There was a deputy assistant secretary (DAS) for the peace
                    process, who was Bill Kirby for most of the time I was there. There was also a
                    DAS responsible for Egypt and other countries, Ned Walker. So, depending on what
                    issue I was dealing with, I would be reporting to a different DAS, which was a
                    bit unusual. Eventually, I think the last year I was there, the two DAS
                    positions were combined, and Dan Kurtzer came in to fill the combined position.
                    The NEA Assistant Secretary for most of my tenure was Richard Murphy, who was
                    eventually replaced briefly by Ed Djerejian and then by John Kelly. So this
                    included a lot of big names who were fun to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, let's take first Egyptian affairs. Were
                        there any particular developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>EICHER: There was always a lot going on with Egypt; it was a very broad and deep
                    bilateral relationship. On the desk I got a much broader view than I did from
                    the embassy, where I had a compartmentalized portfolio. Cairo was still the
                    biggest American embassy in the world and our foreign assistance program to
                    Egypt was the second biggest in the world, after Israel. We had a wide range of
                    economic issues to deal with, an IMF program that seemed to be in trouble a lot.
                    There were many political-military issuewe were reaching an agreement for the
                    Egyptians to manufacture Abrams tanks. The Egypt desk seemed to have an
                    unusually close relationship with the embassy in Cairo, keeping them informed
                    every day of what was going on in Washington on their issues. Of course, these
                    were the same people I had been working with in Cairo on my last tour, so it was
                    easy to keep working with them. We also had a close relationship with the
                    Egyptian Embassy and worked with them a lot. There were lots of bilateral visits
                    in both directions, so we always seemed to be briefing someone. There was even a
                    state visit by President Mubarak, which was, of course, a tremendous amount of
                    work. The Mubarak visit sticks in my mind mainly because all of us on the desk
                    were invited to the White House. We didn't make the cut for the state dinner
                    itself, but, we were invited to come later to join for the after dinner
                    entertainment and dancing. It was a very elegant evening and a fun experience. I
                    remember that there were lots of people crowding around President Reagan trying
                    to shake hands or get a word with him, but Vice President Bush was wandering
                    around by himself looking a little lost, so I went and struck up a little
                    conversation with him.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I'm digressing a bit. The biggest Egyptian issue I ended up spending a
                    lot of time on while I was on the desk was Taba, which, of course, I was very
                    familiar with from having worked so much on it in Cairo. The Taba issue entered
                    a more intense level of activity after I left Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Couldn't we just turn it over to the Hilton
                        Corporation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>EICHER: It would seem to me that for the amount of time and effort we spent on
                    Taba we could've bought the darned thing ourselves. What happened was that the
                    Egyptians and Israeliwith a lot of American help and cajolinfinally agreed to an
                    international arbitration to resolve the problem. So, first, we were involved in
                    long and detailed negotiations surrounding the terms for the arbitration. The
                    State Department's legal adviser at the time was a gentleman named Abe Sofaer.
                    Judge Sofaer, as he liked to be called, took a great personal interest in the
                    Taba question and dove into it head first. Once the two sides agreed to the
                    terms of the arbitration, and the arbitration process was actually underway,
                    Sofaer's goal was to try to get them to set aside the arbitration and to agree
                    to conciliation instead. That is, conciliation would be an out-of-court
                    settlement, and the idea was that if they could agree on an out-of-court
                    settlement before the arbitration decision came in, everybody would be happier.
                    It would show that the two countries could actually work together to resolve an
                    important issue, which would build confidence to help resolve other problems,
                    thus promoting better bilateral relations and a stronger bilateral peace than if
                    one side won and one side lost. So, for most of the three years I was on the
                    desk, it seemed that I was constantly jet-setting with Judge Sofaer back and
                    forth between Washington and Cairo and Jerusalem doing these Taba negotiations,
                    which was fascinating.</p>
                <p>The negotiations themselves were interesting, with lots of legal and political
                    issues, but even more so was how they reflected the troubled relationship
                    between the two countries. Taba was a huge issue in the relationshieven more a
                    symbolic issue than a territorial onso the top people on both sides were
                    actively involved. On almost ever trip we were meeting with the Israeli prime
                    minister, Perez and then Shamir, and with Rabin, who was defense minister at the
                    time. We even had lunch with all of them together in the Israeli cabinet room
                    one tima very informal affair, with everyone stabbing pieces of chicken off a
                    big plate in the middle of the cabinet table, with no niceties like asking the
                    guests to serve themselves first. On the Egyptian side, the foreign minister was
                    heavily involved. So, through the Taba negotiations we had a very special window
                    on to the relationship and the personalities. It was fascinating to witness and
                    to be involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me get this straight. You have a peace agreement,
                        lines are drawn. All of a sudden you get this little exclusion there. I
                        would think that anybody sensible would think that essentially the Israelis
                        said, “Well, we like this and we're not going to give it up,” and that if
                        there is arbitration, it's obviously going to go to Egypt. Was that sort of
                        the feeling on our part or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>EICHER: Pretty much so, but with some nuances and lots of complications. The
                    Israelis, first of all, didn't claim that they wanted it; they claimed that, in
                    fact, it was always theirs. The location of the actual borderline was no longer
                    clearly marked after the Israelis took over the Sinai in 1967; a lot of the
                    border markers had been destroyed or removed or just disappeared over time.
                    Remember, we're only talking about a few hundred yards here and it was a few
                    hundred yards of barren beachfront that was completely undeveloped until the
                    hotel was built. There were no inhabited dwellings or any population that could
                    say “look, this is my house and it was in Egypt before the war.” So,
                    theoretically at least, there was room for dispute about exactly where the
                    border line ran. The physical descriptions of the border that were made years
                    before, when it was demarcated as the border between Egypt and British
                    Palestine, were vague enough that they could be subject to different
                    interpretations. I remember that one of the key landmarks in descriptions of the
                    border was a “rocky knoll” near the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba. But that
                    coastline has more than one rocky knoll. So even thought the preponderance of
                    the evidence seemed to be on the Egyptian side, there was room for the Israelis
                    to make a case. The Israelis also tried to inject the issue of equity into the
                    talks; that is, the judgment should take into consideration how much they had
                    improved the territory and so forth. The Egyptians totally rejected the equity
                    argument.</p>
                <p>It took us months even to negotiate the actual question to be arbitrated. If I
                    remember correctly, the final agreement on the question be arbitrated was
                    basically a victory for the Egyptians. The arbitrators were to determine “the
                    location of the pillars that marked the border between Egypt and mandated
                    Palestine.” This basically reflected the Egyptian view that the Taba issue was
                    strictly a territorial question and if you could determine where the pillars
                    were, that would resolve the problem. It was also a nice little jab at the
                    Israelis, since it didn't even mention the existence of Israel; only of British
                    Palestine. A concession to the Israelis was that the arbitration wouldn't just
                    be Taba, but it would look at the entire border, all the way from the
                    Mediterranean to the Gulf of Aqaba. It was almost all empty desert; there were
                    no fences along much of the border. As I recall, about 89 pillars had been
                    erected to mark that border; a lot of them were still standing but many had
                    disappeared. So the Egyptians and Israelis could present evidence to the
                    arbitrators in regard to all the border markers, although Taba was by far the
                    preeminent issue. It just took forever to get this agreement on the arbitration.
                    And then we went into the conciliation effort, which, I think, had some
                    attractions for both sides, at least enough to keep them seriously engaged. But
                    ultimately, neither side could bring itself to make the concessions needed for
                    conciliated agreement. It was easier for them, politically, to wait for the
                    arbitration judgment and then say “we were forced to do this,” than to come to a
                    happy agreement that involved even minor concessions.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, Israel at this time had a power-sharing government between its two
                    major parties, the Likud and Labor. For first two years of the coalition
                    government Perez was prime minister and then he rotated out for the last two
                    years and Shamir became prime minister, but always with both sides in the
                    government. It was incredible trying to deal with the Israelis under these
                    circumstances because you would meet with one set of people and they would
                    absolutely assure you that this is the Israeli position and then you would meet
                    with the other half of the government and they would tell you something totally
                    different. The Egyptians just couldn't have been more frustrated about this and
                    sometimes put it down to Israeli bad faith, but they understood the political
                    situation in Israel enough to know that it was a real problem. We were also
                    often frustrated with the inability of the Israelis to come up with a common
                    position. Sometimes, well, often, we would get the two groups of Israelis in the
                    same room togethesometimes with the Egyptians there alsand the Israeli
                    delegation then would squabble among themselves right in front of us and the
                    Egyptians and never reach a conclusion. At times it didn't seem like this was
                    going anywhere and we should just let the arbitration run its course. But,
                    Sofaer was determined to try to push the conciliation and I guess he was right
                    that if they could've agreed, then maybe it would've been better for them to
                    have an out-of-court agreement. So, anyway, it went on for a very long time. I
                    learned an awful lot about international arbitrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was running the arbitration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There was a panel of three arbitrators. Each side picked one and then
                    those two picked the third one. I can't remember their names. We went through
                    many different formulas before they agreed to this. Once they each chose their
                    arbitrator, we put together a list of three to five others for those to choose
                    from and they were finally able to agree. In the end, the arbitrators awarded
                    Taba to Egypt and the Israelis withdrew. Israel did get rulings in its favor on
                    two or three pillars elsewhere, in the middle of the desert, so they may have
                    gotten a few yards of Sinai desert here and there in exchange for Taba. It was
                    basically an Egyptian victory. The whole thing unnecessarily soured
                    Egyptian-Israeli relations for years and contributed to the “cold peace.” But,
                    with the return of Taba, the withdrawal provisions of the Camp David peace were
                    finally completed.</p>
                <p>In any case, that's what I spent a lot of my time on while I was deputy director
                    of the Egypt desk, Taba.</p>
                <p>But, I also was able to spend a lot of time on the broader Middle East peace
                    process. I was part of the small team at the Department that was trying to
                    develop strategy about how to move things forward, or at least how to make it
                    look like it was moving forward. Perception was very important. You had to have
                    a process out there that looked like it had a chance of progress, or else the
                    only alternative left was confrontation or violence.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>On the more mundane level, I spent a tremendous amount of time writing talking
                    points on the Middle East peace process because it seemed like every U.S.
                    official in every meeting in every part of the world, always had to say
                    something about the Middle East peace process and somebody had to tell him or
                    her what to say. Since events on the ground changed slightly from week to week,
                    I had this never ending job of making sure that whoever was speaking to whoever
                    had precisely the right nuances to draw upon. I also did regular wrap-up cables
                    to all diplomatic posts to be sure that our ambassadors were up to date on what
                    to say when they met with foreigners. And, whenever a foreign embassy in
                    Washington wanted a Middle East update, they would be referred to me, so I ended
                    up getting to know lots of the embassy people around Washington, plus a lot of
                    think tank people, who were always working on the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was interviewing a lady who was a speechwriter for
                        Secretary of State Christopher and she said that you had to be very careful
                        because if in a speech you put glad instead of happy or happy instead of
                        glad, this could mean something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It could. In the Middle East it was really something. You really had to
                    learn the current formulas just right or you would step in a minefield and
                    offend someone. Just as one example, if you said “the legitimate rights of the
                    Palestinians” instead of “the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people” the
                    Arabs would worry that the U.S. was taking a step backwards and no longer
                    considered the Palestinians to be “a people,” which had ramifications for their
                    claim to an independent state, whicat that poinwe didn't even recognize yet.
                    Anyway, there were a lot of little things like that, and people were always
                    getting themselves into trouble with one side or the other if they didn't stick
                    closely to my talking points.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>We did have one peace process breakthrough while I was working on the issue. We
                    finally started talking to the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). For
                    years the United States had refused to do this, since we regarded the PLO as a
                    terrorist organization. This complicated any peace negotiations, of course,
                    since you couldn't meet with or speak directly to one of the major parties to
                    the conflict. So, there was a long, careful, back channel negotiation, through
                    intermediaries, to break through this barrier. I personally was not involved in
                    this, except a little bit at the Washington end. The goal was to get Yassir
                    Arafat's agreement to renounce terrorism, in exchange for which we would open a
                    dialogue with him and include him and the PLO in the peace talks. The deal was
                    carefully negotiated. Arafat agreed to give a public speech on a set date at
                    which he would renounce terrorism. Then it was choreographed that we would make
                    our announcement of opening a dialogue with the PLO. I remember sitting there
                    together with the Middle East peace process crew, I think in the NEA assistant
                    secretary's office, listening to Arafat give his speech. CNN or somebody was
                    covering it live. He was speaking in heavily accented, broken English. When he
                    got to the crucial line, he was supposed to say “I renounce terrorism,” but he
                    actually said, quite clearly, “I denounce terrorism,” which is quite a different
                    statement. We all looked at each other and thought “oh, no, he blew it.” Then, I
                    think it was Dick Murphy, the assistant secretary who said, with a twinkle in
                    his eye, “I heard him say it.” And we all nodded our heads knowingly and agreed,
                    okay, Arafat had renounced terrorism. So we opened our discussions with the PLO,
                    finally. That actually did eventually lead to real progress and it was the start
                    of the current, sometimes erratic negotiations with the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of AIPAC (the American-Israeli
                        Political Action Committee), or other American Jewish organizations or other
                        organizations including right wing Christians from Congress or outside
                        powerful pressure groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>EICHER: Absolutely. I mean, this is just part of the landscape you had to deal
                    with. You never wanted to upset AIPAC but, generally, administration policy was
                    such that it wouldn't upset AIPAC, so it usually wasn't a problem in practice,
                    although it did limit options for creative thinking and new directions. Again,
                    the goal of the negotiations was often this idea of trying to keep something
                    going, of just pushing and pushing, partly to make it look like something was
                    happening, but also in hopes that maybe something actually would happen. It was
                    important to have something out there in the form of a negotiating process that
                    could attract people, so that violence wasn't the only answer. Of course, we
                    were also pushing for a real solution, but often it seemed that the U.S. was
                    more interested in a solution than the parties on the ground were. We had to
                    keep reminding ourselves that it wouldn't work if we wanted peace more than they
                    did. So, perhaps that's why it was called a process; it would go on and on. We'd
                    keep trying to come up with new ideas, new approaches, to keep the parties
                    engaged and to step forward, even in small ways. This sounds minimalist, but
                    over time it has worked, at least to some extent. There's now peace between
                    Israel and Jordan, as well as Egypt. The Palestinians are now actively engaged
                    in the process. All the main players now accept a Palestinian state as a goal.
                    So, the problem is far from solved; it's still a very dangerous place; but, you
                    can see some progress in small steps, over time, and this is a result of keeping
                    a process going.</p>
                <p>I want to mention one trip out to the region with Secretary George Schultz which
                    was tremendously interesting to me. Usually, I would not accompany the secretary
                    on his travels. But, this time Dennis Ross was on leave because his wife was
                    having a baby and they asked me if I would go on the trip instead, which I
                    happily did. Ross later spent years as the special envoy for Middle East
                    negotiations, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, but at the
                    time I was working on the issue Ross was first on the Secretary's policy
                    planning staff working on the Middle East, and then at the NSC (National
                    Security Council). Anyway, I hopped on the secretary's planwhich was an
                    interesting experience in itseland started with him on a Middle East mission. It
                    was Easter time and we went first to Rome. I guess he liked to stop at the
                    Vatican at Easter time. We had an audience with the Pope, John Paul II, who
                    blessed our mission. That was quite a treat; in addition to the audience, we got
                    an inside tour of the Vatican which took us to places not open to the public.
                    Then we flew out to Israel. As we neared Israel, we were escorted by a bunch of
                    Israeli fighter jets, which flew in formation just a few feet off our wing tips
                    on each side, dangerously close, I thought; they were really hot-dogging.
                    Anyway, it was Easter day and in the morning we were in Rome and in the evening
                    we were in Jerusalem, which was quite a memorable Easter.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Then, we had a very intense couple of days of meetings in the region. I was
                    supposed to stay in Jerusalem with most of the delegation while Shultz went on
                    with a very small team to Jordan and Syria, but late the night before his
                    departure they decided to include me in that part of the trip, in the place of
                    someone else who suddenly had to stay in Israel. That was great, except that
                    they forgot to inform me about it! So, early the next morning I was still
                    peacefully sawing wood in my hotel room when I was woken up by a call to say I
                    had missed the motorcade and had better get myself in gear since the plane was
                    due to depart in half an hour. It seemed impossible, since it would take longer
                    than that to get to the airport. But I rushed like crazy and they had a car
                    waiting for me which broke all the speed records down the windy road from
                    Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and I stumbled on to the plane just before they closed the
                    door.</p>
                <p>I'm glad I made it because it turned out to be one of my most memorable Foreign
                    Service trips, to Amman and Damascus in one day, to meet with King Hussein and
                    President Hafez al-Assad. There was a striking contrast in the two capitals.
                    King Hussein was the urbane, friendly, polished Western-style king in his
                    beautiful palace, which is really just a very nice, large house. There was even
                    a tricycle out in the driveway. We sat around his elegant living room, which was
                    light and airy and wonderfully decorated with beautiful rugs and talked about
                    how to promote the peace process. He gave us a wonderful lunch right there in
                    the house, many courses; I remember that he was served something different, and
                    much lighter, than the rest of us. Then we were off to Damascus where we
                    received by President Assad in a joyless, windowless, undecorated room with
                    Assad sitting in a sort of throne at the head of the room and the U.S.
                    delegation sitting in rank order in easy chairs all the way down one side of the
                    room and the Syrian delegation in rank order all the way down the other side of
                    the room. The atmosphere was very formal and grim, in stark contrast to Amman.
                    The embassy warned us that Assad meetings usually last hours; it's not unusual
                    for them to last five hours or more. They warned us that they'll start serving
                    you tea and coffee and juice as soon as you sit down, so be moderate in what you
                    take because you can't get up and leave the room unobtrusively the way it is set
                    up. The meeting was all done with consecutive interpretation, although Assad
                    clearly spoke English, since he kept correcting the interpreters. After about
                    two hours it was clear we had said all we needed to say and heard all we needed
                    to hear, so the secretary edged up to the end of his chair, buttoned his jacket
                    and was clearly getting ready to go. The whole American side of the room, you
                    know, followed suit and we were all sitting up on the edge of our chairs ready
                    to go. Assad looked a Shultz and said, “You Americans are always in such a
                    hurry. Where are you going that's so much more important?” So, Shultz said, “I'm
                    not going anywhere,” and settled back down in his seat, and the rest of us also
                    sat back down. The meeting continued for another hour or hour and a half. We
                    finally got up and left after about three hours or so, a little over three
                    hours, and the embassy people told us it was one of the shortest meetings ever
                    with President Assad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a plan? I mean there was one time when Schultz
                        came out with a plan that Assad shot down.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>EICHER: We must've had some kind of plan that we were presenting, but I can't
                    remember specifically what it was. It's interesting because I was just thinking,
                    what was the substance of this trip? And I cannot really remember; I'll have to
                    try and go back and see if I still have notes from that era. If there was a plan
                    I don't think it was ever one that we really expected to be the great Middle
                    East breakthrough. It was more of a holding operation. I think it would be fair
                    to say we had an approach rather than a plan. During my years the approach was
                    usually to try to encourage confidence-building measures on both sides, before
                    trying to tackle the much more difficult “final status issues.” So, we were
                    leaning on the Israelis to do things like rein in settlements and on the Arabs
                    to take steps to begin dialogue with Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time that you were dealing with this process,
                        were the Israelis on a fairly aggressive path of changing the geography, as
                        far as putting in settlements? In a way, it seemed like every time we
                        negotiate the Israelis are simply gobbling up territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was happening then, as well, and it was certainly an impediment to the
                    peace process then as it is now. Absolutely. There were lots of impediments to
                    the process. In fact, the first intifada started soon after I began working on
                    the peace process; I think it was in the fall of 1987. I was actually in Israel
                    at the time with Judge Sofaer. We had hoped to go to visit Bethlehem on a
                    Saturday morning but then we were told that there was some rioting near there
                    and so we probably shouldn't go, and we didn't. Well, in fact, there was rioting
                    and it spread and became the beginning of the first intifada. After that, it
                    became much more difficult to visit the territories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was described as sort of the children's intifada, I
                        mean with rocks. You know, it was spontaneous and difficult for the Israelis
                        to deal with because these were kids.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Certainly a lot of them were kids but I think there were also plenty of
                    adults. The unrest took off and spread and lasted quite some time. Eventually,
                    it calmed down but then started up again later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for any Jewish influence in this
                        whole process? We obviously have a significant Jewish element in the State
                        Department and in the government. Sofaer sounds as though it might be a
                        Jewish name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: He was certainly Jewish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this ever play as a factor? How did this go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, it was no secret and it was part of the general background, but it
                    was not something that anyone seemed much concerned with. U.S. policy was so
                    pro-Israeli that the overall image was the same, whether the actors of the
                    moment were Jews or Christians. As far as I know, we didn't have any American
                    Muslims working on the peace process, or even in the State Department. Sofaer,
                    was an example of a Jew who, I think, was if anything harder on the Israelis
                    than on the Egyptians. One of the people who I worked closely with, Dan Kurtzer,
                    was an Orthodox Jew who ended up being named ambassador to Egypt and then to
                    Israel; he was a wonderful guy, well respected all around. So, no, I don't think
                    that was a problem in practice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't seen as a bias factor or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The Egyptians and Arabs probably saw it that wasometimes, at leasbut from
                    the U.S. point of view, I don't think there was a bias among the State
                    Department people I worked with. Where you saw the bias was among the think
                    tanks and non-government groups, like AIPAC and others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sense of exasperation among policy-makers
                        about the settlement process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think there clearly was but I'm not sure it went beyond exasperation
                    into effective action. Although we talked with the Israelis about ending
                    settlements, I couldn't help thinking that the U.S. really needed to get tougher
                    on Israel on this point in particular, which was clearly impeding the peace
                    process and complicating a long-term settlement. On the other hand, you didn't
                    necessarily get the sense of great Arab sincerity either. You never really got
                    the feeling that if you got tough on Israel and finally got them to do “A” or
                    “B” that the Arabs would accept it as a positive step and reciprocate. It was
                    more a feeling that the Arabs would just pocket any Israeli concession and then
                    make their next demand. That's why we were trying to get reciprocal
                    confidence-building measures. But sometimes, often even, it seemed as if neither
                    side was really in a sincere peacemaking mode themselves. So what we were doing
                    was very much a holding operation, trying at least to make sure things didn't
                    get worse and, to the extent possible to press for small steps forward.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>You know, I learned a lot from the experience. First, as I've said, you can't be
                    successful with a peace settlement if you want it more than the parties to the
                    conflict do. We Americans were constantly in danger of that, in danger of
                    over-reaching. We had to keep explicitly reminding ourselves that we seemed to
                    want it more than they did and to be careful that our own hopes and desires
                    didn't get too far out in front of reality, since that could set us up for a big
                    failure which could really set back the process. Second, I saw how different the
                    American mindset is from the Middle Eastern mindset, and the mindset in much of
                    the rest of the world. Americans see a problem and our reaction is “well, let's
                    solve it,” and let's do so as quickly as possible. For much of the rest of the
                    world there is not much expectation of “solving” problems. For them, the problem
                    is often seen as a fact of life. In many cases the problem has been around for
                    centuries and they think it will probably be around for centuries more. Maybe it
                    will be solved some day and maybe not. The mindset isn't to “solve” a problem,
                    but to manage it, or find a way to live with it, or maybe to make some
                    improvements around the edges. That's not to say that problems can't be solved,
                    but that we Americans often go in with expectations that are too high and that
                    our first challenge is often convincing people that a solution is even
                    theoretically possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Arab world. I know I was in Saudi Arabia
                        one time back in the 50s. The Saudis could've helped the Palestinians
                        significantly but in many ways keeping the Palestinian cause going without
                        finding a solution represented, as I think it does even today, a source of
                        unity for a very disparate Arab world which gives them something to focus
                        on. You solve that and then you're left with all the sorts of other
                        squabbles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think there's something to be said for that. Look at things like the
                    refugee problem. There are still Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria
                    50 or 60 years after they left, despite the Arab oil wealth. These people could
                    have been helped enough to get them out of camps and give them a decent life. I
                    think there has clearly been a political purpose to be served by keeping them in
                    refugee camps, and the result has been generations of increasingly radical,
                    disaffected Palestinians.</p>

                        about.</hi>

                <p>EICHER: I produced a book, yes.</p>
                <p>But first, since you mentioned the Gulf War, let me just divert to that for a
                    moment and then we can talk about the Cox Fellowship next time.</p>
                <p>Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait within a couple of weeks after I began my Cox
                    Fellowship. I was going to do some historical research on early American
                    diplomats and I had gotten myself a little office in Annapolia beautiful little
                    office right downtown with a fireplace and balcony overlooking the Annapolis
                    Harboand I started work. No sooner had I settled into this new life, than the
                    invasion of Kuwait took place. So there were all of my friends in NEA, who I had
                    been so close to and worked together with for years, suddenly involved in the
                    most important, pressing issue of U.S. foreign policy. It was the big news, all
                    you could read about all over the front pages. And there was Eicher, out in the
                    boonies someplace, away from it all. And as much as I was pleased to be having a
                    year off, I couldn't help feeling just a little sorry for myself and thinking
                    that “darn, just as things get exciting I'm gone and everybody has forgotten
                    about me.”</p>
                <p>But, of course, it didn't turn out that way. The telephone rang and it was NEA
                    calling to ask, would I be available to leave tomorrow on a trip to the Middle
                    East? This really picked up my spirits; I hadn't been forgotten after all. I
                    told them, “why, yes, of course,” as if I were always packing up on a day's
                    notice to go to the Middle East, which, in fact, was not so different from what
                    I had been doing for the past three years. My wife was less than delighted that
                    I was suddenly heading for a war zone instead of whiling away the hours at my
                    new office in Annapolis. But, I think she was less surprised than I was that the
                    call came in.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>It turned out that Assistant Secretary John Kelly was going on a mission and he
                    wanted to take somebody with him who he knew and trusted. But, everybody in NEA
                    was so busy with what was going on that it would have been disruptive to the
                    Bureau to take one of the regular officers. So, it worked out wonderfully for
                    me. I flew out with Kelly and a staff assistant to Europe, where we caught a
                    private military jet to the Middle East. The main purpose of the trip was, first
                    of all, to meet with the emir of Kuwait, who was now in exile in Dhahran, Saudi
                    Arabia, to ask him whether he wanted U.S. help in getting his country back. This
                    was the first official meetinat least the first high level onwith the Emir since
                    he was forced into exile. It was a very somber meeting, of course. There was a
                    big group of Kuwaiti nobles there, all looking very grim and with tales of the
                    outrages Saddam had committed. The Emir spoke marginal English and stayed for a
                    while, then left the meeting to his brother, who was, I think, the foreign
                    minister. In response to our main question, they very much wanted U.S.
                    assistance to oust Saddam from Kuwait. Our second question to the Emir was
                    whether he would be willing to pay for the cost of a war to oust Saddam, and he
                    said he would. We got all this in writing from him. I think we even took out a
                    draft letter setting out what he needed to say. So, in a way this was a very
                    historic meeting; it set the stage for U.S. intervention and provided the
                    groundwork for President Bush's (the first President Bush's) statement that the
                    Iraqi invasion of Kuwait “will not stand.” Soon afterwards, the U.S. launched
                    “Desert Shield,” the military build-up to protect Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
                    countries and to prepare for taking Kuwait back.</p>
                <p>I should say also, as an aside, that this was my first trip back to Dhahran,
                    where I was born, since I had left there when I was about one year old.
                    Unfortunately, we didn't have time to see the sightif there are any sights in
                    Dhahrasince we were whisked from the airport to the fancy meeting hall where we
                    met the Emir and then back again. But I did see the city from the air, from our
                    little private jet, and did see a bit out the car windows as we drove along. It
                    was not at all what I imagined. My parents always talked about Dhahran as a
                    little oil camp in the desert, but here was a real, good-sized city. It had been
                    about 40 years since I was born, so I guess there were a lot of changes.</p>
                <p>The rest of the trip with Kelly was aimed at building an Arab coalition to stand
                    with us against the invasion. This was a key element of the broader coalition
                    against Saddam that would be put into place. Getting Arab support would be
                    critical to the success of U.S. policy. Looking back now, there was such an
                    enormous contrast from the careful effort we made then to get international
                    support and participation for the effort to liberate Kuwait, and President Bush
                    II's go-it-alone, “you're with us or you're against us” approach to the second
                    Gulf War ten years later.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>In Saudi Arabia, Kelly and I met with the foreign minister in Jeddah, who was
                    also supportive. We then went on to Egypt and Syria, which also got on board.
                    This was important stuff, and not to be taken for granted. Even though Saddam
                    was not well liked by the Egyptians or Syrians, going to war against him was not
                    an easy step; it was not at all a foregone conclusion that they would step in.
                    We met a lot of very high level people. I can't remember if we also visited
                    Jordan or not, but I do remember that we avoided Israel, because we didn't want
                    to risk giving the Arabs a reason to say no, by making it look like they would
                    be part of a coalition with Israel against another Arab country. So, it was a
                    very interesting trip for ten days or so. I was right in the thick of it, in
                    some of the most important meetings of the pre-war period. I was satisfied.
                    Nobody had forgotten me and I had been in on the action, more so, in fact, than
                    if I were still on the desk. After that trip, I went back to my sabbatical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this trip that you made with Assistant Secretary Kelly,
                        was it pretty well determined that we were going in or was this sort of
                        preliminary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was not yet fully decided. Nobody had met with the emir yet. I think
                    the inclination was certainly to go in, given the nature of our mission. We were
                    certainly prepared to go in if we got kind of responses we expected to get.
                    Immediately after meeting the emir we started building the coalition. But, I'm
                    not sure what the approach would have been if the emir had said no, or had put
                    us off for some reason. Or, I'm not sure how we would have proceeded if all the
                    Arabespecially the Saudis, but also the Egyptians and Syrianhad said no. We
                    couldn't have done the Desert Shield build-up without Saudi support. So, while
                    the direction of U.S. policy was pretty clear, the outcome was less certain.</p>
                <p>After this very interesting experience with Kelly, I went back to my Cox
                    Fellowship in my little office in Annapolis to continue my research. But my
                    fellowship was interrupted once more by the Middle East. In a way, it was sort
                    of a repeat of the experience I just described. The trip with Kelly was in
                    August or September of 1990. That was followed by a long and slow military
                    build-up in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries. In January of 1991, I think
                    it was, Desert Storm finally began. It started with an extended bombing campaign
                    against Iraq, in preparation for the invasion of Kuwait. So, once again, the
                    Middle East was all over the front pages and there I was still off in my nice
                    little office in Annapolis, overlooking the harbor. And once again, as much as I
                    was enjoying my research, I was thinking once again about all the great events
                    going on in the world and that I was sidelined; everybody had forgotten Peter
                    Eicher. Then the telephone rang again. It was, of course, the Department saying,
                    “you know, there's a war on and we'd like you to come back and join us for a
                    little while. We want you to be one of the coordinators of the task force for
                    the Gulf War.” I couldn't really say no to thain fact, if I'm honest, I'm not
                    sure I even wanted to say nand I agreed to go back. I ended up spending about
                    six weeks doing shift work in the Operations Center, heading various shifts of
                    the task force.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the war still ongoing when you came back to work on
                        the task force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The war had just actually started. That is, you'll recall that during the
                    first Gulf War, there was this long period of bombing Iraq that took place
                    before the actual invasion. I don't remember exactly how long it went on, but
                    that is what was going on when I went to the task force. You'll remember all
                    those CNN shots from Baghdad of the bombs coming down. The bombing was the
                    beginning of Desert Storm. That's when CNN really became a worldwide force for
                    the first time. A lot of what we did in the Operations Center was watching CNN
                    to figure out what was going on. We would get news more quickly from the TV than
                    from our embassies. I think this was starting to mark a very significant change
                    in what diplomatic reporting could be and should be, which I would write about
                    in my book. It was no longer possible for diplomats to beat the news broadcasts.
                    Diplomatic reporting would increasingly have to be about analysis and reporting
                    on private meetings and contacts, and less on quick reporting of events. The war
                    was a very short war, as you'll remember, but we did have the task force going
                    for quite a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the crucial things about this whole Gulf War seemed
                        to have been, and I got this, obviously, from others who had served in
                        regular positions, that there was no real plan on how to end the war.
                        General Schwarzkopf essentially ended up making key decisions in a tent out
                        in the middle of the desert. That's where I see it. Was there any talk in
                        your group I mean, obviously you weren't in the policy group, but did there
                        seem to be a policy on ending the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We certainly talked about it and there was speculation but I don't think
                    we knew any more than anybody else did. In fact, it was a surprisingly sleepy
                    task force. Once the war started, the real activity was presumably over at the
                    Pentagon and the White House rather than in the State Department. It was quiet
                    even compared to some of the African coup task forces that I had served on. We
                    did have action items, of course, and we had to be on top of developments and do
                    regular situation reports and so forth, but we were not really in the middle of
                    things. I was one of four coordinators, I think. Each of us had a team of about
                    five or six, including a consular officer, an analyst, a military liaison and
                    one or two others. We worked rotating eight hour shifts, that is, for two days
                    we'd work 8:00 to 4:00, then two days 4:00 to midnight, then two days midnight
                    to 8:00, then off for two or three days. It's pretty disruptive to your sleep
                    patterns. On the positive side, the next shift always came in on time to relieve
                    you; this may have been the only State Department job I ever had where I really
                    worked only eight hours a day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, the lack of a plan to end the war highlights the
                        problem of calling the Pentagon the war-makers and the State Department the
                        peacemakers. This is a tremendous oversimplification but at the same time,
                        if you've got a war, you've got to have a peace.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>EICHER: I think that's right. Certainly my view, and I think the view of the
                    preponderance of the people I was working with, did not think it was a mistake
                    to stop the war when we did. I mean, we had achieved our war goal, as it had
                    been announced. Iraq had been removed from Kuwait. I don't recall anybody,
                    certainly not myself, thinking that we should take advantage of this and move on
                    to Baghdad and change the regime. Those kind of thoughts really moved to the
                    fore later, when Saddam started being a problem again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm thinking even less of moving arms and doing that but
                        to figure out what we wanted to see. Apparently, we left Saddam with enough
                        tools to re-impose a brutal regime, particularly on dissident groups. We're
                        living with the consequences now. I don't want to put words in your mouth
                        but was there the feeling that, you know, after this defeat, Saddam is not
                        going to last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think that was probably everybody's general impression. He had lost
                    face; he had lost the so-called “mother of all battles.” His army had been
                    pretty much destroyed, at least to the extent that it didn't pose a threat to
                    any other country. There was a lot of devastation in Iraq as a result of the
                    bombing. It seemed that sensible people would oust him and find somebody more
                    reasonable. So I think the expectation was that he would be ousted or at least
                    would he be back in his box where he couldn't cause any more trouble. But if
                    there was any actual planning to that effect, I'm not aware of it. In fact, in
                    terms of postwar planning in general, I never saw anything or heard talk of any
                    plans at all, except with regard to Kuwait, where people were focusing on
                    putting out oil well fires and things of that nature. In the task force,
                    however, I was not in a position where I necessarily would have been seeing such
                    plans, if they existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's cover Cox grants. Could you explain the genesis of
                        Cox grants, what it was and then what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, the Cox Foundation gives a grant every yeasome years two grantto a
                    Foreign Service officer to pursue a project. I wasn't really very familiar with
                    Cox grants when I applied for one. The story is that Una Chapman Cox, a wealthy
                    oil heiress, sailed her yacht into India, at some point, and was promptly
                    arrested and put in jail for not having the proper papers, illegal entry. She
                    was so impressed with the work of the consular officer who got her released that
                    she decided to leave part of her fortune to do good things for the Foreign
                    Service. The result was the Cox Foundation, which has a number of programs to
                    benefit the Service. Their premier grant, however, is the annual Cox Fellowship.
                    It's supposed to be given to a deserving FSO (Foreign Service Officer) based on
                    his or her having done a good job in the past.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>As I said, I wasn't really familiar with the fellowship program at the time, but
                    I saw a Department notice about it and it looked interesting. At that time, the
                    Cox grant was accepted as one of the six bids everyone was required to submit
                    for their onward assignment. The list of assignment possibilities that year was
                    not very attractive to me and there were not six positions that I really wanted
                    to bid on, so I put in for a Cox grant in order to fill up my bid list. As part
                    of the bid I had to present a project proposal. I had always been interested in
                    diplomatic history and so I put forth a proposal that if I were chosen, I would
                    like to do some historical research and writing on early American diplomats. I
                    spent two or three hours down in the State Department library doing a little
                    background research to be able to give a number of examples of the kinds of
                    things I would like to do. Then, I pretty much set it aside. It was not high on
                    my bid list. What I was really hoping to do that year was to go to teach at the
                    Naval Academy. There had traditionally been a State Department teaching slot at
                    the Naval Academy and the other military academies. I lived in Crofton,
                    Maryland, very close to Annapolis. It would have been convenient. My dad had
                    just died and my mom was there and it would have been a chance to spend more
                    time and help her out. I had been in very high powered jobs, high intensity
                    jobs, for the past few years and hadn't seen much of the family. So the Naval
                    Academy seemed to be a nice idea. Unfortunately, although the Naval Academy slot
                    was on the bid list, they discontinued the position starting that year, so it
                    really wasn't available, after all.</p>
                <p>I was actually quite surprised when the Department came back and offered me the
                    Cox Fellowship. I had to admit to the person who offered it to me that, you
                    know, I wasn't very familiar with it and I was really hoping for something else.
                    He told me, “Wait a minute. You don't want to turn this down. This is the
                    Department's best sabbatical program. It's much better than your other bids. You
                    need to look very carefully at this.” He explained that they would give me a
                    grant of twenty five or thirty thousand dollars, in addition to my salary, to
                    pursue the project of my design and that funding could also be used for travel
                    for myself and my spouse. So I looked into it a bit more and found that he was
                    right, this was a great program. So I accepted the fellowship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you already designed a project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>EICHER: Only to the extent that I have described it to you. I had spent two or
                    three hours in the library and decided it would be nice to do some historical
                    research. I always enjoyed libraries and history, especially diplomatic history
                    and doing research. My very brief project proposal said I would research and
                    write about early American diplomats. There was no requirement to produce a book
                    and I didn't necessarily want to be tied down to that, so I said I'd do
                    articles, thinking that these might become a book, or maybe not. As I said, I
                    had no idea there would be this huge grant or that you'd be able to travel or
                    use it for other things. As it turned out, however, with the Gulf War starting
                    soon after I got my grant, the State Department was issuing advisories not to
                    travel almost any place, literally, so I wasn't really able to take advantage of
                    the travel possibilities that some Cox grantees have had. So, I rented a little
                    office in Annapolis and got myself a computemy very first computer, a MAC, and I
                    had to learn how to use it; I didn't even know how to use a mouse! In those days
                    the State Department was still using WANG word processors. My kids had to teach
                    me to use a computer. I was able to make an arrangement with the Naval Academy
                    to use their library, which was very good and convenient for my purposenaval
                    history overlaps tremendously with diplomatic history. I also got one of the
                    little cubicles in the State Department Library assigned to me and I started
                    spending time in the Library of Congress and at the National Archives. As my
                    first project, I researched and wrote a story on William Palfry, who had always
                    intrigued me because he is the first person on “the plaque.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might mention what the plaque is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The plaque is the big black, marble plaque you can see as you walk into
                    the main lobby of the State Department. There are two now: the one on the left
                    as you walk in is inscribed to people who have died in tragic or heroic
                    circumstances in the line of duty. Once that plaque filled up, they started
                    another plaque on the opposite side of the lobby. I believe that now pretty much
                    anyone who dies in the line of duty has their name put on the plaque, including
                    even some people who are not State Department. The new plaque gives only the
                    name and the year of death, but the old plaque also includes a few words about
                    how each person died, “yellow fever,” or “earthquake,” or “drowned saving life.”
                    The old plaque is little erratic and doesn't really include everyone it should.
                    The first entry on the plaque is “William Palfry, Lost at Sea, 1780.” He was to
                    be the first consul in Paris, in fact, the first U.S. consul anywhere. He was on
                    his way to join Ben Franklin but his ship disappeared en route, with no
                    survivors.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>As I was doing the research on Palfrey and started on the next one, I kept coming
                    across these wonderful, historic, early dispatches from American diplomats,
                    describing events at their posts. It occurred to me that we have had people
                    assigned in other countries of the world for the last 200 plus years, all
                    writing home to the State Department about all the politically interesting
                    events of world history. This is a marvelous collection buried away in dusty
                    archives. Why not try to uncover some of it? In fact, I decided, it might be a
                    lot more fun to put together a collection of those. So, I got in touch with the
                    Cox people and asked them if it would be all right if I changed my project and
                    they said fine, fine. They were extremely relaxed about it. The Cox philosophy,
                    in fact, was that the grant was supposed to be reward for a Foreign Service
                    officer who was doing good work rather than a requirement to produce anything.
                    It was the State Department, which was still paying your salary, that insisted
                    you produce something useful as part of your fellowship, although State was also
                    pretty relaxed and didn't seem to care much exactly what you produced. There
                    was, for example, no requirement to publish anything. In any case, neither Cox
                    nor State objected to my idea, so I changed my project and began to put together
                    a collection of dispatches.</p>
                <p>The time I had available was pretty constrained since a couple months had gone by
                    before I shifted projects and since was I called back to active duty twice, for
                    the Gulf War, during the course of the sabbatical. Still, I managed to put
                    together a pretty good collection that I thought might be publishable and I left
                    it with ADST (the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training) to see if
                    they might want to do something with it. They had an agent at that time who
                    looked at it and decided it was not really a publishable work. It was two or
                    three hundred dispatches, each with a short introduction putting it into
                    historical context. The manuscript was probably a thousand typewritten pages or
                    so. I left a copy with ADST and I kept a copy and figured I would do some more
                    work on it later and eventually I might turn it into something that could be
                    published.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, just to complete the story, several years later a new president of
                    ADST, Steve Lowho I had worked for when he was Ambassador to Nigerifound my
                    manuscript on the shelf of his office and liked it very much. ADST was about to
                    start its own publishing program and had hired its own publishing adviser. They
                    asked me if I wanted to do some more work to make it publishable and I agreed. I
                    spent quite a long time adding to it and refining it and including a little more
                    historical background. It finally came out as a book in 1997, I believe.</p>

                <p>EICHER: “Emperor Dead” is the entire text of the dispatch sent in by our envoy in
                    St. Petersburg when Czar Alexander II was assassinated. Just two words. It was a
                    time when telegrams were just starting to be used and our diplomats were
                    instructed to use extreme brevity in telegrams because they were so expensive
                    and they were charged by the word. So, our envoy sent just a two word dispatch
                    to describe a momentous event, and followed this up with a formal, hand written
                    dispatch which contained much more information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about finding these dispatches? The
                        archives must be loaded with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They are loaded with them. Fortunately, most of the State Department
                    dispatches have been put on microfilm and organized by post and chronologically
                    within posts, which makes it easier, much easier, to locate things. On the other
                    hand, there are enormous numbers of dispatches and the microfilms aren't all of
                    terribly good quality. And, until about 1900, all dispatches were hand written;
                    typewriters were not used until the twentieth century. Some diplomats had
                    beautiful handwriting, but many did not. The microfilms are basically
                    transparencies of the hand written originals and slogging through them is
                    difficult and time consuming.</p>
                <p>I tried to do a variety of things that I thought would make for an interesting
                    and worthwhile collection. In the first place, I wanted to include interesting
                    and historically significant events. So, I started with the very first American
                    diplomatic dispatch ever sent, which was from Silas Deane in Paris. Then I moved
                    on to the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars and later events. I went
                    looking for some specific eventthe execution of Louis XVI, Waterloo and the
                    Louisiana purchase, for exampland stumbled on others like the recruiting of the
                    Marquis de Lafayette, or reports of pirate depredations in various places. I
                    made myself a long list of interesting historical events to check out. Many of
                    them did have interesting reports, but many did not. For example, I went looking
                    to see if we had anybody in Indonesia when Krakatau erupted and sure enough, we
                    had a consul in Batavia who gave a fascinating description the disaster. I found
                    reports on the discovery of the source of the Nile, the Indian Mutiny, the
                    Alaska gold rush, the Armenian genocide, the rise of Hitler, you know, as many
                    interesting things as I could think of. I tried hard to get geographic balance,
                    so I included the first dispatch from China and some reports of the Latin
                    American wars of independence. In trying to get balance, I also read randomly
                    the dispatches from some countries that were not otherwise included, which
                    allowed me to stumble on some of the nicest dispatches that I found. For
                    example, I didn't have anything from Siam or Korea so I started reading through
                    those and found a wonderful description of the royal elephant hunt in Siam and
                    of grave-robbing in Korea. There were lots of fun, quirky reports, like
                    supposedly finding the arms of the Venus de Milo, and of an early consul in
                    Texas having his horses stolen by Indians.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>So, I went through history and read thousands of dispatches, and selected what I
                    thought were the most interesting or historically significant. I made kind of an
                    arbitrary stop in the early 1960s because the collection was getting very long
                    and my time was running out, and also because of the number of dispatches each
                    year was multiplying beyond all control and mainly because the declassification
                    process had only gone up to the early '60s at that stage.</p>
                <p>In addition to events, I tried to include dispatches written by famous people who
                    have served as American diplomats. Quite a few of our early presidents served as
                    diplomats, so I wanted to include at least one dispatch from each of them. A lot
                    of well-known authors also served as diplomats: Nathaniel Hawthorne, Washington
                    Irving, James Russell Lowell, so I got at least one from each of those who I
                    could find. I also included other personalities that are a bit less well known
                    but still significant: Mirabeau Lamar, who was one of the presidents of Texas
                    when it was independent, and Thomas Nast, who was America's leading political
                    cartoonist, who originated the elephant and donkey symbols for the Republicans
                    and Democrats. Often the dispatches from well-known people were not particularly
                    noteworthy, but occasionally I hit the jackpot, for example with Thomas
                    Jefferson's description of the storming of the Bastille and John Quincy Adams's
                    report on Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just out of curiosity, where was your office in
                        Annapolis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was right at the city dock, the well-known Market Square. If you go to
                    Market Square and look at the buildings, there is only one building that has a
                    small balcony; it's on the first floor above ground level, and that was the
                    balcony of my office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I lived in Annapolis as a teenager so I used to go down to
                        the market place there and I knew that area very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, it was wonderful. There was also a little fireplace in the office,
                    which gave it a nice feeling, although I never lit a fire. It was just a
                    one-room office. Nonetheless, it was very nice.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I had first thought, as I told you, that I was going to be writing about early
                    American diplomats. Originally, I had visions of traveling to the places where
                    the diplomats served, for example, maybe to Greece, as part of my research into
                    somebody who served in Crete, to pick up some local color and history and so
                    forth. As it turned out, I got only as far my second story of a particular
                    diplomat, a fellow named Daniel Clark who was our consul in New Orleans before
                    it became American. I took just one little trip to New Orleans, which, as I
                    said, was permitted, and under the Cox rules I was allowed to take my wife along
                    as well, so we a very nice long weekend in New Orleans, which I had never
                    visited before. We managed to find Daniel Clark's grave in an old cemetery there
                    and I found that the historical society there had a couple of papers of Daniel
                    Clark's that had not been available in Washington. I had really hoped to be
                    doing more of that kind of traveling, but as things developed, it didn't work
                    out.</p>
                <p>I should also mention that I had a couple of research assistants who helped me
                    out in gathering information for part of the sabbatical. I advertised both at
                    the Naval Academy and at St. John's University and hired a couple of students
                    part-time, one of whom didn't produce very much or last long, but another one
                    who was quite good and helpful. I would task him to go to the archives and look
                    through Egypt or Brazil or whatever, and see what he could find, or to try to
                    find some specific historic events. So this was helpful and enabled me to cover
                    more than I could have done by myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, getting back to the real world, by the way, right
                        now the book is out of print, but we're hoping you can work it somehow so
                        that we can have it printed again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I hope so, that would be very nice. Marjorie Thompson is working on
                    this, so we'll see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You finished this when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I finished the sabbatical in June of 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Then I moved on to what had been my dream job over very many years. I
                    became political counselor in Geneva. That was the U.S. Mission to the United
                    Nations in Geneva. You may recall I had previously served a tour in the
                    Department's office of United Nations political affairs, so I had some
                    experience on the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>EICHER: I was in Geneva from 1991 to 1995.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Could you explain what the job consisted of and
                        then we'll talk about what happened while you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The job was quite diverse and interesting. Geneva is the headquarters of
                    many United Nations agencies and other international organizations. The
                    political counselor's title was actually “Counselor for Political and
                    Specialized Agency Affairs.” I had a variety of different organizations and
                    issues to deal with. The main issue by far was human rights. The UN Human Rights
                    Commission was based in Geneva, which was a highly political and very active
                    body. There were also several UN human rights treaty bodies based there and what
                    was then the UN Center for Human Rights, which later became the Office of the
                    High Commissioner for Human Rights. But my section was also responsible for the
                    World Health Organization, the International Labor Organization, the
                    International Telecommunication Union and the International Committee of the Red
                    Cross, as well as helping out generally on any political negotiations which
                    might be going on in Geneva. There were always some kind of international
                    political talks going on in Geneva. While I was there, the principal one was the
                    Yugoslavia peace negotiations, which started while I was in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador or did you have several?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I had two and they were both political appointees. The first was Morris
                    Abrams, who was a very distinguished, quite well-known, elderly lawyer. He used
                    to tell stories that he had been one of the young attorneys at the Nuremberg
                    trials. He had also been a civil rights lawyer in the United States and was one
                    of the people who helped break up the Ku Klux Klan. He was, therefore,
                    well-known and well regarded. We changed administrations while I was in Geneva.
                    Abrams, I think, had been a Democrat for Reagan, and he had been appointed to
                    Geneva by Bush (that's the first President Bush). He was replaced by Dan Spiegel
                    when the Clinton administration came in. Spiegel was another attorney who was
                    active in politics and had been one of the top people in Clinton's transition
                    team at State. Spiegel told us he had been heavily involved in the creation of
                    the “G” position (Under Secretary for Global Affairs) because he believed that
                    functional issues like human rights and environment and refugees were not
                    getting enough attention at State. His interest in those issues is what made him
                    interested in the Geneva assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine arriving there in 1991, which is really
                        only two years after the breakup of the Soviet Union... in fact, the Soviet
                        Union hadn't even broken up at that point. But I mean, obviously, such a
                        cataclysmic event in Europe must've had a big impact in Geneva. You must've
                        felt that you were sort of in the center of re-creating Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We did. It was a very exciting time for the United Nations in many
                    fields. Among other things, it helped transform the Human Rights Commission,
                    which I was dealing with, which had been kind of a backwater. The Human Rights
                    Commission was extremely political and had been extremely unpopular. It had not
                    been able to do much during the Cold War because one side or the other would
                    always block everything. The West didn't like it because it didn't seem to do
                    much and the East and Third World didn't like it because they were always
                    potential targets of the Commission because of their bad human rights records. I
                    got to Geneva just as things were beginning to change. In August 1991, just
                    after I arrived, was the failed coup attempt against Gorbachev by Marxist
                    hardliners, which led to Yeltsin's rise to power and the end of the Soviet
                    Union. I remember being in a big UN meeting when the word of the coup attempt
                    started to filter through, and speaking with my Russian colleaguewho I had only
                    just met but would later get to be friends witand how worried they were about
                    developments at home.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the Russians became our friends, as did all the Eastern
                    Europeans. Suddenly, the Cold War dynamics that had paralyzed the United Nations
                    fell away. It suddenly seemed possible, for the first time, to forge a coalition
                    of Western, Eastern, and other democracies within the Human Rights Commission
                    that could make the organization effective and start making human rights a
                    bigger and more integral part of the UN. That became our goal over the next
                    several years, and I think we did it quite successfully.</p>
                <p>We never really got explicit instructions from Washington about this, but we did
                    find strong support for almost all our ideas so we charged ahead. There was no
                    question back theunder George H. W. Bush and Clintothat United States policy was
                    to support international human rights. We had pretty much free reign to develop
                    whatever ideas we could to highlight and advance human rights. I loved working
                    on those issues, because it seemed that it could really affect people's lives
                    for the better and make the world a better place. I mean, we knew that things
                    were not going to change immediately on the ground in far-off countries because
                    of what we were doing in Geneva, but we were setting international rules and
                    making judgments that would make a difference over time and, in some cases,
                    could even lead to immediate changes. You could feel good working with human
                    rights because you almost always had the moral high ground. There was a much
                    clearer sense of right and wrong than you usually get on foreign policy issues
                    and the United States was overwhelmingly on the “right” side back then. I get
                    both angry and sad when I see how much that has changed under the current Bush
                    administration. It's just so hard to believe that the United States is on the
                    wrong side of so many human rights issues and that senior American officials are
                    even advocating torture. It really makes me cringe and makes me happy I'm no
                    longer associated with U.S. positions on human rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>In any event, in the Human Rights Commissiowhich was a big part of our effort to
                    advance human rights in the UN systewe were able to put together a new, often
                    shifting coalition for progress on human rights issues. In addition to the
                    Western countries and our new Eastern friends, we were able to bring most of the
                    Latin American democracies on board and, occasionally, a few of the Africans and
                    Asians. For the first time, the Commission actually started passing resolutions
                    and taking action on difficult issues. Previously, the only time that the United
                    Nations had spoken out against human rights violations in particular countries
                    tended to be a very few instances in Central America countries where the United
                    States was willing to join the Soviets in condemning a particular Latin American
                    dictatorship. Now, we found, we were able to get resolutions against African and
                    Asian human rights violators for the first time. We were also able to develop
                    new mechanisms to highlight human rights problems and recommend solutions. It
                    wasn't all so simple or straightforward, but often we felt like we were on a
                    roll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that the commission had been very unpopular. Was
                        that because it was sort of lousing up relations among different countries
                        or creating other problems, or was it just that it was unpopular with people
                        who were abusing human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was mainly unpopular with the abusers, of course. It was not a very
                    well known organization worldwide and certainly not in the United States.
                    Interestingly, the abusers tended to know and care much more about the
                    Commission than the “good guys,” if you will, because the abusers were afraid
                    that they would get condemned. As a result, a lot of the abusers would work to
                    get themselves elected to the Commission and this would sometimes lead to them
                    being able to block progress. This, in turn, would make the Commission an easy
                    target for critics of the UN, including in the United States. It was easy for
                    the usual UN-bashers to say “look, you've got Cuba and China and Syria and Libya
                    on the Human Rights Commission; that proves it's a joke.” I thought that kind of
                    argument was misguided. It just meant that the Commission was reflective of the
                    UN members. It was still possible to beat those guys if you took a constructive
                    approach and worked at it. We won much more than we lost at the Commission. I
                    was deeply disappointed, therefore, that the U.S. helped lead the charge to do
                    away with the Commission a couple of years ago and replace it with the new UN
                    Human Rights Council. I thought that was very short-sighted and that we lost one
                    of the most important international tools we had against human rights violators.
                    It was another little-noticed instance of the Bush II administration
                    undercutting long-standing U.S. policy on human rights.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>One of the things that convinced me how important the Commission was and how
                    useful and influential its words and actions really could be, was seeing how
                    worried the “bad guys,” or abusers, were that the Commission might say something
                    about them. The abusers really, really didn't want to have the United Nations
                    single them out. They considered it a huge stigma. A number of them would even
                    take some positive steps on human rights to try to get out from under, so that
                    in itself was positive. If you saw the effort that China, for example, would
                    make every year to avoid being considered by the Human Rights Commission, it was
                    just enormous. They would send delegations to every member of the Commission and
                    increase aid programs to those countries. We used to joke that the China
                    resolution in the Commission was the greatest thing for international sports,
                    because the Chinese, in trying to line up votes, would visit many of the little
                    African members of the Commission and offer to build stadiums in their
                    countries. The Chinese head of state would get personally involved in appealing
                    to different countries to support China in the Human Rights Commission. It was
                    really important to them, and that gave us some significant leverage on human
                    rights. The same was true for most other abusers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The bottom line is what they're doing, I mean, not
                        the PR spin but what were they doing vis-�-vis human rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, of course, that was our position. When anybody is seriously
                    violating human rights, they should be called to account. In general, the UN is
                    not going to send in troops to deal with a human rights problem but a UN
                    condemnation is a very significant, important stigma. For the United Nations to
                    tell a country, “you're a human rights violator,” to put them on the short list
                    of countries condemned by name, is something countries just don't want to have
                    happen to them.</p>
                <p>And, in fact, as we pressed human rights issues more vigorously and they became
                    increasing integral to broader UN issues, the UN actually did start sending in
                    troopin a few caseto deal with human rights crises. The first, I think, was
                    Haiti. But also, belatedly, in Rwanda and other countries. Widespread human
                    rights violations came to be regarded as a threat to international peace and
                    security and became a standard issue for peace-keeping operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q.: Well, let's take China and then move on to other
                        countries. During the time that you were there, was the Commission drawing
                        attention to China or was China doing anything about the human rights
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, China was the biggie. It was certainly the largest, most difficult,
                    most time-consuming issue we dealt with. Every year the question that arose was
                    whether there would be a resolution presented in the Human Rights Commission to
                    criticize China's human rights policies. China's human rights situation was
                    extremely grim in very many ways. These were the years not long after the
                    Tiananmen massacre and there was still lots of “reeducation” going on, sentences
                    of administrative detention, political prisoners, labor unions being suppressed,
                    persecution of religious activities, the one-child policy being ruthlessly
                    enforced. There were almost no civil and political rights in China. And, of
                    course, there was Tibet, which was a huge problem in itself and a big aspect of
                    U.S.-China policy within the Commission. I don't think anybody would deny that
                    there was a serious human rights problem in China and that it was one of the
                    world's big violators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling in regard to China that there were
                        those within the State Department and the body politic in the United States
                        who were saying, you're lousing up things here. We've got trade deals, you
                        know, in other words, were you the burr under the saddle or something of
                        that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Absolutely. There was no question about it. There was a very tough fight
                    in the U.S. bureaucracy every year about whether to sponsor a China resolution.
                    I got into that fight from the Washington end in my subsequent assignments.
                    There were a lot of Americans who put other issues ahead of human rights and
                    thought we should not sponsor a resolution. This included lots of official
                    Americans, senior State Department people. In particular, our main opponent was
                    always the China desk, which never liked the idea of a resolution at all and
                    which was a powerful opponent. I used to get irked that much of the State
                    Department, at the instigation of the China desk, even took up the Chinese
                    nomenclature of calling it the “anti-China resolution.” We had to continually
                    remind everyone that it was not an anti-China resolution, and it was not
                    anti-Chinese per se; it was a resolution on the situation on human rights in
                    China, and no one could really deny that there was a problem there.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>From our human rights perspective, we seldom thought that there was a real chance
                    to win a China vote because they were so big and had so much influence with many
                    of the little members of the Commission. They not only sort of bribed countries
                    to vote with them in exchange for aid packages, but they also engaged in a
                    practice of taking reprisals against countries that voted against them in the
                    Commission, by suspending trade deals, and so forth. It was serious stuff. But,
                    sponsoring a China resolution was critical for our credibility with almost any
                    of the other actions we were pushing on human rights. Things were so bad in
                    China and it so dominated the international human rights scene, that for us to
                    ignore it would just feed into the argument being used against us that we were
                    selective and political. How could we press for action on say, Sudan or Burma or
                    Iraq, if we were silent on China? Are human rights just to be imposed by the big
                    guys on the little guys? Why don't you pick on somebody your own size? Are
                    things really worse in Cuba than in China? And so forth. So, for us in Geneva,
                    backing a China resolution was extremely important. If we were going to get
                    anything else done in the Commission, we needed to take on China. It didn't
                    really matter so much if we won or lost the China vote, what we really needed
                    was to show that we were willing to make the effort, that we didn't have a
                    double standard.</p>
                <p>So the battle in Washington over the China resolution was critical to us in
                    Geneva and we inevitably got involved. Sometimes it was high drama. I remember
                    that at my first Human Rights Commission the Europeans put forward a resolution
                    on human rights in Tibet. This almost turned into a disaster. Washington
                    instructed us to vote against the resolution because they thought that it could
                    be read to suggest we supported an independent Tibet. The Chinese were
                    gleefuactually chortlinat the prospect that the U.S. was going to vote with them
                    and against the Europeans about human rights in Tibet, as if everything there
                    were just fine! We couldn't believe it and went back with reclama after reclama
                    about the damage it would do to our human rights policy. This went on until the
                    night before the vote, when we finally got agreement from Washington that we
                    could vote for the resolution if the Europeans would change the title to the
                    “the situation of human rights in Tibet/China.” They reluctantly made the change
                    and we voted in favor, but the resolution was soundly defeated since we had
                    spent so much time on internal bickering that there was no time left to build
                    support among other countries.</p>
                <p>After that, we did sponsor a resolution on China every year that I was working on
                    the issue, both while I was in Geneva and later, while I worked on human rights
                    in the Department, but there was always an internal battle. The final decision
                    to sponsor often came so late that we couldn't run an effective campaign, so the
                    resolutions usually went down in flames. Still, as I said, just sponsoring was
                    the key issue for us, not whether we won or lost.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>There was one more year of very high drama on the China resolution; I can't
                    remember which year it was, I think it was probably 1993 or 1994, possibly '95.
                    Whatever year it was, we had actually made a decision reasonably far in advance.
                    We had lobbied hard in capitals and in Geneva. The Assistant Secretary of State
                    for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, John Shattuck, came out for the vote,
                    together with a senior adviser from the National Security Council. We were all
                    trying to count votes and it was very close. It was a real showdown. The usual
                    Chinese procedure in the Commission was that when the resolution on China came
                    up, they would make a parliamentary maneuver, introducing a motion to take no
                    action on the resolution. There would be a vote on the “no action motion” and
                    every year the Chinese won, so there was never even a vote taken on the actual
                    resolution. Anyway, this particular year it was very close and we had convinced
                    enough countries to vote against the Chinese procedural motion that we had a
                    real chance of defeating it, and even getting the resolution adopted for the
                    first time. The way the Commission's schedule worked out, the China vote came
                    very late in the evening, about 11:00. There was a roll-call vote on the Chinese
                    motion to take no action and it was defeated, for the first time ever, by just
                    one or two votes. Everyone was startled, amazed that we had finally beat the
                    Chinese. Even the Chinese were amazed; they had counted their votes wrong; they
                    had been sure they would win. At that point, however, the chairman suspended the
                    session until the next morning, when the actual vote would take place. We spent
                    much of the night trying to make contact with some of the capitals of Commission
                    members. I think Benin and Ethiopia might have been the key swing votes. We were
                    trying to get to them directly and through the Department, to convey the word
                    that we need you to stand by us on the actual vote. No doubt the Chinese were
                    also making midnight demarches around the world. The next morning there was
                    another roll call vote on the actual resolution. Everyone was biting their
                    fingernails. When the count came in, we lost by one or two votes. I think it was
                    the Russians and Ethiopians that changed their votes and voted against our
                    resolution even though they had voted with us to defeat the procedural motion.
                    So, it was high drama. The big news, however, was we had defeated the no-action
                    motion; the Commission had finally, formally considered the situation of human
                    rights in China for the first time, even though the resolution had been narrowly
                    defeated. It was a symbolic victory. The Chinese took it very seriously. They
                    replaced their ambassador and in following years they redoubled their efforts.
                    It was one of the few times our actions in the Commission actually made the
                    front page of the New York Times.</p>
                <p>There were a few other times we also made the front page of the Times. One was
                    when we passed the first resolution of the UN ever condemning anti-Semitism.
                    That was seen as a real step forward for the UN and involved another complicated
                    drama. Remember that not long before, the UN had been equating Zionism with
                    racism, so the anti-Semitism resolution was seen as a big victory, even though
                    it was quite a convoluted resolution.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>We also created the position of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which was
                    probably one of the greatest human rights achievements of my time in Geneva.
                    This wasn't actually done in the Commission, but through a different mechanism I
                    worked on a lot, the World Conference on Human Rights. The creation of the High
                    Commissioner was a real breakthrough. Symbolically, it elevated human rights to
                    a much higher status in the UN, and in practical terms it eventually meant that
                    a lot more resources were devoted to human rights and that human rights became
                    better integrated into all UN activities. Although it didn't get off to a great
                    start, it did create an institution that has been able to do some real good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem in getting it started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The problem was the selection, basically. There was not enough
                    preparation on the part of the United States or the Europeans in terms of coming
                    up with a good candidate who could really make the most of the new office. An
                    Ecuadorian diplomat, Jos� Ayala-Lasso, was named as the first High Commissioner
                    for Human Rights. Ayala-Lasso was not a human rights expert or crusader. He was
                    quite a gray, non-confrontational kind of diplomat. He had chaired the UN
                    General Assembly subcommittee that drafted the resolution creating the office,
                    so he had a leg up in being associated with the new institution. As a diplomat
                    seeking consensus, he was the kind of person the human rights violators could be
                    more comfortable with, even though his heart was basically in the right place on
                    human rights issues. So, he was not ready to make waves or to try to make the
                    most out of the office, but he did do some useful things to get the office
                    established and get its work started. He actually launched its first field
                    mission, with a lot of U.S. help and encouragement, which set a very good
                    precedent for future activities. And he avoided getting into any trouble, so
                    perhaps that was also helpful in getting the office established and accepted.
                    So, it was a modest start. A stronger personality could have made more of the
                    office and the powers we gave it, I think. Later, when Ayala-Lasso was replaced
                    by Mary Robinson, you got more of the fire-breathing, human rights-backing kind
                    of leadership that I had envisioned for the position, but I was gone by that
                    time. I understand that Robinson's style created its own kind of problems, not
                    surprisingly, I guess, and that she was not necessarily a particularly good
                    administrator and was a little bit of a loose cannon. But it was good to see a
                    UN official speaking out forcefully on human rights issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did information come in about abuses and that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>EICHER: We relied a great deal on nongovernmental organizations, Amnesty
                    International, Human Rights Watch and dozens of smaller organizations that
                    focused on different countries. The UN also had its own human rights mechanisms
                    that brought in information, including the human rights treaty bodies and the
                    special rapporteurs on particular countries or issues. One of the most important
                    things we did, in fact was to greatly expand and strengthen the system of UN
                    special rapporteurs, who were investigating and reporting on human rights
                    violations around the world. There was also a UN subcommission on human rights
                    that developed information, and various working groups, for example on
                    indigenous people, or on “disappearances.” There were other mechanisms,
                    including ones that allowed individuals to complain to the UN about human rights
                    violations. There was even a “confidential” procedure, the so-called “1503
                    procedure,” under which people or groups could bring violations to the attention
                    of the UN; I was the Western member of that group one year. And then, of course,
                    the U.S. was also doing its own human rights reports and we had very good, first
                    hand information from our own embassies about abuses in various countries. So,
                    there was no lack of information coming in. If anything, there was a risk of
                    being overwhelmed by the amount of information coming in. Even in a big mission
                    like ours, there was no way you could get through it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congress mandated these human rights reports, which have
                        gotten honed more and more over the years. There are screams and yells about
                        them within the Foreign Service. I know in the '70s I was in South Korea and
                        we were not too happy with them but anyway, they have become quite a force
                        in international relations. Were other countries doing the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not really, no. Interestingly, China would produce a report on human
                    rights in the U.S. every year, claiming that, you know, China is not the only
                    country with human rights violations, which was true enough, of course. A lot of
                    countries complained that we reported on human rights violations around the
                    world but that we didn't report on ourselves. But I'm not aware of any other
                    country that was writing country reports on human rights as a matter of course,
                    certainly not in the solid manner that the U.S. was doing it.</p>

                <p>EICHER: We were out in front on a number of issues, but there really was a good
                    bunch of reliable countries in Geneva. There was a group in the UN in Geneva
                    that was very strong and well coordinated on human rights issues, which was
                    called the WEOG (the Western European and Others Group). The UN is formally
                    broken down into five geographical groups, in particular for selecting which
                    countries will be members of different UN bodies, which are required to have
                    balanced geographical distribution. The WEOG includes Western Europeans and
                    others, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The WEOG,
                    however, coordinated closely on issues well beyond who would be elected to which
                    UN body. The WEOG would meet regularly during the six weeks of the Human Rights
                    Commission, every morning without fail, to coordinate policies and resolutions
                    and who was going to take the lead on what and generally to plan on what we were
                    trying to achieve and how we would achieve it. It was a very effective group
                    which drove most of the work of the Commission. Most of the Commission's
                    resolutions originated in the WEOG.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was WEOG pretty much of one mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, there were differences from time to time depending on the issues. At
                    that time, the European Union didn't exist yet as it does today. It was before
                    the Maastricht Treaty. They had what they called “the common foreign and
                    security policy,” which often was not a common policy at all. Sometimes you
                    would get splits within the European countries on different issues, which
                    occasionally worked to our advantage, but most often did not. In general, when
                    the Western group was split, it just made us all weaker. The Europeans were
                    generally pretty solid on human rights and we could normally count on them to do
                    the right thing. Occasionally, they would want to take a weaker position on Iran
                    or something than we would.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Helsinki Accords? The OSCE, the
                        Organization for Security and Corporation in Europe? In many ways the
                        Helsinki Accords were considered to be almost the key to the breakup of the
                        Soviet Union and human rights were sort of at the core of that. How did the
                        OSCE work in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was just starting up in those days. In fact, I had virtually nothing
                    to do with it at the time. Later in my life, I spent almost a decade with the
                    OSCE, but at that point they were really just starting out. The Helsinki Accords
                    dated from about 1976, I think it was. They grew out of the CSCE, the Conference
                    for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Only after the fall of communism was
                    there enough constant activity going on, constructive activity going on, that
                    they decided that the CSCE should become an organization, the OSCE, not just a
                    Conference, the CSCE. They didn't set up a full-time secretariat and become the
                    OSCE until about 1993 or 1994. The secretariat was in Vienna, rather than in
                    Geneva, so it wasn't really in my bailiwick, and in any event it didn't get
                    going in a big way until later. The Yugoslavia settlement was what really
                    brought the OSCE to the fore as an active organization.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back, still sticking on the human rights side, going
                        back to China, was there any discernible movement on the part of the Chinese
                        to cut out some of the human rights violations or was it more trying to keep
                        people from criticizing them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That's an interesting issue. Every year as the Commission approached the
                    Chinese would give signals that they would be ready to do a certain number of
                    things if there was no China resolution. This would lead to discussions with
                    them, sometimes by the United States. In fact, I got involved in some of these
                    discussions myself, in a later job, when I went back to work on human rights in
                    Washington. They would signal that okay, they were ready to release prisoner X,
                    or maybe consider doing one or two of the other things we wanted them to do,
                    like sign a new human rights treaty, or ratify one of the major human rights
                    treaties, or move toward some other reform. They were never willing to make an
                    explicit quid pro quo that they would do something in return for dropping the
                    resolution, but the timing always seemed to be centered around the resolution
                    and it was perfectly clear that that's what they were aiming at. Even with no
                    agreement from us, they would almost always do something as resolution time
                    approached, usually release a few prominent prisoners in the weeks or days
                    before the Commission met, or sometimes take some other kind of action. Even if
                    it wasn't enough to stop us from sponsoring a resolution, it would help them get
                    other countries on their side. So it was interesting to watch them. It made us
                    feel like we were doing something right, something that forced the Chinese to
                    take positive steps. Still, it never seemed like they would do enough or that
                    they were sincere about it; they just wanted to do the minimum needed to avoid a
                    resolution. You know, we used to use the term that they would “let a couple of
                    prisoners fall off the back of the truck.” Well, that was nice. It was very
                    positive to actually get people released. It certainly made a difference in
                    those people's lives, as well as making a political point. But, in general these
                    were people who never should have been arrested in the first place and,
                    meanwhile, they would be rounding up half a dozen more dissidents. So, while it
                    was always nice to get people released, and you got a sense of accomplishment
                    from doing it, I became a bit wary of the political prisoners game with the
                    Chinese. They were masters at manipulatiopicking up someone who never should
                    have been picked up and then getting credit, or even concessions, for releasing
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Burma?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Burma was always a big issue. We did certainly have Burma resolutions and
                    there seemed to be a quite solid international support for condemning Burma's
                    actions. There was a lot of support for trying to get Aung San Suu Kyi released.
                    But Burma was one of those pariah regimes that didn't seem very concerned about
                    international opinion. Most states, like the Chinese, would bend over backwards
                    to avoid UN condemnation. A few, like Burma, were beyond the pale; they just
                    didn't seem to care.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Speaking of Burma makes me think of one of the biggest events of my tenure, which
                    I haven't really spoken about yet, the World Conference on Human Rights. This
                    was a big UN world conference that was actually held in Vienna in 1993, but all
                    the preparations for the conference were done in Geneva, because that's where
                    all the international human rights officers were based. So we worked very hard
                    on that. There were lots of preparatory meetings that went on for weeks and
                    involved some very difficult negotiations. Difficult, but fun. I enjoyed
                    multilateral negotiations. You would sit around a table with Iranians and Cubans
                    and others who we don't usually talk with, and try to hammer out agreements. Or,
                    you would sit with like-minded countries and look for ways to circumvent the
                    “bad guys.” Lots of the most important work was done informally in the coffee
                    lounges, rounding up support and cutting deals, not in the plenary sessions,
                    which usually consisted of boring speeches. There was a lot of parliamentary
                    maneuvering, which I got pretty good at. After a while you could get a good
                    sense of what could be adopted and what would face problems, even before
                    consulting anyone else. You could tell what kind of amendments to propose that
                    could win majority support and that might change something really bad into
                    something OK.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I'm digressing. The World Conference, when we finally finished all the
                    preparatory meetings and got to Vienna, produced a declaration that actually
                    included a number of very good things. It was far from a perfect declaration
                    because we were laboring under the constraint that everyone wanted it to be
                    adopted by consensus. In a way, this is a big advantage, because if it's adopted
                    by consensus it really reflects world opinion and no one can later say it
                    doesn't apply to them, since they voluntarily signed on. On the other hand,
                    consensus required very hard negotiations and meant that we couldn't get
                    everything we wanted. Still, there was a lot of good stuff in the declaration
                    and we even had a couple of breakthroughs. We were able to get agreement,
                    worldwide acceptance, for the first time, that human rights is not a just a
                    domestic issue but it is a legitimate concern of the international community.
                    With that, we really should have put the last nail in the coffin of those who
                    claimed that what they do domestically is none of anyone's business and that
                    criticism on human rights issues is interference in internal affairs. The
                    declaration that came out of the World Conference made clear that human rights
                    violations anywhere are everyone's business. So that was a major, hard-fought,
                    victory.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>The other really big accomplishment of the World Conference was laying the basis
                    for the creation of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. With much
                    difficulty, we got a paragraph in the declaration saying that the United Nations
                    General Assembly should consider, as a matter of priority, creating a High
                    Commissioner. This was the result of a lot of really hard work. NGO's had begun
                    floating the idea of a High Commissioner for Human Rights about the time the
                    conference preparations began. I liked the idea, as did others at the U.S.
                    mission in Geneva. We thought it could really make a difference in UN priorities
                    and lead to good things around the world. Washington was much less enthusiastic.
                    Under the Bush administration, they were worried about the “dreaded UN
                    bureaucracy” and they didn't really want to create new UN structures, even on
                    issues that they basically supported, like human rights. We continued to
                    advocate for it from Geneva and won some allies. Part of the problem was that no
                    one really had a clear concept of what a High Commissioner would be or do, or
                    what his or her powers would be. I actually sat down at one point and sketched
                    out in a cable exactly what I thought the concept of High Commissioner should
                    look like and how it should fit into the UN system and sent it to the Department
                    in a cable. That was just about the time that the Clinton administration came
                    into office. They seemed to like it, and it eventually became U.S. policy. After
                    the World Conference, I went to New York in the fall of 1993 and joined the U.S.
                    delegation in to the UN General Assembly, where we actually created the High
                    Commissioner in quite difficult negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they difficult negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, several reasons. I think there was reluctance among much of the
                    Third Worland particularly among the big human rights violatorto create this new
                    position that could end up highlighting some of the problems in their countries.
                    I think that some of the countries that went along at the World Conference with
                    the idea that the UN General Assembly would consider creating a High
                    Commissioner felt that they could kill the idea in New York, or just let it die
                    a quiet death in the General Assembly. These kinds of things usually are adopted
                    by consensus and they felt that by withholding consensus, they could block it or
                    stall it. Even among the countries supporting the idea, there was a lot of
                    controversy over what the new position ought to be and what it ought to look
                    like; not every country accepted all the ideas I had gotten the U.S. to buy on
                    to.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>The negotiations in New York went very slowly, very badly, and we could see that
                    time was running out on the General Assembly session's consideration of human
                    rights. It was clear that we had large majority in favor, but there were a lot
                    of countries that were not enthusiastic and that were willing to let the clock
                    run out. At the same time, we judged that if it came to a vote instead of
                    relying on consensus, there were probably no more than half a dozen countrieif
                    that manthat would actually be willing to stand up publicly and vote against a
                    High Commissioner. Nobody wanted to look like they were blocking a High
                    Commissioner, so that was an advantage for us. The dilemma was that most people,
                    even our closest allies, wanted a consensus, not a vote, and that a few stateI
                    think Cuba, Syria, and for some reason Malaysia, and a couple otherwere
                    deliberately trying to drag things out so there would be no consensus by the end
                    of the session. We got into a squabble with our European allies, who generally
                    wanted consensus, even if it meant waiting until the next year or longer. There
                    was even a sharp division within the U.S. delegation about what we should do
                    under these circumstances. Should we call their bluff and take it to a vote if
                    need be? Or should we negotiate longer in hopes that we could bring them around
                    to a happy solution eventually, even recognizing that this would be next year or
                    the year after that or whatever? I was among those advocating that if we didn't
                    seize the iron while it was hot, we would never succeed. You know, we had the
                    momentum from the Vienna World Conference. If we couldn't do it with that, it
                    seemed to me that the chances of doing it in subsequent years would likely be
                    even less. I also suspected that if it came to the crunch, none of the “bad
                    guys” would want to be seen as voting against this issue. By forcing the issue,
                    we might yet get a consensus, and even if we didn't, we would get a High
                    Commissioner.</p>
                <p>The crunch point, from a procedural point of view, was the deadline for filing a
                    resolution. If there was no resolution filed by the deadline, then there could
                    be no vote or no adoption by the General Assembly and the issue would lapse
                    until the next year. I argued that we should file a draft before the deadline.
                    That would force consideration of something before the end of the UNGA session.
                    If we achieved consensus on another text we could substitute that for ours; if
                    not, we could still amend ours in any way we wanted and bring it to a vote. Or,
                    we could even withdraw it later if we changed our minds for some reason. Others
                    on the negotiating teaincluding especially the head of the team, who was one of
                    our UN ambassadorthought that it would just make people angry for us to file a
                    draft and that it would be better to wait until next year.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>By a happy circumstance, the head of our negotiating team was away somewhere on
                    crunch day, the last day for resolutions to be filed, leaving me in charge of
                    the team. I was able to convince Madeleine Albright, who was then the U.S.
                    Permanent Representative to the UN, through her staff, that we really ought to
                    go ahead and file this resolution, which would ensure that there would be a vote
                    on a High Commissioner before the end of the session. With her approval, I gave
                    instructions five minutes before the filing deadline for one of our team to run
                    down and file our resolution. We waited until the last minute so that no one
                    would have a chance to run down and file a competing resolution. We got a lot of
                    flack from some of our own allies, who thought that filing a draft was
                    confrontational. I remember the British representative, of all people, giving me
                    a really hard time. And, of course, we got even more criticism from the half
                    dozen states who were trying to drag things out. But, the bottom line was that
                    it worked. Despite all the whining, the speed and seriousness of the
                    negotiations improved tremendously. Once people knew that they were going have
                    to vote on something, and that they couldn't just delay it for a year, they were
                    far more inclined to work seriously toward an agreement. As a result, we
                    actually did get a consensus resolution hammered out within a few days, to
                    create a High Commissioner, which was quite a breakthrough. Even a lot of the
                    people who had criticized me for tabling the resolution came to me later to
                    apologize and to admit that the strategy worked well in the end, including, to
                    his credit, my British colleague. The resolution that we finally adopted was not
                    great, but it was adequate. The one clause I insisted on getting in there was a
                    phrase that the High Commissioner's job is to promote and protect all human
                    rights. That's sort of an “elastic clause;” a good High Commissioner could take
                    that phrase and do almost anything. So, in the end, that was one of the big
                    victories of my time in Geneva. Certainly I can't take full credit for it, there
                    were so many people involved. But at the risk of putting modesty aside, I can't
                    help thinking that if I weren't there, it wouldn't have happened.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for, were the geographical bureaus
                        here in Washington sort of weighing in and saying you know, don't upset our
                        clients and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: On this issue not so much, no, because this was not aimed at a particular
                    country. In general, in Geneva we would usually get the State Department's final
                    position sent to us, rather than hearing from individual bureaus or desks. It
                    was later, in my subsequent assignment to the human rights bureau, that I saand
                    was involved imore internal fighting on human rights issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went with the delegation to New York, did you get
                        the feeling that this was a different world than Geneva?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>EICHER: To some extent, but not a lot. I mean, I had been a delegate at previous
                    UN General Assemblies in New York so it was not all new to me. The UN
                    parliamentary rules and procedures were the same in New York and Geneva. More
                    importantly, for these negotiations, I was dealing with a lot of the same people
                    who I had been working with in Geneva and at the World Conference in Vienna. A
                    lot of countries (but not usually the U.S.) regularly send their Geneva officers
                    to New York to follow human rights issues that come up at the General Assembly.
                    So, there were a lot of familiar faces at that negotiation in New York in
                    addition to the procedures also being much the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was a change with the advent of
                        the Clinton administration? It was more liberal, or less real politique,
                        than, say, Bush Sr., who had a lot of experience in the United Nations and
                        had served in China and had been around block and was perhaps more
                        sophisticated. I may be over characterizing, but the Clinton administration
                        came in all bright eyed and bushy tailed, sort of, on human rights. Did you
                        feel that there was almost a fresh impetus on human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: You know, interestingly, not really. The human rights policy changed only
                    in small ways. That's one of the things I liked about it. I found it very
                    reassuring that U.S. human rights policy changed very little, whether you had a
                    right-wing Republican administration or a left wing Democratic administration.
                    Everybody likes human rights. I liked working on human rights partly because you
                    always had the moral high ground and, you know, you could feel good about what
                    you were doing; you could believe in what you were doing. I was happy to let
                    somebody else worry about how this might affect our trade with China or our
                    relations with Colombia or whatever. My job was to point out that China or
                    Colombia or whoever, were human rights violators and that we ought to do
                    something about it. That's not to say that I didn't understand the bigger
                    picture, but I had the luxury of being in positions where I was supposed to be
                    advocating for policies that would promote human rights, in whatever
                    country.</p>
                <p>When I started in Geneva, under Bush Sr., there was actually a lot of focus on
                    human rights. There were probably more State Department personnel devoted to
                    human rights in the UN under Bush than there were under Clinton, when he came
                    in. Certainly in the Bureau of International Organizations there were more
                    people dealing with human rights under Bush than under Clinton, including a
                    couple of high-level envoys. There was one gentleman, Ken Blackwelas a matter of
                    fact, the same Ken Blackwell who is of more recent fame as the secretary of
                    state of Ohio during the last electiowho was the Bush administration's, I can't
                    remember what his exact title was, but in effect he was a special ambassador for
                    human rights and delegate to the Human Rights Commission. He would come out
                    frequently to Geneva and would lead our delegation to the Commission. He did
                    quite a nice job.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>When Clinton came in, that position ceased to exist and some of the support staff
                    which worked for that position ceased to exist. Clinton still did name
                    ambassadors to the Human Rights Commission and very good ones. The first one was
                    Dick Schifter, for the first year of the Clinton administration, and then it was
                    Geraldine Ferraro. So I worked with Gerry as her deputy at the Commission for
                    several years. She was a joy to work with and I think her appointment showed the
                    level of interest of the Clinton administration in international human rights.
                    But in terms of policy, it really didn't change that much. One thing that did
                    change was that the Clinton administration supported the creation of a High
                    Commissioner for Human Rights, while the first Bush administration had still
                    been waffling at the time it left office; it wasn't opposed, but it hadn't made
                    a positive decision, either. But on almost everything else, the positions were
                    very similar on the human rights issues we were dealing with. It's only
                    recently, under Bush Jr., that the U.S. has changed its policies so dramatically
                    on human rights and undercut so much of what we did and lost the high ground
                    that the U.S. always used to be able to claim on human rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Israel sort of a wild card on human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Israel was a big problem for us on human rights and it was one of the
                    instances where it was difficult to keep the high ground. Israel did have big
                    human rights problems. It was violating human rights in a number of very nasty
                    ways and yet the U.S. position was to support Israel and to vote against any
                    resolutions that condemned Israeli practices. Our rationale was that Israel was
                    being picked on unfairly, and to a large extent that was true. There were lots
                    of resolutions condemning Israel's human rights practices, way out of proportion
                    to what was happening there, and the language of the resolutions was often over
                    the top. And some of the resolutions were very political, having more to do with
                    peace negotiation issues than with human rights. But still, some of the points
                    in the resolutions were valid, in light of Israel's violations, and I was
                    sometimes uncomfortable in casting “no” votes in its defense. Overall, though,
                    UN positions on Israel were often so outrageous that they deserved to be voted
                    down. Often, the U.S. was the only “no” vote; anti-Israel resolutions tend to
                    draw an automatic majority in the UN.</p>
                <p>One of the accomplishments of the Commission during my tenure was that for the
                    first time the Commission adopted a resolution supporting the Middle East peace
                    process. This was fun for me, having come out of Middle Eastern affairs. The
                    resolution was a U.S. initiative and I took charge of drafting it and of the
                    negotiations. I was actually negotiating with the PLO delegate and the Israelis
                    on language which probably didn't belong in the Human Rights Commission at all,
                    but we did put some human rights language in there to make it more plausible.
                    But, basically the resolution welcomed the rapprochement between Israel and the
                    PLO and all the good things this would mean for human rights. The resolution was
                    adopted and it may have been the first positive words ever adopted about Israel
                    in the Commission. So, that was another nice accomplishment.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>The anti-Semitism resolution that I mentioned earlier was another plus, from the
                    U.S. and Israeli points of view.</p>
                <p>We also had other Middle East related problems, especially under the Bush Sr.
                    administration, before the PLO became our friends. In particular, there was a
                    quite nasty and ill-fated trip out to Geneva by the then-Assistant Secretary for
                    International Organizations, John Bolton, who, as you know, later became U.S.
                    permanent representative in New York. The goal of his mission to Geneva was to
                    get the Human Rights Commission to disinvite Yasser Arafat from speaking before
                    the Commission. I said this was an ill-fated mission because, if you understood
                    the United Nations, you knew this could not happen. The PLO was accredited as an
                    official observer organization of the United Nations and as such, it was
                    entitled to speak. If the PLO's status at the UN was going to be changed it
                    would have to be by a decision made in New York, not in Geneva. Now, if
                    Assistant Secretary Bolton didn't know this much about UN procedures, or seek
                    advice from those who did before launching a mission, this shows a real lack of
                    both knowledge and judgment. I think Bolton was really more interested in making
                    a political point for domestic audienceto show how strongly pro-Israeli he
                    wathan to really try to accomplish something useful at the Human Rights
                    Commission.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Anyhow, when he finally accepted our explanations as to why he couldn't do what
                    he wanted, then he changed gears slightly and his crusade became “we have to be
                    sure that he is not given any of the honors given to a head of state.” In
                    practical terms, this meant that Arafat should sit at the PLO seat in the
                    assembly hall to give his speech, rather than standing at the podium in the
                    front of the chamber. I'm not at all sure this was a distinction that anyone
                    would notice or care about, aside from those who understand the most arcane UN
                    protocol procedures. In any event, Bolton was determined. His approach to making
                    this happen was also a bit peculiar. He decided he would try to browbeat the
                    WEOG into accepting his position. Once WEOG accepted, he thought, then we could
                    force the position onto the rest of the Commission Members. The whole idea was
                    basically a non-starter. We could have told hiand, in fact did tell hithat the
                    WEOG would not agree and even if it did, the rest of the Commission members
                    would not agree. There was already a precedent for Arafat to speak from the
                    front of the room and there was no way that a majority of Commission members
                    were going to support a change to that. Bolton brushed off any objections we
                    tried to make. He had with him a recent tape recording of Arafat calling Jews
                    “dogs” and he thought that would convince people to crack down on him. I don't
                    think anyone was surprised, however, to learn that Arafat made anti-Semitic
                    remarks. Bolton played the tape at the morning WEOG meeting and then gave an
                    impassioned lecturreally, he was shouting and red-faceto the assembled
                    ambassadors telling them they had to prevent Arafat from standing at the front
                    of the room. His presentation was so embarrassingly out-of-control that it was
                    followed by a stunned silence. The ambassadors, to no one's particular surprise,
                    except Bolton's, were offended by the manner of his presentation. When no one
                    else asked for the floor, the WEOG chairman said “Thank you. Since there are no
                    other comments, we'll move on to the next order of business,” and he changed the
                    subject. Bolton was flabbergasted, outraged, that his proposal would not even be
                    discussed by the WEOG, much less accepted. I remember the French Ambassador
                    eventually took the floor and returned to the subject and gave Bolton a
                    mild-mannered dressing down, saying that the WEOG didn't need to be lectured in
                    that fashion by an American representative and that he disagreed also on the
                    substance of the proposal. A couple of other WEOG members did the same. I should
                    add that Bolton also took the liberty of inviting the Israeli ambassador to
                    attend the WEOG meeting, which was a real no-no under WEOG procedures. The
                    meetings were held at the German mission and they refused to let him into the
                    meeting room, so he sat outside in the lobby while all this was going on. It was
                    embarrassing for everyone. The only result of the whole episode was to strain
                    our relations with the WEOG. Arafat came to the Commission and spoke from the
                    front of the room.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bolton is, to say the least, a controversial character and
                        in a way, this has been his modus operandi, to be a controversial character
                        and a publicity-seeker from the far right. I mean, this is the way he gets
                        his sustenance. How did you, when Bolton came out and before, did you just
                        kind of roll your eyes and you know, let him do his thing and fail or how
                        did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, in fact, that was the first time that I had dealt seriously with
                    him. We did try to explain to him the procedures and the background, as well as
                    how the Commission and the WEOG worked, what the rules were, and what could
                    actually be achieved and what could not be achieved. But he was determined to go
                    his own way on this. He even had a fight in front of two or three of us from the
                    political section, a roaring fight, with Ken Blackwell, our Ambassador to the
                    Commission, threatening to fire him on the spot because Ken pressed our views
                    that Bolton's plan wouldn't work. Bolton just would not be dissuaded from
                    pursuing his goal. I think he was probably egged on by Morris Abram, our Head of
                    Mission, who was always trying to do everything he could to support Israel. But
                    Abram should have known better. In the end, you're probably right that Bolton
                    was looking more at politics and at his domestic audience than he was at the
                    chances of success or of trying to do something constructive at the UN. If you
                    want to get something adopted at the UN, you don't announce it and try to
                    browbeat people, you have to do a lot of careful planning and speaking quietly
                    with people to build support, especially speaking to Third World delegations.
                    All we did in this case was alienate our friends. We never even took it up with
                    countries other than the WEOG, which, I guess, was just as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess Burma was really almost isolated. There wasn't a
                        hell of a lot you can do about that was there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, there was not a lot we could do about Burma. The other country that
                    we really spent a lot of time on was Yugoslavia. That started to fall apart
                    while I was in Geneva. When the war broke out, it was a big issue in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? What was the issue, vis-�-vis
                        Yugoslavia, in the Commission and what were the results?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>We were working on it in a number of ways, although I'm not sure how much we
                    actually accomplished. We were able to call the first-ever special session of
                    the Human Rights Commission, which established a precedent that the Commission
                    could be called to meet in emergency session instead of having to wait until the
                    regular session the following spring before it could take up a fast-breaking,
                    serious human rights issue. So that was a nice step forward. Since the U.S. had
                    called for and organized the special session, I ended up as chairperson of very
                    large, informal drafting committee. Since our Yugoslavia resolution was the only
                    item on the agenda, everyone showed up; we must have had 100 delegates who
                    wanted to make their additions and changes to the draft. And John Bolton came
                    out again for the special session. I'll give him some credit for that. He did
                    support us and did a quite reasonable job in helping us on that. We were able to
                    pass a resolution that had all the appropriate condemnations of various bad
                    things that were going on in the former Yugoslavia. I'm not sure it made any
                    real difference on the ground, but it did help highlight some of the problems
                    and solidify international opinion on them. Even though you could say that it
                    didn't accomplish much concrete, it was regarded as successful enough that we
                    organized a second special session a few months later, as things got worse in
                    Croatia and Bosnia. The former Yugoslavia became a fixture in human rights
                    meetings for the remainder of my time in Geneva.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Human Rights Commission, as things got worse in Yugoslavia, we
                    actually established a sort of little cell within the political section to
                    follow events there, because a lot of information was coming into Geneva,
                    primarily through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which had
                    its headquarters about a block from the U.S. mission. The refugee section of the
                    U.S. mission was also much involved since UNHCR (the UN High Commissioner for
                    Refugees) was involved, as a result of all the ethnic cleansing going on. I had
                    a political officer who would meet every day with the Red Cross and then send in
                    a daily report to Washington on what was going on; it was one of our best
                    sources of information before we opened embassies in Bosnia or the other new
                    countries. When we did recognize Bosnia, it was too dangerous to actually have
                    an embassy in Sarajevo, so the U.S. ambassador-designate, Victor Jacovic, was
                    based in Geneva and worked out of my political section for several months.</p>
                <p>The first peace negotiationthe International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia
                    (ICFY) led by Cyrus Vance - David Owewas also based in Geneva, right in the UN
                    headquarters building there. I had an officer responsible for follow what was
                    going on in those negotiations and would get involved myself from time to time.
                    Aside from day-to-day coverage, there were occasional big negotiating sessions
                    that resulted in a team coming out from Washington, often led by Secretary of
                    State Christopher. Christopher, in fact, became a very common visitor to
                    Geneva.</p>

                        was damn close to the Holocaust, right in Europe, forty years after the end
                        of World War II. How was this impacting on you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, as I said, it was an issue of overwhelming interest and generated a
                    lot of attention and work for us. We were living comfortably in Geneva so it
                    wasn't impacting our daily lives in that sense, but it was a major tragedy and
                    everybody recognized it as such. There was a lot of hand wringing going on. The
                    U.S. felt the Europeans should take the lead and the Europeans couldn't get
                    their act together to take vigorous action. The was a UN force therUNPROFObut it
                    wasn't very effective, and administratively it was handled out of New York, not
                    Geneva. There was an ongoing effort in Geneva to see if there was anything we
                    could do, any way we could contribute, and that's what led to the Human Rights
                    Commission special sessions, and to our work with the ICRC and UNHCR, and with
                    the Vance-Owen negotiations. But, realistically, as active as we tried to be, we
                    were to a large extent on the margins. The peace negotiations didn't really pick
                    up steam until the Dayton talks, which was after I left Geneva, and after Vance
                    and Owen had bowed out. One other thing we did try to do, in fact, in a very
                    early resolution, was to help set the basis for the war crimes tribunal, but our
                    initial effort on that in Geneva was quickly eclipsed by more serious work in
                    Washington and New York, so war crimes moved out of the Geneva optic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Cuba come up at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Cuba always came up. One of the main U.S. goals every year was to pass a
                    resolution on Cuba and we did indeed do that every year. In fact, when I first
                    arrived in 1991, my deputy, who had been there several years, briefed me and
                    said, “Peter, there will be dozens of resolutions at the Human Rights Commission
                    and we'll be expected to be on top of all of them, but in the final analysis,
                    don't forget that the only one that really matters to Washington is the Cuba
                    resolution. If we pass a Cuba resolution, the Commission is a success; if we
                    don't, we'll be seen as having failed.” I think that highlights the Cold War
                    mentality that still prevailed when I got to Geneva. In fact, the Cuba
                    resolution was always important for us politically, but as the Cold War dynamic
                    ended, it was no longer the central theme of what we were trying to do at the
                    Commission. When I got to Geneva, Cuba was the only country resolution that the
                    U.S. took the lead on; by the time I left, we had the lead on at least half a
                    dozen country resolutions, including China, Yugoslavia and many others that took
                    more time than Cuba.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>We actually had a lot of interaction with the Cubans, most of it very unhappy.
                    The Cubans were extremely adept at working the Human Rights Commission and
                    caused us an enormous amount of trouble and headaches. We succeed every year in
                    getting our resolution adopted condemning human rights violations in Cuba. But
                    they managed to succeed in muddying up a lot of other things we wanted to do and
                    generally to cause trouble. In fact, they also sponsored a resolution against
                    the U.S. every year, which was not about human rights in the United States but
                    was one that they called “unilateral coercive measures.” Basically, without
                    naming the United States directly, it was a clear condemnation of the U.S. trade
                    and financial embargo against Cuba. And, every year the Cubans were able to get
                    most of the countries of the Commission, in fact a large majority of countries
                    in the Commission, to agree to a resolution saying that “unilateral” embargos
                    like the U.S. embargo on Cubour trade restrictions on Cuba, which they would
                    call a “blockade” were coercive measures and were a human rights violation that
                    should be condemned. And they succeeded in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like shadowboxing or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was shadowboxing to some extent. We would pass our resolution against
                    them, and they would pass their resolution against us. Ours was certainly more
                    significant, however, since it would name Cuba directly, and since it appointed
                    a special rapporteur to investigate and report on human rights problems in Cuba.
                    Still, you're right that there was a lot of shadow boxing going on at the Human
                    Rights Commission and, in fact, that could sometimes be a lot of fun to work on.
                    I much enjoyed negotiating in the United Nations and many of the endless debates
                    and talks over how you were going to word something, or how you could promote
                    your initiative or kill someone else's bad initiative, or how you could word an
                    amendment that could get adopted and substantially change the meaning of a
                    resolution you didn't like. Sometimes it would be scoring points over your
                    opponents rather than necessarily creating anything that would really matter in
                    the real world. So, this part of the work could be fun, or could be frustrating,
                    but a lot of it was just a game. We realized that. I had visitors who would come
                    out for a few days to help with one issue or another who would say, “Oh, my God.
                    Condemn or strongly condemn? Deplore or deeply deplore, what difference does it
                    make? How can you deal with this every day?” Once you got immersed into the
                    minutia, however, you started to realize that in the context you were working
                    in, it did make a bit of a difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>Further on the Cubans, when I say they were excellent at causing trouble, it went
                    way beyond the “universal coercive measures” resolution. Every year they would
                    come up with some truly evil little ideas that, if adopted, would have
                    undermined the UN human rights structure that we were trying to build up. It
                    would be almost full-time work for a couple of members of our delegation to try
                    to head off various bad Cuban initiatives. With the help of the Europeans, we
                    were usually able to render them harmless, but sometimes they would score
                    points. They were masters at coming up with things that, on the surface, would
                    appeal to other Third World countries. There was a shifting little group of
                    other countries that we sometimes called “the bad guys,” including Iran and
                    Syria, among others, who were always ready to work with the Cubans. It was very
                    irritating. But, a lot of us got to know each other and there was some
                    camaraderie, too. In later years, at the OSCE, where there were no such overt
                    “bad guys,” I sometimes actually missed not being able to have a good,
                    parliamentary fight with the Cubans and Iranians. It could really get your
                    adrenaline going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take, still sticking to human rights, after four
                        years there, did you see any machinery that was set up that was making a
                        difference between whether somebody got their fingernails pulled out or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think we did. I think we really made some progress. I think the things
                    we did really helped some people. How much of it was due directly to our work or
                    how much was the happy confluence of events in the world that we were able to
                    take advantage of, somebody else would have to judge. But we did create a lot of
                    UN mechanisms which are making a difference. We created a lot of special
                    rapporteurs, who are special UN envoys who go look at particular problems or
                    particular countries and publicize problems and try to persuade the governments
                    to improve practices. So, there is a special rapporteur on torture and a special
                    rapporteur on religious freedom and a special rapporteur on independence of the
                    judiciary and a whole string of others, most of which were created during my
                    time in Geneva, who are out there highlighting problems, proposing solutions and
                    making a difference. Plus, of course, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and
                    the advent of actual UN human rights offices in different countries of the world
                    have started to change the international culture about human rights and the
                    acceptability of foreigners raising human rights as an issue. I think these
                    mechanisms have started to get some governments to behave more responsibly in
                    some cases. We also created new treaty provisions on human rights, for example,
                    a protocol to the anti-torture convention under which an international team
                    could visit prisons, unannounced, to check on conditions and what was happening
                    there. The U.S. used to support that kind of initiative; we really believed in
                    fighting torture. And, of course, with every resolution, we were setting
                    standards of what the international community should be abiding by. For example,
                    I think one of our Yugoslavia resolutions was the first time that rape was
                    labeled as a war crime. That had important implications for later efforts to
                    prosecute crimes.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>So it was rewarding in that sense. You know, as often as you didn't get the
                    result you wanted to on a particular resolution, or even though you sometimes
                    felt like you were only playing politics or working around the margins of
                    important issues, very often you really did feel as if you were making a
                    difference. I think our work did improve people's lives and cast a bit of light
                    into the darkness. I think we did save some individuals here and there, and hold
                    some brutal regimes to account, and establish some lasting procedures. So you
                    could feel good about human rights work. I liked doing it; I felt like I had
                    found my niche.</p>
                <p>I think that perhaps one of the lasting legacies of some of the work we dithe
                    work we participated in, and in some cases launcheis that now, within the United
                    Nations system, human rights is truly ingrained as one of the major, mainstream
                    issues. When I got to Geneva one of the goals I had was to try to bring human
                    rights out of the narrow confines of the Human Rights Commissions and into the
                    broader work of the UN and the other UN agencies. I visited a lot of agencies
                    and I asked them about it. Almost uniformly, they would recoil. You know, the
                    office of the High Commissioner for Refugees would say, “Oh, no. Human rights is
                    a political issue; keep it in the Human Rights Commission,” and WHO would say,
                    “it's a political issue, keep it away from us.” And this is the kind of response
                    I got, from one agency after the other. By the time I left Geneva, every one of
                    these same agencies was proudly saying, “We do human rights; we work on human
                    rights; our program is based on human rights.” Even UNICEF, which may be the
                    least political of the agencies, was saying that their entire program was based
                    on a human rights convention that originated in the Human Rights Commission, the
                    Convention on the Rights of the Child. So it was a real change in approach. In
                    the work of the UN now, human rights is almost always taken into account as a
                    matter of both policy and bureaucratic procedure; there is a human rights person
                    sitting at the table during policy discussions, and there are human rights
                    experts attached to most UN field offices. So I think that's an important
                    legacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any NGOs, non-governmental organizations,
                        taking on a stronger role as being an unofficial adjunct to the whole human
                        rights process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think so. As a result of human rights having a greater role, their
                    influence also became greater. You also have to give them a lot of credit
                    because they're the ones who are on the ground, around the world, finding out
                    what the problems are and publicizing them, often at great personal risk. Very
                    often they face persecution for trying to get the word out. I have tremendous
                    admiration for them. They also came up with lots of ideas on how to promote
                    human rights, some of which were great. They were happy to share ideas and
                    delighted if a government actually took up one of the ideas and supported
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over the years, over time, we're talking about the last
                        couple of decades, these groups have really become an extremely important
                        element.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>EICHER: Absolutely. We always found that you could work in partnership with them
                    to great effect. A lot of officials, including American officials, considered
                    NGOs a pain because they were always criticizing us as well as other countries,
                    and they were never satisfied; they always wanted you to do more. But you need
                    to accept that that was their job, their purpose, to urge governments to do
                    more. As a representative of a country trying to promote human rights, I quickly
                    came to understand that the NGOs were our natural allies, even if they didn't
                    always agree with our positions. And they were generally easy to work with and
                    to get along with. They were so used to being blown off or ignored by government
                    delegations that they were really pleased when a delegation was actually willing
                    to take them seriously and cooperate with them, even if you couldn't always
                    agree with them. I spent a lot of time with them and gave events for them at my
                    home. They made wonderful partners.</p>

                        the rending aside of the Iron Curtain, one real negative was human
                        trafficking, essentially the recruitment of Eastern European young women to
                        become prostitutes. Often they did not know what they were getting into.
                        This whole trafficking of humans and also, I guess, of young boys and all.
                        Did that fall under your province at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: This was just starting to be seen as a big issue at the time I was in
                    Geneva. It wasn't yet seen as an East European problem at the time, but it was
                    emerging as an issue that was referred to either as “modern day forms of
                    slavery” or as “sale of children,” depending on which facet of it you were
                    considering. There were a few activists and NGOs already doing some work on
                    “modern day forms of slavery,” which included everything from vestiges of
                    slavery-like practices in Mauritania, to forcible recruitment of child soldiers
                    in Sudan, to sweat shops and various kinds of indentured labor, as well as what
                    we now call human trafficking. The U.S. had not really taken this up as a big
                    issue yet.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>The “sale of children” aspect of it, like so many other human rights issues,
                    became very politicized. The U.S. was against taking action on this issue
                    because, I think, there wasn't a clear understanding of what was really going on
                    with modern day slavery and because the Cubans and some others were successfully
                    twisting it to suggest that American adoptions of Central American children was
                    part of the problem of “sale of children.” There was even one very awkward
                    evening at the Human Rights Commission when I was in the U.S. chair, during an
                    effort by the Commission to get approval for drafting a new conventioor more
                    technically a protocol to the existing Convention on the Rights of the Chilon
                    the subject of sale of children. We had instructions that if it came to a vote,
                    we the U.S. should vote “no.” The European country that was in charge of
                    derailing this resolutioPortugal, as I recalmanaged to mangle it, and all the
                    European countries then suddenly changed their positions to support the
                    resolution. We were left standing alone in opposition. The optics were
                    terriblthe U.S. was the only country in the world blocking progress on
                    protecting children from predators. There was no time for new consultations with
                    Washington to modify the U.S. position. So, after a lot of unpleasant
                    back-and-forth debate on the floor of the Commission, I made a policy decision
                    and violated my instructions and joined consensus on the resolution. I thought
                    Washington would be furious and worried about what kind of reprimand I might
                    get. But, as it turned out, no one in Washington seemed to care very much, so I
                    guess the story had a happy ending. The protocol in question was eventually
                    drafted and adopted, and it is now part of the Convention on the Rights of the
                    Child. Most countries have ratified it, but the U.S. never even ratified the
                    Convention, much less the protocol.</p>
                <p>As for human trafficking as we know the issue today, it had not yet become a
                    well-publicized issue while I was working in Geneva. A bit later in my life,
                    when I was working for the OSCE, I worked a lot on combating trafficking; I
                    actually established the first OSCE programs to combat trafficking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Rwanda?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>EICHER: Rwanda did happen, yes. That was one of the huge human rights tragedies
                    that happened while I was in Geneva. Maybe the biggest. We did have a special
                    session of the Human Rights Commission on Rwanda. I was there for the
                    preparations but didn't attend the actual session, since I was back in the U.S.
                    for my oldest son's wedding. The Human Rights Commission did adopt a resolution,
                    which, I guess, helped attract world attention to the horrors that were going on
                    there, even if it didn't change much on the ground. But on Rwanda, what can I
                    say? The world failed Rwanda. There were just too many crises going on at once.
                    Most Western focus was still on Yugoslavia. Even on that, the West wasn't ready
                    to intervene militarily, and that was much closer to home and getting much more
                    media attention. There were also little wars going on in a number of the former
                    Soviet countries, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia. The war in Chechnya was also
                    starting. Everyone was still talking about the “peace dividend” that was
                    supposedly coming with the end of the Soviet Union and, instead, here were
                    little wars breaking out all over the place. Governments didn't have the stomach
                    for military intervention, especially in Africa, which seemed so much further
                    away. In fact, only a few months before, the Clinton administration had tried a
                    small scale military intervention in Somalia to restore peace there, which ended
                    up being a failure; remember, the U.S. withdrew after a Blackhawk helicopter was
                    shot down and bodies of American soldiers were dragged through the streets. So
                    the U.S. really wasn't ready for another African adventure and other countries
                    didn't step up to the plate, either.</p>
                <p>The crises in Yugoslavia, and especially in Rwanda, did get people talking about
                    the idea of “humanitarian intervention” as a right or a duty of states when
                    horrible things were going on in a country. The idea was very controversial
                    because normally the UN wouldn't interfere in any country's internal problems
                    unless they also threatened international peace and security. The genocide in
                    Rwanda helped make the idea of humanitarian intervention respectable, if not
                    fully accepted.</p>
                <p>Eventually, later on, Rwanda became the first country in which the UN established
                    a human rights office, under the authority of the new High Commissioner for
                    Human Rights. So that in that sense, looking through a bureaucratic lens, the
                    machinery that we had set up by creating a High Commissioner was ultimately used
                    to help deal with the aftermath of the genocide. But international efforts on
                    the genocide itself were totally inadequate and too late.</p>
                <p>In fact, back then everyonincluding the United Statewas unwilling to concede that
                    what was going on in either Yugoslavia or Rwanda was genocide. There is a UN
                    Convention against Genocide, that the U.S. and most other countries have
                    ratified, that obliges the signatories to take action to end genocide if it is
                    taking place. So the U.S. at first avoided using the “g” word, and eventually
                    starting using the term “acts of genocide,” instead of just plain “genocide,”
                    since the lawyers said that would not trigger our obligations under the treaty.
                    It was crazy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Rwanda one of these things that developed so quickly
                        that it was almost not feasible to have a real response, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Being in Geneva, I wasn't really close enough to the policy makers to be
                    able to make a real judgment on that. Certainly, it happened very quickly and
                    unexpectedly, at least from our perspective in Geneva. It was also over fairly
                    quickly; it lasted only about three months, I think, which, of course, is a long
                    time if you're on the ground watching people get killed, but a short time in
                    terms of building up momentum for international intervention in a crises.
                    Yugoslavia, in contrast, went on for years. I think it would have been possible
                    for the international community to have a more vigorous response to Rwanda,
                    which might not have prevented the genocide from starting, but would have ended
                    it more quickly. But for all those reasons I mentioneand probably other reasons
                    that I didn't know or have since forgottethere was just no inclination by the
                    international community to get involved, until it was way too late.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that hang over you? Were people coming in and telling
                        you about the horror stories or was there sort of a filter to that while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The information we got was indirect. I didn't have a lot of people coming
                    in telling me specifically about what was happening in Rwanda. There weren't
                    Rwandans getting on airplanes to Geneva to tell their stories personally. But we
                    were getting information from the International Red Cross and from UN agencies
                    and from NGOs and even from our own government. It would be nice to say that the
                    international community didn't act because it didn't know what was going on, but
                    I think people had a reasonable idea what was going on. Perhaps there wasn't a
                    full grasp of how extensive, how massive the genocide was, but there was enough
                    information to know that there was a really big, serious problem going on in
                    Rwanda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Geneva, I think we'd better talk about
                        some of the other aspects of this. We've talked almost completely on human
                        rights. Were there any other issues you were involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, there were quite a few. I spent a reasonable amount of time with the
                    International Labor Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
                    I had an officer working full time on each of those in my section. For me, it
                    was mainly a supervisory role, although there were issues that I got involved
                    in. In particular, each of those organizations would have big annual meetings,
                    the World Health Assembly and the International Labor Conference. I was always
                    on those delegations, which were often headed by a U. S. cabinet secretary;
                    usually, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Secretary of Labor would
                    come out for the meetings. It was often Donna Shalala and Robert Reich during
                    most of my time. In the WHO, a lot of the issues were technical health issues
                    which I didn't have much to do with. But there were always political issues that
                    would come up; a certain number of political issues would always arise within
                    these organizations and that's really what I was there to deal with.</p>
                <p>One issue you could count on almost every year was a membership issue: are we
                    going to let the PLO have a seat or not? We were always trying to make sure the
                    PLO did not get admitted as a state, although we didn't try to block observer
                    status for the PLO. But every year it seemed that there would be a fight in the
                    credentials committee, with someone trying to sneak the PLO in while we weren't
                    looking, so we would have to be there to object and to fight it off. Then we
                    started to have the same kind of fight about Yugoslavia. Our position was that
                    when Yugoslavia broke up, Serbia did not automatically become the successor
                    state that automatically got Yugoslavia's seat in the UN and other
                    organizations. The Serbs were already regarded as the aggressors in the
                    Yugoslavia conflict and we didn't want them to be rewarded as the legitimate
                    government entitled to a seat at the table at every international organization;
                    we thought they should apply for membership, just like Croatia and Bosnia and
                    the other successor states had to do. The Serbs, however, took the view that
                    they were the successor state and acted as though they automatically inherited
                    the UN and other agency memberships. So, one of the sometimes-tedious things we
                    were doing at all the different agencies in Geneva was trying to make sure that
                    the Serbian regime did not show up and claim the Yugoslavian seat. In fact, we
                    had to brief every delegation to every small technical meeting about this and
                    ask them to give us a call immediately if any Yugoslav appeared. This happened
                    often, at first, and I or one of my political officers would have to run down to
                    whatever meeting it was and give the standard speech about why Serbia should not
                    claim the successor seat for Yugoslavia. Sometimes we had to demand a vote or
                    obstruct proceedings until we could get them out of there. We had to deal with
                    this issue at the Health Assembly and the International Labor Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we carrying that particular pail of water or were
                        other delegations doing the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>EICHER: Most of the Europeans were with us. Their missions weren't quite as big
                    and well organized as we were and often didn't have people attending the little
                    technical meetings like we always did, so very often we would be the first to
                    hear about the problem. But, since they shared our position, one of the things
                    we would do if a Yugoslav did show up was to phone around right away to the
                    other missions and make sure that other representatives who shared our views
                    appeared at whatever little technical meeting it was, to join us in our
                    objection. Sometimes they would even take the lead in objecting. There was a
                    period where the Serbian membership issue came up constantly, but eventually the
                    Serbs realized they were beaten and showed up less often.</p>
                <p>There were also other political issues that would come up. One issue that seemed
                    to come up regularly in the World Health Assembly, for example, was an item
                    called “the health effects of nuclear war.” This was an attempt by a few of the
                    radical Third World countries to stick it to the United States. The idea was
                    that the U.S., being the last remaining superpower, should get rid of all of its
                    nuclear weapons in the interest of world health. Well, I guess you can't argue
                    that nuclear weapons aren't bad for people's health, but this was clearly a
                    disarmament issue that had no business being decided in the World Health
                    Assembly. There were all kinds of strategic arms limitation talks going on in
                    Geneva; that was the place to discuss disarmament, not in the WHO. Those were
                    the kinds of things that would come up. There were also leadership issues. The
                    head of the WHO was a Japanese man, Dr. Nakajima, who had proved to be a very
                    ineffective administrator. We were trying to organize a campaign to get him
                    replaced, but even though pretty much everyone acknowledged that he was bad for
                    the organization, the Japanese were pretty effective in keeping him there. He
                    was eventually replaced, but not until after I left Geneva.</p>
                <p>One other interesting issue that kept coming up at the WHO during my timwhich
                    really wasn't a political issue that I had to deal witwas the question of
                    whether to destroy the last remaining smallpox virus. Smallpox had been entirely
                    eliminated as a disease all over the world; there hadn't been a single case
                    anywhere, in years. The two last remaining samples of the virus were held by the
                    U.S. and the Russians at secure health laboratories. So, there was this ongoing
                    discussion of whether it was better to destroy them, and thus permanently rid
                    the world of what had been such a terrible scourge over many centuries, or keep
                    them, because we shouldn't be destroying the last of a species, no matter how
                    bad it seemed to be. The inclination on all sides at the time was leaning to
                    destroying them, but the final decision was never actually taken, so the
                    specimens remained, hopefully, still safely locked up. In light of this
                    background, I was amazed when I heard a couple of years ago that the current
                    Bush administration was undertaking a massive program to produce smallpox
                    vaccine and inoculate all the American soldiers going to Iraq against smallpox.
                    I still can't understand why this was necessary, unless we were wrong all those
                    years in Geneva about the last viruses being tucked safely away, or unless it
                    was all a propaganda effort to try to show that Saddam Hussein really did have a
                    biological warfare program.</p>

                        back to the beginning of the Cold Wathere was tremendous emphasis on labor
                        unions as a bulwark against the Soviets, who were trying to establish their
                        own unions. Particularly as the political strength of labor unions had gone
                        down in the United States, did you get a feeling that the International
                        Labor Organization was not really a very high priority?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, certainly I would agree that it was not a very high priority among
                    all the issues and organizations we had to deal with in Geneva. But it did get
                    some attention; as I said, the annual delegation to the International Labor
                    Conference was sometimes headed by a cabinet secretary, at least during the
                    Clinton administration. Since I knew so little about the ILO before I got to
                    Geneva, I was struck at how big and active and well regarded it was. I was
                    impressed at how effectively it operated. The ILO actually predates the United
                    Nations. Even though it's now considered a United Nations specialized agency,
                    it's older than the United Nations. It operates on a tripartite basis, which is
                    unique. Every delegation, every country's delegation, is made up of three
                    components: government, labor and employers. So you really are including all the
                    three of the components you need in order to try to reach some kind of consensus
                    or agreement to move things forward on labor issues. I guess in my ignorance I
                    had expected the ILO to be made up of a bunch of labor leaders pressing for
                    action on their issues. And there were a lot of labor leaders, of course, but
                    there were also a lot of chamber of commerce people and businessmen and
                    government officials. Almost every year there would be an effort to pass a
                    couple of new conventions setting new and better standards on some pressing
                    aspect of labor law or labor conditions. Some of these were major issues, like
                    child labor, but a lot of them were just little things around the margins, say,
                    setting agreed, minimum international safety standards in industries using some
                    particular type of dangerous materials. There are now over 200 international
                    labor conventions; it's a wonderful body of standards, even though some of them
                    are not very strict. About a dozen of them make up the “core conventions” that
                    people cared most about, but there were also many others. These conventions are
                    treaties, which legally bind countries to abide by them once they have been
                    ratified. The ILO continues to set standards and to monitor the implementation
                    of standards on many, many labor and safety issues. It's quite a useful process.
                    I was really very impressed with the ILO and was happy to have been involved
                    with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about say, India and Pakistan, particularly India, a
                        big democracy but one where an awful lot of kids, very young kids, are
                        involved in child labor. How was it dealt with.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>EICHER: The ILO wasn't generally an organization where you would take a
                    particular country to task for what it was doing. You know, if you wanted to
                    criticize India on child labor, you would do it in the Human Rights Commission,
                    not at the ILO. Delegations at the ILO usually tried to maintain a constructive,
                    cooperative approach. Because of the tripartite nature of the delegations, even
                    India's delegation would have labor leaders who were likely to be saying the
                    same about child labor as India's critics would be. It wasn't an organization
                    where I recall there being a lot of high-level confrontation and
                    finger-pointing, although sometimes that did happen. More likely, if the ILO saw
                    a problem with child labor in India, it would look for ways of trying to put new
                    rules in place aimed at making things better. For example, there might be a new
                    convention that would prohibit child labor in dangerous industries, like the
                    glass industry or the match industry, or that would limit or end some specific
                    practices. You know, recognizing the reality that children are working, at least
                    let's start by getting them out of the more dangerous industries, and make a
                    step toward ending the worst abuses. The ILO also had mechanisms to check on how
                    countries were doing in meeting their obligations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In human rights, was child labor a problem, an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was an issue that did come up, although it was not a front-burner
                    issue. One particular children's issue which came up during my time was street
                    children. The Europeans, in particular, seemed to be very interested in trying
                    to do something about the problem of street children in Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazil, of course, is a prime example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Exactly. Although street children are a problem in many countries, the
                    situation is particularly bad in Brazil and, although the Brazilians were not
                    specifically named in a resolution, they certainly felt like it was criticism
                    aimed at them. In fact, I have to admit that as much as I recognized street
                    children as a problem, I was not very happy to see the Europeans take this issue
                    up in the Human Rights Commission because, if you recall, I said that we had
                    been able to forge a coalition of Eastern and Western Europeans and Latin
                    Americans, that was critical in order to get enough votes to pass anything
                    positive in the Commission. So, as the Europeans started targeting Latin
                    American democracies on this kind of issue, those countries started wavering on
                    their support for us on some of the other issues, like China, or Burma or other
                    things we wanted their help on. Still, I remember that we did pass a resolution
                    on street children. We were able to maintain Latin support on most of the other
                    issues, but it became more difficult once they found themselves as targets.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>The other child issues that we were involved in, included negotiating a couple of
                    protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I've already mentioned
                    the protocol on “sale of children.” Another protocol was on the age of military
                    service. That one was an effort to make it an international standard that kids
                    could not be recruited into the armed forces until they turned eighteen. This
                    was a problem for the United States because at the time we could still recruit
                    people at seventeen and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as I know, regardless of past standards, people
                        joined the military and particularly the navy, at seventeen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think the U.S. has now changed its policy on that, partly as a result
                    of this protocol that was negotiated in Geneva and even though the U.S. has
                    never ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I think our first
                    gambit was, “OK, we recruit at seventeen and a half, but we'll make sure no one
                    goes into combat until age eighteen.” I was actually surprised when the U.S.
                    changed its position on this and now, I believe, we do not recruit people
                    younger than eighteen. This was actually a bigger problem for some of our allies
                    than for us. The British and Dutch, I think, still had a practice of enlisting
                    boys of sixteen on naval ships as cabin boys. They also phased that out, I
                    think. So this, maybe, is one more example of our work at the Commission having
                    an effect in the real world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. With the political appointees coming in
                        and ouyou mentioned Boltowas there, in the four years you were there, did
                        you see much of a clash between the political types versus the career types
                        in what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Other than that one incident with Bolton that I mentioned, very little.
                    Again, it was very reassuring that human rights had a solid backing within all
                    stripes of the U.S. government, under both Republican and Democratic
                    administrations. To some extent, interestingly, the more liberal Democrats and
                    the more conservative Republicans would tend to have the same views on human
                    rights issues, and it was the middle-of-the-road politicians who would sometimes
                    let you down. These were often reasonable people but, while they supported human
                    rights, they would often look at the bigger foreign policy picture and their
                    views on trade relations and so forth might trump their concerns about human
                    rights. China was a good example of this; the middle-of-the-road politicians
                    would speak out about human rights problems in China, but then vote for
                    permanent most-favored-nation status for trade with China. But the very
                    conservative Republicanthe libertarians and politicians concerned about
                    individual rights and too much government meddlinand very liberal Democrats
                    tended to be very solid supporters of human rights in any country.</p>

                    <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, when you think about it, it's a little hard for
                        anyone to say, “Well, you know, yes, we know they're beating up and jailing
                        people, but we we've got other fish to fry.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Indeed. One of the things I loved about working in human rights was you
                    always had the moral high ground. You could really believe in the positions you
                    took, really have confidence that you were doing what was right. I liked human
                    rights work enough that I spent the rest of my career on it. When I left Geneva
                    in 1995 the Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, who I had
                    gotten to know fairly well from his trips to Geneva and through our work
                    together at the World Conference on Human Rights, John Shattuck, asked me to
                    come back and be his special assistant in Washington.</p>
                <p>To wrap up on Geneva, I should just say that living there was very nice, as you
                    might expect. It was a small city, only about 300,000 people I think, but it
                    felt very cosmopolitan because, being a UN headquarters, there were so many
                    international people there. There wasn't all that much to do right in Geneva,
                    but we entertained officially quite a bit and had a busy official social life.
                    We also made a lot of good friends. Two of our sons graduated from the
                    international school there, which they liked very much. Geneva was beautifully
                    situated right on the lake and within easy drive of an endless number of
                    wonderful old castles, or medieval villages or alpine resorts. Switzerland was
                    so beautiful we used to say it was like living in a postcard. And Geneva was a
                    great base to get around to other places. We could drive to France in six
                    minutes from our house, and could be in Italy within an hour's drive. Germany
                    was only a couple of hours away. So, we ended up seeing a lot of Europe, which
                    was a great plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We'll pick this up in 1995 when you were working for
                        John Shattuck on human rights. Could you sort of give a feel for how things
                        stood when you arrived at the human rights bureau? Could you give a feel for
                        where the human rights bureau stood, bureaucratically, in the Department?
                        During the early Carter years, Pat Darien was really upsetting the staid
                        halls of the State Department, charging around on human rights issues but,
                        by this time, how would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: By the time I returned to Washington, I had been working on human rights
                    in Geneva for four years, so I felt well connected to the bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>In any case, the human rights bureau was very active and it was well established
                    in the bureaucracy. In fact, it had recently changed its name from Hwhich was, I
                    think, originally, the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, before
                    humanitarian affairs became a separate, refugee bureato DRL, which stood for the
                    Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. I think the name change came at the
                    beginning of the Clinton administration, when they created the new Under
                    Secretary for Global Affairs, known as “G.” DRL was one of the G bureaus.
                    Anyway, the name change was recent and most people around the Department still
                    called us HA; we had to constantly remind people of the new name. In any event,
                    the bureau was well established bureaucratically. We were invited to meetings
                    and we were usually remembered in the clearance process. In general we didn't
                    have to push our way into most things. And, I should say, the importance of
                    supporting human rights had been accepted as a basic element of U.S. policy. The
                    major battles in that sense had been fought already. Everyone purported to
                    support human rights, it was just a question of how much emphasis to give to
                    human rights, as compared to other issues.</p>
                <p>However, DRL was, I think, like most of the “functional bureaus” in the
                    Departmenthat is, the bureaus dealing with issues rather than specific
                    geographical areareally regarded as something of a backwater. Human rights still
                    weren't mainstream. The real power in the Department was on the geographic
                    desks. From a policy perspective, while we might be invited to meetings and get
                    copies of cables and things like that, we did have to push very hard in most
                    cases, when we wanted human rights to be considered as a real issue in our
                    relationship with countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were with the bureau from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: From 1995 until the very beginning of 1998. For the first year I was
                    there I was special assistant to John Shattuck and after one year I moved over
                    and became the Director of the Office of Bilateral Affairs, which was by far the
                    largest office in DRL.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start with John Shattuck. Can you describe your
                        impression of him as an operator within the State Department system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>EICHER: He was quite an operator and he was very well-connected. He was a
                    tremendous activist. He was just a whirlwind. He was on the move all the time.
                    He tried to have an impact on a lot of different issues and he soon discovered
                    that there were problems in trying to move human rights issues within the State
                    Department bureaucracy, that people sometimes didn't want to hear about human
                    rights because they were a problem for other parts of our relationships with
                    countries. One of the methods he had devised to deal with this was to sort of
                    insert himself indirectly by traveling to places that were controversial or to
                    trouble spots where there were particular human rights problems. Just by being
                    there, as an assistant secretary, he would get a lot of attention on the ground
                    and have a lot of high level meetings. He would do a lot of reporting back to
                    the secretary and other top officials, and the trips required a lot of
                    coordination with other bureaus. So, he sort of forced the other bureaus to
                    include him in the policy mix, through his tendency and willingness to dash off
                    to Bosnia or Rwanda or Turkey or Indonesia or wherever the trouble spot of the
                    moment happened to be. So that was effective, to a certain extent, in ensuring
                    that human rights stayed on the agenda of whatever country or countries we felt
                    we needed to press our case on. It also helped a lot in policy debates in the
                    Department, since instead of just interjecting some vague point of principle on
                    human rights, he could say, “Well, I was just in country X and ....”</p>
                <p>As his special assistant, I did travel with him from time to time. I could have
                    gone much more, but he was constantly on the road and I didn't really want to be
                    away that much. At the time, the bureau's focus, its overwhelming focus, was on
                    Bosnia. The war in Bosnia was still very rough at that time, even though
                    negotiations had started. The Dayton talks actually took place during the period
                    while I was special assistant. Shattuck was at the Dayton talks and I was
                    backing him up from Washington. If you look at the Dayton Agreement, you'll see
                    that it is very heavy on human rights. The constitution of Bosnia and
                    Herzegovina that came out of Dayton is also very heavy on human rights, much
                    more, even, than the U.S. constitution. I believe there were so many human
                    rights provisions included partly as a result of Shattuck's influence.</p>
                <p>Another major thing we were trying to do on Bosnia was set up and support the
                    International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the Bosnia war
                    crimes tribunal. This was a big issue in the bureau, and in the Department. I
                    went with Shattuck to The Hague a couple of times to try to move this forward.
                    There were some difficult bureaucratic problems that were standing in the way of
                    U.S. assistance to the tribunal, which we had to work out. We'd meet with the
                    chief prosecutor, who was Louise Arbour at the time, and with others. Arbour is
                    now the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. We also went to Brussels
                    regularly to coordinate with the Europeans on human rights issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>I also had a couple of trips with Shattuck to the former Yugoslavia, which were
                    quite tough trips at the time, because although most of the active fighting had
                    stopped on the ground by that time, it was still a reasonably dangerous place.
                    On my first trip we were trying to go to Banja Luka, which was the biggest Serb
                    city in Bosnia, and there had not been an official U.S. visitor there at all. We
                    were going to get there by helicopter from Zagreb. But, the fog was very bad in
                    the Balkans at that time of year and so we were fogged in and the helicopters
                    couldn't fly out of Zagreb. We ended up trying to go by way of Sarajevo by road,
                    but in Sarajevo we were warned that the road trip was too long and too
                    dangerous. We had almost given up, in fact, we had given up on doing it, but
                    then when we got back to Sarajevo airport, Shattuck noticed that there were some
                    military helicopters parked on the ground there and he asked, “why can't we take
                    those helicopters?” We made a few telephone calls and amazingly, I don't know
                    how, but we ended up taking those helicopters. I don't remember whose
                    helicopters they were; they probably belonged to the UN forces, who I suppose
                    were the only people who would have had helicopters in Bosnia at the time. So,
                    we flew into Banja Luka, as the first official Americans to visit for a long
                    time, perhaps even since the start of the war. It was more symbolic than
                    anything else. We didn't really have any particularly useful meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the Dayton Accords?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think that was before the Dayton Accords. The Dayton Accords were a
                    little bit later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there what was the bureau view of what was
                        happening in Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was grave. Bosnia was one of the major human rights disasters of our
                    time and it was still going on, right in the heart of Europe. There were camps,
                    and murders and torture and ethnic cleansing and so forth. I guess our
                    perspective on stopping the war was to stop the human rights violations. We
                    wanted to ensure peace with justice, as opposed to a peace that forgave all of
                    the war criminals for things they might have done. We very strongly believed
                    that you would not have a lasting peace if you let all the war criminals off
                    scot free. So this made the negotiations much more difficult and made the human
                    rights bureau position within the Department not always quite so welcome
                    because, of course, it's hard to make peace with somebody if you're telling him
                    that he might go to jail as soon as he signs the peace treaty. Still, this did
                    come to be the U.S. position, to the extent that we established the war crimes
                    tribunal, without specifying in advance, of course, who the tribunal might
                    ultimately indict and how it might go about its work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of people that you and Shattuck
                        would meet on the various sides in Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>EICHER: They were tough cookies but they were not, all in all, all that
                    impressive from my perspective. We met with a few of the people who have ended
                    up convicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. I'm having trouble
                    recalling some of their names but there was a woman president of the Republica
                    Srpska, Mrs. Plavsic, I think, who subsequently pleaded guilty in The Hague and
                    is in prison. There was Kraisnic, I believe his name was, one of the Bosnian
                    Serbs who was the number two in the country, in fact, who also was convicted by
                    the tribunal. In general they seemed to be pretty sleazy characters. You could
                    imagine that they actually were responsible for what they were accused of doing.
                    We didn't meet with Karadzic or Mladic, of course; they were already off
                    limits.</p>
                <p>We met with Croatian and Serbian leaders as well, none of whom stand out
                    particularly in my mind. I remember being excluded from a meeting with Milosevic
                    on direct orders from Richard Holbrooke, who was the Assistant Secretary for
                    European Affairs. John Shattuck and I met with Holbrooke before taking the trip
                    out to meet Milosevic and Holbrooke told Shattuck, “You have to go absolutely by
                    yourself. The ambassador can join you, but nobody else is allowed in the
                    meeting.” I think this was in line with Holbrooke's generally secretive
                    style.</p>
                <p>In Bosnia, we also spent a lot of time meeting with the Red Cross and with the
                    nongovernmental organizations and others, which gave us a very grim view of some
                    of the things that had been done. A lot of this had already been in the
                    newspapers, but when something is in the paper it is sometimes put down to
                    rumor, while when the same thing gets reported by a senior American official it
                    starts to carry a bit more weight, so more and more we were able to get human
                    rights onto the political agenda. At Dayton, the agreement which was reached was
                    just full of human rights, as I've already said, and it required the parties in
                    Bosnia to accept a big range of human rights treaties and human rights
                    obligations, which was really quite something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was listening to a presentation last night and some were
                        saying some of the Dayton Accords essentially were rewarding Serbian
                        aggression. What was the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>EICHER: In a sense, perhaps. There is plenty of room to debate about the results
                    of Dayton. The discussion is ongoing. I think it was pretty close to the best
                    that could be achieved at the time. Remember, all the sides agreed to it. In
                    principle it didn't really yield to the Serbs in the sense that the right of
                    return for refugees and IDPs (internally displaced persons) was built in to the
                    accords, even if they were not fully implemented in practice. I believe that the
                    people who chose not to go back to their former places of residencwhich ended up
                    being most peoplwere compensated for their losses. Serbs who had occupied houses
                    belonging to other ethnic groups, and vice versa, were eventually pushed out or
                    made to pay compensation. That part of the treaty actually did work pretty well,
                    although it took a long time. Dayton didn't really create a unitary state, of
                    course, and that's the sense in which some people might say that it rewarded the
                    Serbs, since it divided Bosnia into different ethnic areas. But, the subsequent
                    negotiations, post-Dayton, which continued to develop the peace agreement,
                    forced Bosnia more and more toward becoming a unitary state. Dayton was the
                    framework that allowed that to happen, by essentially making Bosnia an
                    international protectorate headed by an internationally appointed High
                    Representative, who eventually was given dictatorial powers. So if there may
                    have initially seemed to be a reward for aggression, if you want to call it
                    that, it was pretty much undone in subsequent years by the international
                    administration. The moves toward a unitary state are continuing, and now you
                    have the ironic specter of the ethnic Serbs, who were pretty much forced into
                    the agreement, now talking about how they want to preserve Dayton, since its
                    terms are looser than the situation that has since evolved. These days, if you
                    drive through Bosnia you can't tell when you're passing the border between the
                    Republica Srpska and the other parts of Bosnia.</p>
                <p>Back at the time of Dayton, the international community still didn't want to
                    intervene militarily or to send a military force into Bosnia until after the
                    parties had agreed to a peace settlement. That limited international leverage
                    and forced compromises. So, on the one hand you had people saying that Dayton
                    rewarded Serb aggression and on the other hand you had people saying that the
                    peace was unworkable because the refugees would never go back to their homes and
                    it would have led to a stronger peace just to accept the reality of the
                    situation on the ground, partition the country and be done with it. Dayton was a
                    compromise. All in all, it worked pretty well, although Bosnia is still a
                    fragile place. Even going back half a dozen years later, when the peace was well
                    established, you could still see that the situation was fragile. People had a
                    stake in the peace, but some of the old animosities were still there. If the
                    international community didn't have a continuing presence there, it wouldn't be
                    too hard for the hotheads on all sides to stir up trouble again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find at Banja Luka when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>EICHER: We found a quiet little town, or city, I guess I should say, since I
                    think Banja Luka was the second largest city in Bosnia, even though it's not a
                    very big place. It was depressing in its own way, but not particularly
                    unpleasant. It was one of the places in Bosnia where there had not been active
                    fighting, so although it was suffering from an economic downturn and you could
                    see that it had not been kept up, there was not a lot of destruction in Banja
                    Luka as there was in many other parts of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had the mosque been destroyed at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The mosque had been destroyed, yes. That was the one gaping example of
                    destruction, and very sad, indeed that people felt like they needed to destroy a
                    mosque. There was a lot of destruction of religious buildings during the war. We
                    walked over and looked at the site where the mosque had been and there was
                    nothing but a vacant lot to be seen. We went and knocked on the door of the
                    imam's house, who still lived in Banja Luka, to see if we could meet him but we
                    were unsuccessful in that; he wasn't in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was collecting the evidence that eventually would be
                        turned over to the Hague Tribunal? Was this part of the human rights
                        mandate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We did not have people in Bosnia who were separately collecting anything
                    at the time. The U.S. representatives who were there at the embassthere was an
                    embassy by this timwould collect things as they were able to and send them on to
                    the Department. I believe the stuff ultimately did get to, in fact I know it
                    ultimately got to the proper authorities of the tribunal. The tribunal
                    eventually had its own investigators who took the lead in gathering
                    information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the human rights bureau did not have that mandate, not
                        only there but also in other places? I mean, was there another bureau doing
                        this for things coming out of Timor or Rwanda or Kosovo or all sorts of
                        other little places? In the State Department, was there any sort of office
                        that collected horror stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, we did collect horror stories in the next office I was in, when I
                    was director of the Office of Bilateral Affairs in DRL. That was really the
                    office in the Department responsible for tracking human rights violations, or
                    horror stories, if you want to call them that, all over the world. But we were
                    doing it as part of our own mandate to promote human rights, not as an adjunct
                    to war crimes tribunals. We would offer to share information with the tribunals,
                    but the kind of reports we had were not generally the kinds that could be used
                    effectively as evidence in prosecutions. We didn't generally track the names and
                    whereabouts of witnesses, or conduct in-depth inquiries into specific incidents,
                    or worry about chains of evidence. Our goal in collecting information was to
                    document and publicize abuses, as the first step in being able to take action to
                    stop abuses.</p>
                <p>Our primary source of information was embassy reporting, of course. Embassies
                    around the world are very good at producing good, reliable reports, including on
                    human rights problems, particularly if they deal with particular events, say a
                    massacre, or a race riot, or detentions of political activists. So the embassies
                    would provide good information on those kinds of high-profile human rights
                    issues, which you could also usually read about in the press. What we also did,
                    however, was to deal a lot with the NGOs (non-governmental organizations),
                    especially the human rights NGOs, so we would have a separate source of
                    information coming in from them. They regarded DRL very much as “their people”
                    within the State Department and tended not to have a lot of faith in the
                    geographic bureaus to act on the human rights information they supplied. They
                    would funnel the information to us and we would also always look at it very
                    carefully. Some groups had more credibility than others. Groups like Amnesty
                    International and Human Rights Watch tended to do very professional work; you
                    could trust the information they provided. There was also a lot of information
                    coming in from local human rights NGOs based in various countries but we had to
                    be more careful about them, since some of them might have a political agenda.
                    Still, you got to know which ones you could generally count on. We met regularly
                    with NGOs, both in formal groups and individually. We had a good relationship
                    with them.</p>
                <p>We would use all this information in preparing the Department's annual human
                    rights reports. The way the human rights reports were prepared was for the
                    embassy to prepare the first draft and send it to us in the human rights bureau.
                    I guess I should just say, parenthetically, that when I moved from special
                    assistant to be director of the Office of Bilateral Affairs (BA), at that point
                    it was BA that was still ultimately responsible for the human rights reports. So
                    I was very much involved in that process. The entire BA office was involved; it
                    would kind of take us over for several weeks of the year. There was also a big
                    “reports team,” generally made up of Department retirees, that would come on
                    board and do most of the day to day work and mechanics of putting the reports
                    together. The more controversial the content of a report was, the more I would
                    become involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>In any event, we would look at the first drafts prepared by the embassies and
                    compare them to the information we were getting all year long from NGOs, and if
                    the embassy report was quite different from what we were hearing from NGOeither
                    overall or on a particular issuwe would have a lot of tough questions for the
                    embassy and we might insist on changes to their draft. We often made changes
                    based on NGO information if we considered it sufficiently trustworthy.</p>

                        of nongovernmental organizations, NGOs? I mean, this is a relatively recent
                        phenomenon, with the State Department beginning to acknowledge this as being
                        another arm of the diplomatic world and part of its outreach.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I wasn't there at the creation, I guess I should say. I started to
                    encounter NGOs as a major part of my work while I was in Geneva, during my four
                    years at the UN, where the NGOs were very, very active. In fact, the UN has
                    something called “NGOs with consultative status with ECOSOC.” ECOSOC is the UN
                    Economic and Social Council and in the UN, human rights generally falls
                    organizationally under ECOSOC. So, there were a lot of human rights NGOs in
                    Geneva which already had consultative status and were already dealing with the
                    UN. Not every NGO could get this status. For a long time, Human Rights Watch was
                    excluded, due to opposition from the Cubans and some others, but we eventually
                    got Human Rights Watch approved.</p>
                <p>I found when I got to Geneva that the history of the U.S. relationship with NGOs
                    had not always been very good and or very close. NGOs can sometimes seem like a
                    pain. Most of them are strong-willed and outspoken. And, since they don't have a
                    vote in the UN, a lot of American officials had been inclined to write them off
                    as a waste of time. Human rights NGOs are crusaders, which are often very
                    critical of the U.S. as well as of other governments, and which are always
                    complaining about something. But you've got to realize that this is their role,
                    their raison d'etre. They're there to point out what's wrong and to advocate
                    improvements.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>I was among those who worked hard to improve the U.S. relationship with NGOs. I
                    have to say that Washington was actually an ally in this and encouraged it. In
                    Geneva, and later in Washington, we worked very closely with NGOs and found it a
                    very rewarding experience and very helpful to what we were doing. They were
                    almost always strong allies on whatever human rights issue we wanted to pursue.
                    They would often criticize us for not going as far on an issue as they would
                    have wanted, but they were pleased that we were doing serious things on human
                    rights. So, after working closely with NGOs in Geneva, when I got back to
                    Washington, it seemed natural to do a lot of work with NGOs there, which was
                    already an established practice in Washington. Shattuck himself met regularly
                    with leaders of NGOs as an organized group, as well as with individual NGO
                    leaders who would come in from time to time. They were quite important to what
                    we were doing and they provided a real check during the human rights report
                    process, to ensure that the information reported by embassies was complete and
                    accurate. The human rights NGOs also provided a very important early warning
                    system; very often we would hear first from NGO reports that there was this or
                    that kind of problem in this or that country, even before the embassy reported
                    on it. In some cases, we would ask an embassy to please look into this or that,
                    based on information from NGOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a list of NGOs to be listened to and NGOs to
                        be dubious about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: There was no specific list; certainly there was no “black list.” As I
                    said, there was a group of eight or ten of the major human rights NGOs with
                    offices in Washington that we met with regularly, but it wasn't an exclusive
                    list. In fact, they were self-organized to some extent and would have group
                    meetings at their offices, which I often attended. So those were the big
                    players. But, we listened to just about anyone who wanted to speak with us. As a
                    result, I did spend a lot of time with dubious or questionable NGOs. There were
                    some that we just gave less credibility to because the information they provided
                    contradicted what we heard elsewhere or when we asked the embassy to check
                    something, the embassy would carefully check and find that it wasn't true. There
                    were also lots of NGOs that had a political ax to grind and you had to keep in
                    mind that their information might be accurate, but it might also be a bit skewed
                    or be a cover for a political agenda. You know, NGOs whose goal was to promote
                    Kurdish independence, for example, or some of the Tibet NGOs or a whole range of
                    other organizations. That's not to say that they weren't good and professional,
                    but you just had to keep in mind what their political stance was and be a little
                    more careful with the kinds of information you were getting from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Cuba at all on our list or was this sort of a
                        perennial problem and we had almost a cut and dried report?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>EICHER: Cuba was always on our list and, in fact, there were always a certain
                    number of accepted “bad guys” on our list. You would see a striking difference
                    between the initial draft reports on countries like Cuba and Iraq and Iran and
                    North Korea, compared to reports on countries where we were trying to have good
                    relations. The initial drafts on Cuba and such would be extremely strong reports
                    from the field. In most countries, our problem with human rights reports was
                    that the fielthe embassiewas trying to water down or paper over the human rights
                    problems in their countries, or try to explain them away. In Cuba and these
                    other later, “axis of evil” countries, the reports that were coming in were very
                    tough in the first place. If we didn't have an embassy somewhere, then it was
                    the country desk that would put together the first draft of the report.</p>
                <p>One of the things we had to be careful about was balance. We worked with a lot in
                    the human rights bureau to try to ensure that when the same kind of human rights
                    violation was taking place in different countries, it was characterized the same
                    way in the human rights reports. Take political prisoners, for example. We
                    couldn't say that there are political prisoners in Cuba and talk about how
                    horrible that was and then take another country, say, Indonesia, where they also
                    had political prisoners, but say “well, they do have political prisoners, but
                    you have to understand the special circumstances and it's not really so bad
                    because of this or that.” We saw a lot of client-ism or “clientitis,” as we
                    called it. I mean, it was truly amazing, sitting in the DRL Office of Bilateral
                    Affairs, some of the things you would see coming in from our embassies. China
                    was one of the main, perennial examples of a truly terrible human rights
                    situation, with a report coming in from our embassy explaining why it really
                    wasn't so bad and you had to understand the context. We spent a lot of time in
                    bureaucratic battles over what language to use to describe the situation in
                    different countries. The battles that would get to my desk as office director
                    were the ones that became very controversial and had risen to a higher level. I
                    remember that I was involved in China, Indonesia and the Israeli occupied
                    territories, among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take China. Obviously, anything good or bad you can
                        say comes out of China. It's a vast country and it's got a dictatorial
                        regime which is kind of breaking apart. You've got war lords and you've got
                        corruption. I mean anything. How did you find the reporting from the embassy
                        and then the reporting of other groups, and how did we reconcile that, while
                        also considering American commercial interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>EICHER: In the human rights reports we did pretty well. Ultimately, it was the
                    human rights bureau that had the responsibility for the human rights reports.
                    The assistant secretary had to sign off on the reports and that gave us a lot of
                    leverage, much more than the bureau had on other policy issues. We could usually
                    win the bureaucratic battles around the human rights reports by insisting we had
                    to be consistent worldwide and insisting we had to be accurate. Only rarely
                    would bureaucratic disputes rise to the assistant secretary level. It was a good
                    feeling to win these bureaucratic battles. Overall, the annual human rights
                    reports were really very good reports. I know they were sometimes criticized by
                    NGOs as not being tough enough and that perhaps we might have been able to say
                    things different ways, but overall I was very proud of the human rights reports
                    we put out while I was in DRL. They won broad acceptance as perhaps the best,
                    most reliable compendium of information on international human rights. They were
                    a very valuable tool. Some people in the State Department and the embassies
                    thought that it was time to dispense with the reports, that they were more
                    trouble than they were worth, but I was a fan. The reports were a very valuable
                    addition to U.S. policy. I believe that the first steps towards ending human
                    rights violations is to acknowledge them and publicize them. The reports were
                    critical in accomplishing these first steps.</p>
                <p>Now, where we would run into bigger difficulties was not so much in the language
                    of the reportdespite our bureaucratic battles about thabut in dealing with the
                    policy consequences of the reports. From our perspective in the human rights
                    bureau, if there were serious and persistent human rights violations in a
                    country, this should affect U.S. policy towards that country. This led to
                    another set of bureaucratic battles, which sometimes, or most often even, we
                    would lose.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>So, on China, for example, to get back to your question, the Department would
                    finally agree to put out a very tough human rights report acknowledging very
                    widespread and serious violations of human rights in China. Then, there would be
                    very tough bureaucratic battles over what to do about it, if anything, and how
                    much emphasis to attach to human rights, as compared to trade and other issues,
                    when actually formulating policy. On China, this usually played out around two
                    or three different issues. One of these issues that we've already talked about a
                    lot was whether to sponsor a China resolution each year at the UN Commission on
                    Human Rights. This was still an annual battle while I was in DRL/BA. We would
                    usually win that one, but it was a pyrrhic victory, because the decision would
                    be made so late and so reluctantly that we couldn't mount an effective campaign
                    to get the resolution adopted. The other really big issue was MFN, most favored
                    nation trade status. At that time, there would be a big battle in Congress every
                    year about whether to renew China's most favored nation trading status with the
                    Untied States. The battle centered to a large extent around human rights and
                    whether we should be giving trade privileges to a major human rights violator.
                    Despite the DRL perspective, the Department always came down on the side of
                    renewing MFN, and even more, on wanting to give China permanent MFN status,
                    without the need for an annual vote in the Congress. On a really big issue like
                    that, trade trumped human rights. Eventually, China was given permanent MFN
                    status despite its continuing, serious, persistent human rights problems. China
                    was such a big issue that I had an officer in my office working full time on
                    China; it was the only country for which I had full-time officer; most of the
                    other officers were responsible for a full bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>But while China always seemed to be the biggest battle, there were lots of
                    others. There were, in fact, a lot of laws that restricted giving military
                    assistance, or even economic assistance, to countries that were human rights
                    violators. Most of these laws had waivers that could be invoked to give
                    assistance anyway, and we would get into bureaucratic battles about whether to
                    invoke waivers if the countries in question were clearly serious human rights
                    violators. There was one peculiar case that that sticks in my mind. There was a
                    big bureaucratic fight, I remember, over a couple of the Central Asian
                    countries, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. There was a badly written, or badly
                    thought-out, law that said we could not provide them with certain types of
                    assistance unless the State Department certified that they were making progress
                    on human rights. This was one of the only times I can remember having a policy
                    disagreement with John Shattuck. I advised him very strongly not to sign the
                    certification for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan because it seemed clear that they
                    were not making progress on human rights. But he was under extremely heavy
                    bureaucratic pressure to sign the certification anyway. As I recall, the import
                    of this badly written law was that the United States would not be able to
                    provide assistance for dismantling the remaining Soviet nuclear activities in
                    the two countries unless we could certify that they were improving respect for
                    human rights. It was a real catch-22, since if the countries are human rights
                    violators, then you should be working even harder to make sure they don't have
                    dangerous nuclear materials. I'll admit that I took a very hard-nosed stance on
                    this issue, which was unpopular with the Central Asia offices and the arms
                    control bureau, which could make a reasonable argument that from a policy
                    perspective that we should sign the certifications so that we could still work
                    on de-nuclearization. But I thought it would be a very bad precedent for DRL and
                    for human rights policy to actually sign a certification of human rights
                    progress where there was none, even in the interest of some other very worthy
                    policy goal. It would have been far better to go back to Congress and get them
                    to make a change to the bad law. But, the general view was that there wasn't
                    time for this or it wasn't worth the effort since the Department could solve the
                    problem itself by signing the certification and issuing a waiver. So, in the
                    end, Shattuck ended up signing the certifications that they were making progress
                    on human rights so the de-nuclearization programs could go forward, even though
                    it was quite a stretch, at best, to say they were progressing on human rights.
                    As we know, the human rights situation in the two countries continued to get
                    worse and worse in subsequent years.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>So, I guess that's a long answer to your question about how we balanced human
                    rights against trade and other issues in the policy process. There were battles
                    to be fought and decisions to be made in regard to different issues in different
                    countries. We won some, but most often, we lost. The power structure in the
                    Department was still very much with the geographic bureaus. The Department
                    leadership was talking a very strong line about human rights being central to
                    U.S. foreign policy, but when it came to the tough decisions, other issues
                    tended to trump human rights. I was disappointed with Madeleine Albright as
                    Secretary of State in this regard. When she was Permanent Representative to the
                    UN, we could always count on her for very strong support on virtually every
                    human rights issue. She was a strong supporter of the annual China resolution,
                    for example, and she was one of the real movers behind the creation of the
                    Bosnia war crimes tribunal. Even tactically, remember, she came down on the
                    right side when I needed approval to press ahead on tabling a resolution to
                    create a UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. So I was very pleased when she
                    became Secretary of State and had very high hopes that human rights issues would
                    increasingly dominate U.S. policy. Instead, you could see a discernable change
                    in her positions once she became Secretary. On China, for example, she no longer
                    gave the solid support we had come to expect from her. I guess, maybe, that's a
                    good example of “where you stand depends on where you sit.” As secretary, she
                    was either looking at the big picture in a different way, or she was under her
                    own pressures that made her adopt different positions than she had previously
                    taken. I could understand it, but I was disappointed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Israel? I mean the human rights thing? On the
                        one hand, you've got the Israeli lobby which says that everything is
                        sweetness and light and, on the other hand, the Israelis are actually doing
                        all sorts of things that are pretty, pretty nasty when you think about it;
                        grabbing territory and treating the Palestinians badly. This must've been a
                        real battle, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, somehow I don't remember Israel being as much of a battle as China
                    and Indonesia and some of the others. I don't remember exactly how that report
                    came out in the years I was there but I'm sure that it did list all of the
                    different transgressions the Israelis were doing. With Israel, you had a lot of
                    reasonable offsetting factors like a democracy that functions and a good legal
                    system and courts that sometimes overruled nasty practices, so the overall
                    report did not come across as negatively as many other countries. Still, I'm
                    sure there were very sharp criticisms of Israeli practices in the reports we
                    produced. But yes, there were also some differences over what language to use on
                    Israel. As far as taking any punitive action against Israel because of its human
                    rights practices, that was out of the question as far as U.S. policy went.
                    Occasionally we might make a public statement critical of Israel because of
                    something it dilike collective punishmentor we might try to lean on the Israelis
                    to release someone, maybe, but it was pretty mild kind of stuff, when it
                    happened at all. Israel was another good example of other policy considerations
                    taking precedence over human rights. The same was true for Egypt, by the
                    way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I suppose also by the time you were there these
                        things have been so honed in past bureaucratic battles that there was
                        already an understanding among the different bureaus about what was
                        generally acceptable to say and do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think that's probably the case. As far as the human rights reports
                    went, there were some things, some sorts of violations, that didn't really
                    change much from year to year in various countries, and for those, we could use
                    the previous year's language rather than having to go through a new bureaucratic
                    struggle. In fact, I recalnot particularly with Israel but with many reportthat
                    one of the problems we faced frequently was that a human rights issue might be
                    just as bad in some country one year as it had been the previous year, say,
                    torture or whatever the problem might have been, and yet there was a new
                    ambassador, or new political officer responsible for the content of the report,
                    and suddenly we'd get entirely new language coming from the embassy that would
                    try to minimize the problem. In those kinds of cases, we could insist on going
                    back to the previous year's language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself as these reports came in, looking
                        over your shoulder at the United States and what was happening in our
                        prisons? Because when you get right down to it, one could write pretty nasty
                        reports about a lot of things that were happening in the United States.
                        We're a big country and a lot of things happen here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Of course, we were much criticized around the world for reporting on what
                    everybody else was doing wrong but ignoring our own problems. We had a few stock
                    answers for that, although none of them were entirely satisfactory. The first
                    answer was, of course, that the law requiring us to write the human rights
                    reports did not apply to the U.S., so we had no authority to report on the U.S.
                    Second, of course, the State Department didn't have the information to report on
                    what was happening in the U.S.; we don't have embassies or consulates reporting
                    what's happening in the U.S. or a “U.S. desk” at the State Department following
                    developments here. Third, we'd say that the U.S. is the most open and most
                    reported on country in the world; the U.S. and international media is constantly
                    reporting on problems from prison conditions to racism, so it was not as if the
                    U.S. was hiding information or as if there was some lack of information that
                    would make it useful for us to produce a report on human rights in the U.S. They
                    were all good points, but I don't think they satisfied our critics.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>In fact, while I was in DRL, the situation started to change just a little bit,
                    giving us another argument. What had happened was that the United States had
                    finally ratified a couple of the big, international human rights treaties. The
                    first of them had been signed during the Carter Administration but were not
                    ratified for many years thereafter, until the first President Bush's
                    administration. In particular, we finally ratified the International Covenant on
                    Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which is probably the most important
                    international human rights treaty. That treaty requires signatories to report to
                    the United Nations every few years on their own human rights situations. So, the
                    first U.S. report to the UN on compliance with the ICCPR came out while I was in
                    the bureau. After that, when people said that the State Department didn't report
                    on human rights violations in the U.S., we could reply that, you know, the State
                    Department has no mandate to report on the United States, but we have reported
                    to the United Nations and the report is publicly available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who made the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I believe the report was drafted mainly by the Justice Department and it
                    was, as I recall, with State Department input coming largely from the Legal
                    Adviser's office. It was a long and complex report, not very user-friendly. But
                    it made a nice talking point for us to use when people complained that we didn't
                    report on ourselves. The ICCPR was also important because it symbolized that the
                    U.S. was finally getting on board with the international human rights treaty
                    system. There are about ten of these important UN treaties, and the U.S. has
                    been the only Western country reluctant to ratify them. We got a lot of
                    criticism for our reluctance, which, frankly, was justified. The Congress just
                    didn't like human rights treaties and the various administrations were unable or
                    unwilling to put much political pressure behind getting them ratified. As I
                    said, we finally ratified the ICCPR, and also the Convention against Genocide
                    and the Convention against Torture. But several other important ones were not
                    signed. For example, the U.S. never ratified the International Covenant on
                    Economic Social and Cultural Rights, which is the companion piece to the ICCPR.
                    We also never ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination
                    against Women, and we are one of only two countries in the world that hasn't
                    ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The attitude in the Congress
                    has been very parochia“we don't need foreigners telling us how to raise our
                    children” and other such nonsense, as if we were somehow threatened by human
                    rights instead of being the champion of human rights. As a result, the U.S. is
                    rather isolated in regard to international human rights treaties; we're well
                    behind the curve. It makes it difficult for us to insist that others adhere to
                    international standards when we haven't formally accepted them ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Rwanda?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>The Rwanda genocide happened while I was still in Geneva, before I got to DRL, as
                    we discussed earlier. While I was in DRL it was still high on our agenda, but in
                    terms of dealing with the aftermath. We were trying to set up the international
                    war crimes court for Rwanda, along the same lines as the one already established
                    for Bosnia. And, since only the top criminals would ever get before the
                    international court, we were trying to help rebuild the justice system of Rwanda
                    to deal with the others. There was a terrible situation on the ground, with
                    thousands of Hutus crammed into tiny prisons where there was barely room to
                    movliteralland no prospect of any of them going to trial since the justice
                    system had been decimated. There were all kinds of other problems stemming from
                    the genocide, as well. Armed Hutus had crossed into Congo and were causing havoc
                    there. There was a big issue that war criminals were probably hiding out in the
                    refugee camps in Congo and a lot of them were armed and conducting kind of a
                    reign of terror over the other refugees.</p>
                <p>Another thing I should mention that we were somewhat involved in was trying to
                    apprehend war criminals from both Rwanda and Bosnia and turn them over to the
                    court. We weren't actually doing the apprehending, of course, but we were
                    involved in trying to put together lists, and encouraging other countries to
                    cooperate when suspects turned up there, and making sure U.S. law enforcement
                    knew of the State Department position on these people so they would cooperate if
                    any of the suspects came to the U.S., which a couple did. We were involved in
                    getting a few Rwandans turned over to the court.</p>
                <p>On Bosnia, however, it was a sad situation. The worst of the war criminals were
                    still running around more or less openly and the U.S. military was saying that
                    it wasn't their job to arrest war criminals; they were afraid that going after
                    Bosnian Serb leaders would unhinge the peace. We had a very different view from
                    the Pentagon and were urging vigorous action. The White House, unfortunately,
                    came down on the Pentagon's side. I don't remember the exact details, but the
                    general policy was so restrictive that a war criminal would practically have to
                    walk into an American military base before he would be arrested. Eventually this
                    changed and the military adopted a more robust approach, but by that time the
                    ringleaders had gone underground.</p>
                <p>Back to Rwanda, we were also trying to get the United Nations to send a human
                    rights mission into Rwanda, and we ultimately succeeded in pushing the new High
                    Commissioner for Human Rights, Ayala-Lasso, to do this, partly by paying for
                    much of it and partly by helping set up the process and recruit the people. This
                    was the first ever UN human rights mission to a country, so it was
                    groundbreaking. Since then it's become a common practice to have UN human rights
                    missions in trouble spots. It was useful because you actually had monitors on
                    the ground, who were reporting and watching what was going on and might, by
                    their presence, deter some further outrages. But, by this time, the worst had
                    already passed in Rwanda. In a way it was closing the barn door after the horse
                    was gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Congo? Congo particularly at that time was
                        in a real state of turmoil, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was, yes. I was in DRL when Laurent Kabila launched his war against
                    Mobutu and eventually took over the Congo, in fact renamed it the Congo again,
                    rather than Zaire. This was part of an extremely tumultuous time in Central
                    Africa, with the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, and Rwandan troops running
                    around inside Congo pursuing Hutu militias, and Kabila's revolt against Mobutu,
                    plus a lot of unrest and revolt going on in Uganda and southern Sudan, as well.
                    It was a mess on many fronts and there didn't seem to be a lot that people could
                    do about it.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, one of the things that sticks in my mind the most is being
                    approached by an American woman whose husband had been kidnapped by Kabila when
                    he was a rebel leader and held for ransom. Now Kabila was head of state and she
                    was insisting that the United States should not be dealing with this person who
                    she considered to be an outlaw. I guess the U.S. had even called him that at one
                    point along the way. There wasn't much we could do from the human rights bureau
                    to help her, other than giving her my sympathetic ear, which, in fact, turned
                    out to be all she really wanted. As a head of state, Kabila would have had
                    immunity against any U.S. action even if the U.S. had wanted to do something,
                    which it did not.</p>
                <p>Another of the big issues that took a lot of my time, I recall, was arms sales.
                    It's interesting that human rights are taken into account when considering arms
                    sales, as a result of congressional action. Usually, when the human rights
                    bureau had some clout on an issue it was because the Congress had written some
                    law saying specifically that the human rights bureau must have a say in it, or
                    that the U.S. couldn't do this or that unless the human rights situation was
                    satisfactory. Or, if there wasn't a legal provision, it was often included in
                    the law's report language, so that the Department felt like it might get in
                    trouble with the Congress if it ignored the human rights bureau. There was a
                    legal provision that we should not sell military equipment to states which are
                    gross human rights violators or systematic violators; I can't remember the exact
                    language. There was also a provision that the president could waive the human
                    rights restrictions for national security reasons. So, we spent a lot of time
                    arguing with the other bureaus about whether we could sell F-16s, or whatever
                    military equipment, to country X or Y.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>Indonesia was one of the big countries that I spent a lot of time on, with the
                    East Asia Bureau, discussing arms sales. There were some very serious human
                    rights problems in Indonesia and we thought that under the circumstances, and
                    the law, we should not be selling arms to the regime there. The East Asia bureau
                    had the usual arguments about the country being a strategic ally. There was also
                    pressure from the Pentagon and a couple of congressmen, I think, because there
                    was also the potential for really big arms sales that they didn't want to lose.
                    We finally came up with a compromise where we permitted the sale of naval
                    vesselI think they wanted to buy a couple of destroyerbut prohibited the sale of
                    small arms and police equipment, including things like stun guns and handcuffs
                    and electric prods. The idea was that they weren't going to use battleships to
                    torture or oppress people, although you could still make the case that by
                    selling major military equipment, you were upholding an oppressive regime.
                    Nonetheless, we in the Human Rights Bureau found it to be a reasonable kind of
                    compromise since it was one of those unusual instances where we prevailed in
                    banning the sales of many types of equipment to a regime that might use it in
                    questionable ways. The Congress also seemed to think we had come up with a good
                    solution that more or less satisfied everyone.</p>
                <p>We didn't win too many of the arms sales battles but we did have a few victories.
                    In addition to Indonesia, I think we blocked some sales to Pakistan. We were
                    regularly overridden, however, on countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabithose arms
                    sales were so longstanding and broadly supported that I don't even remember
                    there being any more than cursory discussion about them.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>There was also a big Latin American arms sale issue that I was deeply involved
                    in. There was a new amendment to some law; I can't remember for sure what law it
                    was, but I think it was called the “Leahy amendment.” In any event, this
                    amendment said that the United States could not sell military equipment if it
                    might be used by specific units of foreign militaries that had been involved in
                    human rights violations. I can't remember if the amendment was applicable
                    worldwide or just to Latin America, but the focus was certainly Latin America
                    and, in particular, Colombia. Colombia was a very special and delicate problem
                    because the government was facing a huge threat from rebels who were also
                    narcotics traffickers, or associated with narcotics traffickers, supplying most
                    of the cocaine going into the U.S. The U.S. was supporting the government
                    against the rebels and the criminal drug cartels. But the Colombian government's
                    record was far from clean. There were government-supported paramilitary groups,
                    and some government troops, committing lots of horrendous human rights
                    violations. The Leahy amendment tried to get at the problem of supporting the
                    government but ending human rights violations by saying that even if we waived
                    existing human rights provisions against selling arms to Colombia, we would
                    still be prohibited from selling equipment that would be used by any unit of the
                    Colombian army that had been involved in human rights violations. This was kind
                    of a revolutionary proposal; it had never been tried before. So, we had to come
                    up with a system under which the embassies would actually be required to monitor
                    which U.S. weapons went to which units of a foreign military and to report on
                    which specific units of a foreign army might have been involved in atrocities.
                    This turned into quite a negotiation with both the Political Military Bureau
                    (PM) and the Latin American Bureau. At first, PM claimed to be the action bureau
                    and just stalled for a long time before producing a draft instruction that
                    really didn't do any more than inform posts about the new legal provision. I
                    finally had to come up with a new draft myself that instructed posts to put a
                    new tracking system into place and to get certifications from the host country
                    that our equipment would not go to specific units that we suspected of abuses,
                    and to monitor what units were getting what equipment, and then tracking the
                    behavior of units involved in the counter-insurgency. There was a lot of
                    resistance, especially from PM, but with the Latin America Bureau's general
                    support, that this would be too much work and that it wouldn't be practical, and
                    so forth. In the end, however, this was one that the Human Rights Bureau won by
                    virtue of saying “look, the Congress passed a law. We have to do it.” So I
                    worked on that and it was interesting. I felt a certain sense of accomplishment
                    after the new procedures were put into place. I don't recall exactly how it
                    turned out in practice in the short term, but I think it helped. If nothing
                    else, the Colombians knew we were looking over their shoulders in much greater
                    detail and there could be consequences unless they cleaned up their act. Over
                    the longer term, as I understand, they really did get a grip on the
                    paramilitaries and they have cleaned up their act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, weapons are fungible, as they
                        say.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, you could say that, yes. A country could give the U.S. equipment to
                    a “clean” unit and have them pass on their AK-47s to a unit we had blacklisted.
                    Anyway, every little bit helped, we thought.</p>
                <p>Beyond arms sales, we also got involved in a fair number of extradition cases.
                    The U.S. ratified the UN Convention Against Torture in the early '90what a
                    difference with the current Bush administration policieand one of the provisions
                    of the Convention was that signatories are not allowed send somebody back to a
                    country where they might be tortured. So, when there was a case where a country
                    asked the U.S. to extradite someone, the case might come to my office for a
                    determination of whether the individual to be extradited might face torture if
                    we sent him back to the country asking for extradition. We looked at these cases
                    and in some instances we advised that people should not be sent back to country
                    X or Y because we feared that there was, in fact, a legitimate chance that they
                    would be tortured when they got there, based on that country's past record. In
                    other cases, we accepted assurances from the host government that the person
                    would not be tortured and, in some of those cases, we asked our embassy to
                    follow up from time to time, to actually try to meet the person to ascertain
                    that in fact, he had not been tortured after he got there. As far as I can
                    recall, however, I don't think there was any systematic procedure for ensuring
                    that we were consulted on extraditions; I think it was ad hoc and may have
                    depended on how good a lawyer the accused person had.</p>
                <p>We occasionally also got involved in asylum cases. There was a separate Office of
                    Asylum within DRL that handled most asylum requests but when a case got big and
                    controversial, it would also come to Bilateral Affairs for our judgment on
                    whether the situation in some country was such that an asylum request might be
                    valid. We would provide our opinions to the asylum court judges, who would make
                    the decisions in individual cases.</p>
                <p>There were a number of other human rights issues that came up in the time that I
                    was in DRL as well. Human rights and the environment was always a controversial
                    issue within the Department. A lot of NGOs were advocating a “right to a healthy
                    environment.” The State Department legal office was usually vehemently against
                    recognizing any new rights and sometimes even seemed to want to minimize
                    existing rights; their goal was often to try to ensure that the U.S. didn't get
                    entangled in anything that would result in new legal obligations for the U.S.
                    that might be a problem at some point in the future. I should caveat that
                    because often these issues were so arcane that only a single lawyer in the Legal
                    Adviser's Office was involved, a single lawyer could cause lots of obstructions.
                    Most of the lawyers in the office were very strong advocates of human rights and
                    were a pleasure to work with. On the environment, however, the legal office was
                    reluctant for us to do anything. I formed a little working group that included
                    DRL, the legal adviser's office and the environment bureau, and were able to
                    hammer out a policy that put the U.S. more or less on the right side of the
                    issue, even while keeping the lawyers satisfied.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Freedom of religion was also becoming a huge issue. I was not in charge of that
                    one, but I was part of DRL's working group and was much involved in trying to
                    raise the profile of problems of persecution on the basis of religion. I think
                    this issue was driven at first by Congressional interest, which was sparked by
                    church groups. The bureau organized a panel of experts on freedom of religion,
                    including a number of very prominent American clerics from different
                    denominations. DRL also put out the first report on religious persecution while
                    I was there and, of course, I had to get involved in helping with that, even
                    though I was not the lead. This continued to grow after I left DRL and now
                    there's a much bigger, more structured, annual report on religious freedom, as
                    well as a special ambassador on religious freedom.</p>
                <p>Another issue that was started to emerge as a big human rights issue while I was
                    in DRL was female genital mutilation. This had been an issue for a long time, of
                    course, but it wasn't one that got a lot of publicity or that the U.S.
                    previously had an official position on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was done particularly in Africa. I ran across it a
                        bit in the Persian Gulf area. I'm not sure it's still an issue there but it
                        had been at one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was a big issue in Africa and the Middle East and one that the United
                    States was really starting to get active on. It was not a religious issue,
                    fortunately, but a cultural and traditional practice, which made it easier to
                    work on, although it was still a sensitive subject in many countries. We started
                    to publicize the issue and to be critical of countries where it was a common
                    practice, trying to encourage them both through shame and through public health
                    programs to adopt policies which would try to put an end to this. Women's
                    rights, in general, in fact, were quite a big issue while I was in DRL. Among my
                    other hats, I was head of the Bureau's working group on human rights of women.
                    We tried to find various ways to advance women's rights. In fact, I think the
                    very first thing I did when I got to the Bureau was immediately to run off to
                    Beijing to attend the 1995 UN World Conference on Women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hillary Clinton went to that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Hillary Clinton went to that, indeed. She was the leader of the U.S.
                    delegation and she made quite a splash and a very good impression with her work
                    there. She was seen as a real hero by most of the women in attendance. I was
                    working primarily with Geraldine Ferraro, who was one of the deputy leaders of
                    the American delegation. She's the one who asked me to join the delegation. You
                    might recall that I had worked as her deputy in Geneva, when she was ambassador
                    to the Human Rights Commission. So, I spent two or three weeks in Beijing, in
                    one of these massive multilateral negotiations, trying to put together the
                    Beijing Declaration and Program of Action.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain your impression, what were some of the
                        issues, how were the Chinese as the hosts and some of the other delegations?
                        How did this whole thing work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: For me it was very familiar territory. It was a big UN conference, not so
                    different from the World Conference on Human Rights, which I had participated in
                    a couple years earlier in Vienna. In fact, there were a lot of the same issues
                    and a lot of the same people were there, so I felt very much at home. We were
                    working towards a similar goal, to try to get an international consensus on a
                    single document with a broad set of issues. This time, of course, the document
                    was on women rather than on human rightthe themes were “equality, development
                    and peace” but lots of the issues were really human rights issues. By the time
                    we got to Beijing, there was already a pretty good outline or draft of the
                    program of action, which ran on for two hundred or so pages. It set out all
                    kinds of things that countries, NGOs, and international organizations ought to
                    do in a whole range of fields to promote a better life for women. It covered
                    health issues, economic development, education, physical protection, and a lot
                    of other issues, including women's rights. Women's empowerment was a big
                    theme.</p>
                <p>Unlike the World Conference on Human Rights, where the preparatory phase took
                    place in Geneva and I was involved in the negotiations from the very beginning
                    of the preparations until the end of the conference, on the women's conference I
                    really came in at the tail end of the negotiations, which had been held in New
                    York. The Beijing conference was the final phase, where the delegations had to
                    wrap up all the details and reach agreement on the most controversial issues,
                    those on which there had not been consensus yet. What I personally ended up
                    spending most of my time on in Beijing was what came to be called the “Beijing
                    Declaration.” The pre-Beijing negotiations had developed this very nice, lengthy
                    program of actiowhich still had a number of controversial points but which was
                    in reasonable shapbut nobody had done anything about a preamble or a lead-in
                    document. I was assigned to be the negotiator for the preamble, which would say
                    that “we, the representatives of all countries in the world, are gathered in
                    Beijing with the following goals and we want to ensure X, Y, and Z for women
                    everywhere.” This would be the “Beijing Declaration,” which would be a general
                    statement of goals and principles, just a couple of pages long. The outcome of
                    the conferencthe document adopted therwas called the “Beijing Declaration and
                    Program of Action,” being a combination of the document I worked on and the much
                    longer program of action I mentioned before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In many ways the Declaration is the equivalent to the
                        executive summary and really, the only thing that almost anybody will ever
                        read?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, in a sense that's right, although the long Beijing document was, in
                    fact, read by many, many people and even became sort of the Bible for the
                    international women's movement for the next several years. But the casual reader
                    might not get any further than the Declaration. It was sort of a microcosm of
                    all the big issues that were included in the program of action, but in more
                    general terms. And since we had to use much reduced language, it made for a new
                    negotiation on many of the key points as well as some extraneous ones, as each
                    delegation tried to get its favorite political points included. There was even
                    some language on arms control and disarmament included.</p>
                <p>Since the Declaration was really an important part of the outcome, I was
                    surprised that it seemed to be an afterthought and that no one had started
                    working on a draft before we actually assembled in Beijing. I was also surprised
                    that with such a big, high-powered delegation, I was the one who ended up doing
                    most of the Declaration. With my human rights background, I spent most my time
                    trying to get human rights clauses into it. With the help of a lot of the
                    Europeans and others, the Beijing Declaration was very heavily human
                    rights-focused, with many paragraphs dealing with the rights of women. So we
                    found that to be a very nice victory. On the whole, the Declaration was pretty
                    good, as were the results of the conference in general. Although there were a
                    lot of controversial issues, all in all the delegations wanted to do the same
                    kinds of things and the negotiations in general were not nearly as hard fought
                    as at other international negotiations I've been involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the basic issues you had to deal with and who
                        were the prime either opponents or obstructionists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>EICHER: In my negotiation, the main issues that seemed to spark controversy were
                    really various human rights issues. Some of the countries with big human rights
                    problems wanted to avoid human rights issues to the extent possible, and that
                    made me and like-minded delegations even more determined to include as much as
                    possible. I found myself in a very strong negotiating position because just a
                    couple of years before, at the World Conference on Human Rights, these countries
                    had agreed to a lot of principles and language that they didn't like very much
                    and it became very awkward for them to try to say two years later that “well, in
                    the context of women, we really don't believe these things anymore.” So,
                    overall, it worked pretty well on the human rights front. We also had to do a
                    reprise on a number of different issues. As I said, the Declaration was
                    wide-ranging and touched on a lot of issues, from poverty eradication to arms
                    control, but most of the language was pretty bland. At the very end, a couple of
                    the members of the U.S. delegation decided they didn't like the language on
                    environment and economic growth, which was really quite innocuous but didn't
                    include some catch phrase they would have liked. Since the language in question
                    had already been adopted, this led to a long negotiation on a new, additional
                    paragraph in which many delegations tried once again to include all of their
                    favorite issues. So, if you ever look at the Declaration, you'll see that one of
                    the last paragraphs is very long and convoluted compared to the rest of the
                    document, and includes all kinds of issues that don't fit neatly together, and
                    is a bit out of sync with the rest of the Declaration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was birth-control an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Birth control was an issue. It was not really my issue, so I was not
                    involved in the negotiations on that and can't tell you much about how they
                    went. I do know that “women's reproductive rights,” as the issue was referred
                    to, was a big, controversial issue and there were a lot of people spending a lot
                    of time negotiating on it. This being the Clinton Administration, we didn't have
                    to worry about the so-called “Mexico City Policy” from the Regan administration.
                    The United States was taking a progressive view on women's reproductive rights
                    but a lot of countries were not. It made for a strange set of alliances, since
                    most of the Latin American countries, which usually side with us on human rights
                    issues at these big conferences, are very Catholic and had positions that were
                    strongly anti-abortion. China, on the other hand, which is usually against us on
                    human rights issues, is very pro-abortion. So sometimes it was strange
                    bedfellows. But, eventually they came up with some compromise language that
                    everybody could accept. I cannot recall exactly what it was. In the Declaration,
                    which I was working on, we did work out some language about the right of women
                    to control their own fertility, which was positive, but it was very brief and
                    didn't specifically mention abortion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the trafficking of women? We talked about this
                        before but was this an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>EICHER: It was an issue and it did come up. But, I think this was one of those
                    issues where everybody was basically in agreement that it is a problem and we
                    need to try to do something about it. So, it wasn't an issue of controversy, as
                    far as I can recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, I guess it would be a little hard to say
                        “free trade” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes. One issue that was very controversial, which had an interesting
                    outcome was the question of inheritance rights for women. This got to be a big
                    issue with the Islamic countries because Islamic law, sharia, sets out very
                    specifically what women are entitled to inherit and it's not equal to what men
                    get. So the Islamic countries were opposed to the right to inherit equally.
                    Geraldine Ferraro was the one who was working on this issue for us and I
                    remember her describing the difficulties in finding a compromise. Eventually,
                    the solution worked out in the conference document approved women's “equal right
                    to inherit” rather than their “right to inherit equally.” The upshot was that
                    everybody has an equal right to inherit, whether they're men or women, but they
                    don't necessarily get to inherit the same amount. The U.S. delegation accepted
                    this, as everyone else did. In fact, in a way it does reflect U.S. practice.
                    Gerry Ferraro explained that “look, you know, if I want to leave all of my
                    wealth to my son or leave it all to my daughter that should be my choice. I
                    shouldn't be forced by some international standard to divide things up equally
                    if I don't want to. They should all have an equal right to inherit, but that
                    doesn't mean they should always inherit equally.”</p>
                <p>Another big issue was the idea of “cultural relativism” or “particularities,” as
                    it was called in the human rights context, which had been one of the most
                    difficult issues at the Vienna conference a couple of years before. The argument
                    on this was over how much you had to take into account a country's cultural
                    traditions and historical background in the context of human rights or women's
                    rights. That is, if a country doesn't have a Western-type democratic tradition,
                    do the same “Western” standards apply to it? Or, is it OK to treat women
                    differently in countries with a long tradition of treating women differently? In
                    fact, we had already pretty much won that battle in Vienna at the World
                    Conference on Human Rights, but we had to fight it again in Beijing. We ended up
                    with even slightly better language than we had in Vienna. Everybody ultimately
                    agreed again that yes, every country's history and cultural traditions were
                    important, but regardless of what their traditions may be, all countries are
                    obliged to accept and to adhere to a common set of international standards on
                    human rights and women's rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the performance of Hillary
                        Clinton, seeing as now she's in a prime position to be the Democratic
                        candidate in the 2008 elections? We don't know how that will come out as we
                        talk, but how was her work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>EICHER: She was very popular. She gave her keynote address and it was standing
                    room only. She brought the house down. Generally people don't listen to speeches
                    at these conferences, but everyone was very intent on hers. People were
                    applauding and giving standing ovations. She was extremely impressive as the
                    public face of the delegation. She was not there the entire time. It was a long
                    conference, as I said, two or three weeks. This included a pre-conference
                    negotiating week. I think she was there for a week or less and I don't recall
                    her being involved in the negotiations at all. But everyone wanted to meet her
                    and I'm sure she used her meetings to press for the U.S. positions on various
                    issues.</p>
                <p>The U.S. slogan for the conference was “human rights are women's rights and
                    women's rights are human rights.” We worked hard to get that into the
                    Declaration as well, to get that phrase in. I guess that was an example of what
                    I mentioned before, about every delegation trying to get their favorite language
                    into the Declaration. We ran into a lot of resistance from people who said this
                    is just a slogan and doesn't really mean anything. Those were mainly the
                    delegations who always oppose the U.S. on everything. We ended up getting half
                    of it in but I can't remember whether it was women's rights are human rights or
                    the other way around, but one of them is actually in the Declaration.</p>
                <p>Hillary was regarded as one of the heroes of the conference, a very strong U.S.
                    voice to try to ensure that the right things came out. On a day to day basis,
                    the delegation was led primarily by Donna Shalala, who was the secretary for
                    health and human services at the time, and by Tim Wirth, who was the
                    undersecretary of state for global affairs. Tim was a very good guy and did much
                    of the day to day management and coordination of the delegation. Madeleine
                    Albright was also there for at least part of the conference; she was still UN
                    ambassador at the time. It was a huge American delegation. I think every woman
                    in the United States wanted to get on to it. There must've been eighty or a
                    hundred people on the delegation. Most were private individuals, some of whom
                    seemed just to be along for the ride. Those of us from the State Department were
                    definitely in the minority. We felt like we did most of the work, of course, and
                    all of the reporting. I think there were three or four of us who traded off
                    doing the daily reporting cables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the idea of China and women's rights and all the
                        leaders. Did you find yourself in a position of trying to herd a passel of
                        kittens or something or that wasn't your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Fortunately, that wasn't my job, as it had been when big delegations came
                    to Geneva. In fact, and to the credit of who ever put the Beijing delegation
                    together, most of them were very good, solid people, even though very few had
                    any background in international negotiations. A lot of them weren't even very
                    interested in the negotiations and although some were very good, others were
                    more what we might have called “women's rights tourists,” who were really there
                    for the ride and the experience, and who didn't contribute much, as far as I
                    could see.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>There was a huge “NGO forum” attached to the conference, which the Chinese had to
                    set up. This was a requirement for any UN international conference because the
                    UN tries to be NGO-friendly and a number of NGOs do have official, consultative
                    status with the UN. There were thousands of NGO participants there, from
                    hundreds of women's groups and other interested groups from all over the world.
                    At past conferences, like in Vienna, the NGO forum was set up on the same
                    premises where the governments were meeting, or nearby. Beijing was very
                    controversial because the Chinese set up the NGO conference not contiguous with
                    the main conference but in a separate town in the suburbs. The Chinese said this
                    was for logistical reasons, to give a better, more spacious and more open venue,
                    but most of the NGO participants viewed it as an effort to sideline the NGOs in
                    an out-of-the-way place where they would be easier to control, less likely to
                    influence the government delegations, less likely to be able to do anything
                    disruptive, and less likely to come into contact with everyday Chinese. So, they
                    set up this big sort of NGO village out in Wairu, a suburb that was, I don't
                    know, maybe twenty or thirty miles, an hour's bus trip, away from the
                    conference. Most of the so-called “public delegates” on the U.S. delegatiothat
                    is, the delegates who were not full-time employees of the State Department or
                    other U.S. government agenciewanted and liked to spend their time out in Wairu,
                    hobnobbing and networking with the NGOs, rather than asking to be in the
                    nitty-gritty of the negotiations that were taking place at the conference site.
                    I visited Wairu once or twice and it was a very interesting and actually nicely
                    set up, administratively. There was a very active, very large group of
                    organizations out there promoting all their various causes, holding seminars and
                    handing out literature. But it was very strange because you had all these
                    hundreds of organizations promoting their causes to each other, instead of
                    promoting them to the delegates who were actually writing the conference
                    documents and doing the negotiations. They were so isolated. They didn't seem to
                    me to have much influence on the negotiations. I don't recall any NGOs being
                    involved in the declaration negotiations in Beijing. A lot of them had clearly
                    done a lot of work during the preparatory phases, since many of their issues
                    were already incorporated in the draft program of action that we started with
                    when we got to Beijing. Some of the biggest, most serious ones were very unhappy
                    at being stuck in Wairu. But, in general, Wairu seemed to me to be more of a
                    huge, happy convention, with lots of like-minded people celebrating women's
                    empowerment, with sort of a party atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the Chinese handled this
                        whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>EICHER: They were very, very intent on having a successful outcome to the
                    conference and being seen as good hosts, so they were positive; they were
                    flexible. Everybody was a little bit irritated about this Wairu business for the
                    NGOs but eventually the internationals more or less rolled over on that and
                    stopped complaining about it. With that major exception, I think the Chinese
                    bent over backwards not to be obstructionist on any kind of substantive issue. I
                    don't remember them taking an active part in the negotiations, although their
                    delegates were there in force. Actually, it was refreshing to see the Chinese
                    being cooperative instead of obstructionist. They were desperate to have a
                    successful conference, at which everybody agreed to something; that seemed to be
                    far more important to them than exactly what was agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a male, did you feel that you were a bit of a fish out
                        of water? I'm not sure that's the right simile but, anyway, were there
                        proponents saying by God, only women should write this document on women or
                        something like that? Was that an issue or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: No, that wasn't an issue. It certainly was overwhelmingly women who were
                    at the conference, which is not surprising, I suppose. In fact, I remember
                    walking in the first day of the conference with Gerry Ferraro and her saying
                    something like, “holy shit, look at the number of women!” So, for people like
                    Gerry who had spent much of their lives blazing trails as the first woman in
                    this or that, it was quite striking to see a UN conference so dominated by
                    women. But, there were enough men there that you didn't feel really out of
                    place. In fact, as I said, it was also a lot of the same people who had been
                    negotiating with me at the World Conference on Human Rights, so I found a lot of
                    friends or colleagues from various countries, both men and women. In fact, I
                    think a number of women were probably disappointed that there weren't more men
                    there. Among women activists, there was a realization that you're not going to
                    be effective promoting women's empowerment or women's rights by working only
                    with women. You also have to get the men to buy into the concepts for it to be a
                    really successful effort. So I didn't find any problem in that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of an international team that you could
                        join up with, sort of a human rights team, I'm thinking maybe the British or
                        the Scandinavians, or what have you, a group that sort of represented a core
                        of the same basic interests that could work as a team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Absolutely. In fact, since this was a UN conference, there was the same
                    kind of geographical breakdowns, or subgroups, that I was so familiar with from
                    Geneva. There was a so-called WEOG, the Western Europeans and others group,
                    which would meet regularly to coordinate positions for the conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the “OGs”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>EICHER: The “others,” the OGs if you want, are the United States and Canada, plus
                    Australia, New Zealand and Japan. There was a little bit of a twist in Beijing,
                    since the EU had gotten its act a little more together since the World
                    Conference on Human Rights. By the time of the Beijing conference, the Europeans
                    were spending most of their time coordinating among themselves, leaving out the
                    rest of us non-Europeans. In fact, we had another very interesting little group
                    that used to get together regularly in Beijing to coordinate positions. It was
                    called JUSCANZ (pronounced “juice cans”), which are the initials of the
                    countries, Japan, U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This was basically
                    the “leftovers” of the WEOG. Japan was officially part of the Asian group, but
                    it tended to have positions in common with the WEOG, so it sat informally in
                    WEOG meetings, as well as in JUSCANZ. So we met with the JUSCANZ quite regularly
                    to share information, coordinate positions and share some of the work.</p>
                <p>In general, the dynamics of the conference were also interesting. I've mentioned
                    the strange alliances on the abortion issue. In Beijing, the African countries,
                    which were mainly represented by prominent women from their capitals who may or
                    may not have had much influence with their governments back home, tended to take
                    very activist, progressive points of view. This was a real contrast to what we
                    usually found from the Africans in human rights negotiations. The African women
                    were tremendous allies on almost every issue. It made us think they were
                    freelancing, that had there been a regular, government delegation, then the
                    countries' positions would have been much different. But we were very happy to
                    work with them.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Latin American delegations, the Latin American women, were
                    much tougher to deal with on a number of issues, primarily because of their
                    conservative, Catholic background on reproductive rights. In other negotiations
                    we had usually counted on the Latins to be our allies and would have a hard time
                    with the Africans. So it was an interesting, different dynamic.</p>
                <p>When I got back to Washington, one of the things I tried to do out of the Human
                    Rights Bureau, in my capacity as head of the Bureau's working group on human
                    rights of women, was to try to make sure that there was some kind of effective
                    follow up to the conference. We were able to get the Secretary to send a cable
                    to all diplomatic posts instructing them to follow up with their host country
                    and listing a number of different issues that we felt they ought to pay special
                    attention to and work on, especially with the people who had been members of the
                    Beijing delegations. We hoped we could start to build a new dynamic at American
                    embassies that women's empowerment issues, such as the ones we worked on at
                    Beijing, were issues that were appropriate and worthy for attention by American
                    embassies. All this was part of what we called “mainstreaming” women's issues
                    into foreign policy. As far as I could tell, most posts didn't take it too
                    seriously at first. A year later, on the anniversary of the conference, I did
                    another, all-diplomatic-posts instruction, asking our embassies to follow up on
                    how well their host countries were doing in implementing their Beijing
                    commitments. So, we were starting to build a new mentality in the State
                    Department as well as around the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these instructions basically asking our embassies to
                        work with the NGOs within the countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Not just the NGOs, but even more so with the governments. We actually
                    sent each embassy a list of their country's delegation members, in case they
                    didn't have it, including both government people and NGOs. We asked the
                    embassies to make contact with these people and to try to work with them to
                    build on the momentum created at Beijing. We would ask, for example, that the
                    embassy call on the minister of social affairs or whoever was in the country's
                    delegation at Beijing, and remind her or him that they had approved this big
                    plan of action, so what was being done to implement it? So that was a good
                    process. Again, we had no easy way of telling what kind of specific concrete
                    actions were being taken in specific countries by either the host governments or
                    by our embassies. Reporting was very sporadic. I don't believe most of our
                    embassies had sufficiently accepted that women's empowerment or women's rights
                    should be a substantial issue of U.S. foreign policy. But at least we were
                    making a start in that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course one looks at diplomacy. It's a cumulative
                        effect. I mean, people slaving away at things like human rights and, well,
                        all sorts of things. And, at a certain point, these issues get absorbed into
                        the ethos of things, both of the countries we're working on and our own,
                        too. We look at things quite differently over time. The same way that today
                        if I see somebody smoking, I find myself raising my eyebrows, whereas I used
                        to smoke myself. Countries change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I think that's right. I hope we were making a contribution and
                    helping to change things. At a minimum, for some people, we were bringing a lot
                    of issues to their attention for the first time and for others we were
                    reinforcing something that they already knew. I mentioned the worldwide
                    instructions from the secretary of state that I drafted. I was quite proud of
                    initiating that idea and doing that. Even if it didn't have any immediate impact
                    on U.S. foreign policy, it did lay the groundwork that these are important
                    issues, things that U.S. embassies should be trying to work on. If any embassy
                    wanted to spend time and resources on it, they no longer had to explain or
                    justify why; they had an instruction telling them it was U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your diplomatic skills. You know, these
                        international organizations are all very nice, but the real diplomacy is
                        from one bureau to another. How did you find dealing with particularly the
                        geographic bureaus? Did you have any difficult bureaus, any good bureaus?
                        Were there any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>EICHER: I think it was pretty tough all around. The geographic bureaus tended to
                    be very protective of their territory and their policies. The functional bureaus
                    in general, and the Human Rights Bureau in particular, I think, were seen not
                    only as backwaters but as interlopers. From the perspective of the geographic
                    bureaus, we never sufficiently understood the strategic context or the local
                    circumstances in whatever country we were dealing with, even if it was a country
                    we had visited or served in ourselves. They thought that the functional bureaus,
                    especially human rights, never took broader U.S. interests into account and so
                    forth and so on. There were a lot of bureaucratic battles, several of which I
                    already described to you, occasionally even resulting in a so-called “split
                    memo.” These were decision memos that would have to go up to the under secretary
                    for political affairs, or even to the secretary of state, to make the final
                    decision when there was a dispute among bureaus on whether we should adopt one
                    policy course or another. The human rights bureau usually lost on these. Just
                    the fact that the memos went to “P,” the undersecretary for political affairs,
                    who was in charge of the geographic bureaus, rather than to “G,” the
                    undersecretary for global affairs, who was in charge of the functional bureaus,
                    tells you a bit about where the power lay.</p>
                <p>One of the many battles we had, the annual dragged out, knuckles bared fight on
                    the China resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission was probably the worst. I
                    was carrying a lot of the water for the Human Rights Bureau on this, along with
                    John Shattuck, certainly, and others. It was an extremely frustrating effort.
                    Ultimately, we did win this one every year I was there, at least in the sense
                    that we did co-sponsor a China resolution each year at the Commission. But the
                    China desk, through its bureaucratic maneuvering, was able to ensure that we did
                    not do it effectively or vigorously enough. The position which was ultimately
                    adopted by the U.S. just about every year was that “we'll see how the situation
                    is at the time the Commission meets and make our decision when the time comes.”
                    This has a certain logic in the sense that you can hold the threat over the
                    Chinese and that perhaps they'll come up with some prisoner releases or
                    something in exchange for us dropping the resolution. But, in terms of actually
                    getting a resolution adopted, if you wait until the Human Rights Commission
                    starts to decide whether you want to do a resolution on China, you've missed six
                    months of trying to build political support for a resolution. The practical
                    result was that since China never did enough, we had our embassies around the
                    world rushing in at the last moment saying, “Oh, we just decided that the
                    situation is still bad in China and you should vote for a resolution.”
                    Meanwhile, the Chinese had been spending the entire year with high-level
                    delegations to every member of the Human Rights Commission lobbying against a
                    resolution. So it was a very poor, very frustrating bureaucratic process indeed.
                    Although this was one of the bureaucratic battles we won, it was a hollow
                    victory in the sense that while we sponsored a resolution, we never launched an
                    effective campaign to get one adopted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see in the time you were there any change in the
                        Chinese attitude toward human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>EICHER: Very little. There was a progression going on in China. You couldn't deny
                    that the country was changing, and changing in a positive way. Certainly there
                    was more individual freedom in some ways as the Chinese political system became
                    less totalitarian. But this was individual freedom in the social sense more than
                    the political sense. As long as people refrained from criticizing the political
                    system and stayed out of politics, as long as they avoided criticizing the
                    government, as long as they didn't ask to be in a labor union that was
                    independent, as long as they were satisfied with state-controlled churches, as
                    long as they didn't openly advocate anything that was against government policy,
                    then yes, they were freer to choose what job they wanted to have or where they
                    wanted to live. These were important things, even though they were limited.
                    China even started experimenting with village elections for the first time,
                    which had the potential to become something very significant, although they had
                    not yet become very widespread. So, yes, there were some changes and some
                    positive things going on. It was really in terms of political rights, like
                    freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of association, and
                    political prisoners that things were still going badly. China still had a huge,
                    pervasive, system of political detention, “reeducation through labor” camps,
                    where tens of thousands of people every year would be sentenced for terms
                    lasting years, without any kind of a trial, just an administrative procedure. So
                    there was change and some hopeful signs, yes, but still really enormous human
                    rights problems.</p>
                <p>One of the things I did while I was in DRL was a human rights mission to China. I
                    went to Beijing again, along with one of the deputy assistant secretaries for
                    the Asia Bureau, Jeff Bader, and the head of Chinese affairs in the National
                    Security Council, whose name I'm afraid I can't remember. We went a few weeks
                    before the Human Rights Commission, to talk with the Chinese to see if we could
                    get them to agree to do a few positive things in exchange for us not sponsoring
                    a resolution against them. This was a very interesting trip out there, as well
                    as a very grueling trip. We flew out, spent two days on the talks and then
                    turned around and flew back. We had good, serious talks. We were pushing for the
                    release of specific political prisoners, and pushing them to sign and ratify
                    some of the major human rights treaties. We also wanted China to open its
                    prisons to visits by the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) and to
                    let up on persecution of Christians. I can't remember exactly what else was on
                    the agenda; there were a couple of other items but those were the biggest ones.
                    We spent two days talking with the Chinese about these things. They occasionally
                    tried to say these were internal affairs, but we could beat them back from that.
                    Occasionally, they would point out that the U.S. also had serious problems of
                    human rights, which we didn't try to deny. In the end, we did not come away from
                    our meetings with any kind of agreement. Eventually, as before every meeting of
                    Human Rights Commission, they did release a couple of prisoners. But, they never
                    were willing to do what we regarded as the bare minimum to not sponsor a
                    resolution. Still, releasing a few prisoners did get them some votes from other
                    delegations, so they were achieving their objective.</p>

                        liberals on one side and Neanderthal, right wing Republicans on the other
                        side? I mean, going after you and the human rights bureau? How did you find
                        Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Congress was generally a big ally of the human rights bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They started it. I mean, people think Carter did, but it
                        was actually Congress that kicked the human rights report off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: And they still were big supporters when I was in DRL. To the extent we
                    had leverage within the State Department, it tended to be because Congress had
                    legislated or declared that human rightand DRL in particulahad to be taken into
                    account and had to be part of the policy process. We did have a number of
                    congressmen who were real allies and we had the general sympathy of practically
                    everybody in Congress, as far as I can recall. There was a Congressional Human
                    Rights Caucus that we dealt with fairly regularly. Tom Lantos, I believe, was
                    the chairman at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That's right, and he was very helpful on many issues. Interestingly, some
                    of the very right wing Republican members of Congress were very libertarian and
                    very supportive of human rights. Congressman Chris Smith, who is one of the most
                    conservative members of Congress, was one of the most active proponents of human
                    rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: He's a Republican from New Jersey. We could usually count on him to
                    support us on big human rights issues. I remember him at the Beijing Conference
                    complaining that we weren't taking tough enough positions on this or that.
                    Occasionally, say on the abortion issue, we would disagree, but on most basic
                    human rights and civil liberties issues, many right wing Republicans tend to be
                    very strong supporters of individual rights and liberties, both at home and
                    abroad. In fact, at the moment, with what's going on in the United Stateall the
                    wire tapping and detention without triaI'm very disturbed because some of them
                    don't seem to be standing up in the way they traditionally have for individual
                    freedoms here in our own country.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>Congressman Wolf of Virginia, another Republican, was another strong supporter.
                    He was very active on human rights issues. He was very supportive in Congress. I
                    didn't deal a lot of with Congress myself but I did go up a few times to speak
                    with congressmen or staffers about particular issues or particular countries.
                    Arms sales to Indonesia was one of the issues, I remember. The Indonesia office
                    director was going to brief somebody on the Hill, who insisted somebody from the
                    human rights bureau also come along and join the briefing so that they could be
                    sure and get a balanced view. Of course, it wasn't as if I was going to start a
                    debate with my colleague from the desk right there in the congressman's office;
                    we ironed out our position carefully in advance. But it was an indication of how
                    much Congress did support our efforts on human rights.</p>
                <p>Congress even started to appropriate money for DRL, making it a “money bureau” in
                    a very small way. There was a small fund, a few million dollars maybe, for human
                    rights projects, which was controlled by the bureau. Congress also earmarked
                    money for specific human rights causes, like the United Nations Fund for Victims
                    of Torture. So, Congress was a very positive force all around on human
                    rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine with the Clinton White House that you felt basic
                        support, that this was an administration that had quite a bit of positive
                        feelings toward human rights, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We did. Occasionally, we would be disappointed. I was talking about
                    China, for example, where we never took quite a tough enough stance, from our
                    point of view. It was during the Clinton administration that China was granted
                    permanent most-favored-nation trade status. On the issue of apprehending war
                    criminals in Bosnia, I think I've already mentioned that the administration
                    sided with the Pentagon in terms of not insisting on a robust effort to make
                    arrests. The administration was also quite negative on the creation of the
                    International Criminal Court (ICC). I had left the bureau before the real
                    negotiations to create an ICC began, but the U.S. did not buy onto the agreement
                    that was hammered out at an international negotiation in Rome. Clinton finally
                    signed the ICC agreement in the waning days of his presidency, but he made no
                    effort to get it ratified by Congress. The Bush administration came in and
                    disavowed his signature. So, while Clinton was favorably disposed toward
                    promoting human rights issues, it was not all positive; other issues often
                    trumped human rights. In fact, there was not that much difference, really,
                    between the first President Bush and Clinton on human rights. Both were strong
                    supporters, as previous presidents had been. It's only under the current Bush
                    administration that things seem really to have changed. And even the current
                    administration has talked big about the importance of democracy and has launched
                    a couple of initiatives on it, which haven't gotten very far, perhaps because
                    its own record on human rights has been so bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>I can't recall if I mentioned in particular Madeleine Albright and her role on
                    human rights. She was still ambassador to the United Nations at the time I
                    started in DRL and was playing a positive role. During the first year or so that
                    I was in DRL, while she was still UN ambassador, she was an extremely strong
                    proponent of human rights and somebody who we could count on in every
                    bureaucratic battle. In fact, we started to make it a practice to include USUN
                    in “split memos,” as if it were a bureau, because we could always count on
                    Madeleine Albright to sign on to our side of whatever the dispute might be. Much
                    to my disappointment, when she became secretary, she tended to take the other
                    side and rule against us. I was rather disappointed in Madeleine. I was so
                    excited when she became secretary because I hoped we would have the secretary
                    agreeing with us on all these things, but it didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any specific things where she didn't
                        agree with you, as secretary of state didn't support you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The China resolution is the best example. She was a solid supporter when
                    she was in New York. But, once she was secretary, she had to take into account
                    trade issues, and security, and a hundred other things that she might not have
                    had to take into account as UN ambassador. We could certainly understand when
                    she ruled against us, but it was a disappointment. We weren't really thinking
                    that U.S. policy would totally change under a new secretary, but we were
                    disappointed at what seemed to be a flip-flop, as if she were no longer taking a
                    position of principle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems? By this time you were a
                        relatively senior officer dealing with junior officers who'd come in pissing
                        vinegar and who may have tended to discount other priorities, like getting
                        rid of missiles in Uzbekistan or the overall problem of trade and gradual
                        development in China and all that. Did you have to have seminars with junior
                        officers to bring them down to reality?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>EICHER: Not so much. We had a lot of junior officers. Most of the desk officers
                    in the human rights bureau tended to be junior, very often in their first
                    assignment in the Department. We had to work with them and do a lot of mentoring
                    and explaining how the Department worked. They usually needed guidance on what
                    they should insist on, what they couldn't insist on, and when they had to buck
                    something up to the next level rather than either cave in or try to settle it
                    themselves. We did instruct them not to start wars with the geographic bureaus,
                    which, I guess, had been a problem from time to time in the past. On the other
                    hand, a few of them were people who really wanted to be on the geographic desks
                    instead of in DRL and some were looking to build good relations with the
                    geographic bureaus with a view to their next assignments. So, in some cases you
                    had to counsel them to be tougher, rather than worrying that they would be too
                    tough. I didn't have a real problem with most of my junior officers. Most of
                    them were responsible, young people who believed in what they were doing and
                    thought they were having a positive influence on policy. I think they were. It
                    didn't take them long to understand the balance of power in the Department. They
                    seemed pleased enough if we would back them up, which we normally did, of
                    course. The general feeling was that as long as you fought the battles well, you
                    didn't have to win them all in order to feel like you were doing something
                    constructive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1998?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: In January of 1998. I retired, actually. I had opened my window, as they
                    call it, at the earliest opportunity when I got to be an FSO-1. My six years ran
                    out at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, did you feel that having concentrated on human
                        rights, we're talking about six or seven years or so, did this detract from
                        your moving ahead in the competitive aspect?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I think there is no question about it. As much as the Department
                    continued to say that human rights were at the core of U.S. foreign policy, and
                    as much as the annual big cables used to tout the critical importance of jobs in
                    the functional bureaus, it just wasn't the case in reality. I remember all the
                    hype that was given during the Clinton administration, especially, that what
                    really mattered increasingly in U.S. foreign policy was the emerging global
                    issuecounter-narcotics and the environment and human rightand these were really
                    the cutting edge of what America was trying to do in the world and what mattered
                    to most of the American people. The functional bureaus were going to be equals;
                    “G” (Global Affairs) was created as a new branch of the Department to ensure
                    that these global issues got the attention and priority they deserved. But all
                    this clearly wasn't true at all in terms of what really went on in the State
                    Department and how the Department really worked. I knew this, of course. I liked
                    the new rhetoric and perhaps I was carried away by it to a certain extent, but I
                    had been around long enough to know where the real power in the Department lay.
                    Still, as I mentioned earlier, when I started working on human rights, first in
                    Geneva and later in the human rights bureau, I felt like I had really found my
                    niche, my calling. I really enjoyed doing it, and I felt I was doing something
                    really worthwhile. With human rights, I felt like I was consistently on the
                    right side of internal policy battles and that I was making a positive
                    contribution both to American policy and to improving things for people in the
                    world. So, I was willing to take the chance and remain in a functional bureau. I
                    probably fooled myself into thinking that I was doing things that would be
                    regarded as important enough by the Department that it would also get me
                    promoted. I was running a large, substantive, political office, fourteen people,
                    the kind of substantive office that was generally run by much more senior
                    officers. I had been political counselor at a large mission. I had been involved
                    in many of the biggest issues of U.S. foreign policy. I always got excellent
                    reports and lots of awards, so it seemed like I was making a good career
                    progression, but I guess it was not to be. It was also one of those times, one
                    of those very bad times in the Foreign Service, when there were very few
                    promotions, so you would get these promotion lists that would have maybe six
                    political officers or something like that out of many hundreds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We go through these things. You know, it's interesting.
                        I've been doing these oral histories now for more than 20 years and I come
                        from the Foreign Service. I came in in 1955 and I've looked at the sweep of
                        things and really, you might say the Department of State and diplomacy in
                        general has changed tremendously in that there are so many international
                        issues such as human rights, arms control, problems with narcotics, and now
                        terrorism and everything else, yet the core of the Foreign Service still
                        holds to the idea that bilateral relations are really the guts of the matter
                        when yes, they're important but one could make a very strong argument that
                        interdependency, internationalization really, this is where diplomacy is
                        going. Did you have a feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I agree that international affairs are going more in the direction
                    you outlined. I think I would have the same analysis as you that, in fact, these
                    big thematic foreign policy issues are becoming more important and people are
                    more focused on them these days. Many of these issues didn't exist at all in
                    previous years. For example, who would have imagined that we'd have a special
                    ambassador for avian influenza or special offices of the State Department on
                    human trafficking or religious freedom? Other issues that were not regarded as
                    front burner in years past are now recognized as extremely important. When I was
                    in the Department, the counter-terrorism office was regarded very much as a
                    backwater by career people, in the same way that human rights was or perhaps
                    even more so. Now, I suspect that is very much a front burner issue.</p>
                <p>The creation of the under secretary for global affairs was intended to make the
                    functional bureaus and their issues much more powerful and much more in tune
                    with the new priorities of policy. The American people it was argued, cared more
                    about environment and human rights and these other cross cutting issues than
                    about bilateral relations with say, Portugal or Tunisia or Sri Lanka. In
                    practice, however, while I was in the Department the undersecretary for global
                    affairs played very much a second fiddle to the other undersecretaries. So that
                    was a disappointment, certainly. It showed that despite the rhetoric and despite
                    a bureaucratic reorganization, the old ways die hard. U.S. foreign policy is
                    still largely driven by the bilateral desks.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>It must have been September or October of 1997 when I was informed that I could
                    stay on for one more year. At that point, I decided I wasn't necessarily going
                    to stay on that long if something else came across my plate and I started
                    looking around a little bit. Just a few days later, one of my friends and
                    colleagues who I had worked with in the human rights bureau and the Middle East
                    bureau, but who was now in European affairs, wandered into my office and asked
                    me if I was interested in a job in Poland with the Organization for Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE's human rights office for all of Europe
                    was based in Warsaw. It was a little office called the Office for Democratic
                    Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). I was aware of this office but I didn't
                    know too much about it or what it did. I heard about it because we dealt with
                    some of the OSCE human rights issues out of my office in the human rights bureau
                    and the ODIHR was involved in some of them. Every year one or two of my people
                    would go to one of the OSCE's human rights conferences, organized by the ODIHR.
                    Anyway, I told him no, I was not particularly interested in going to Poland to
                    work for the OSCE/ODIHR, and I really wanted to look around a bit before taking
                    a position with an organization I wasn't very familiar with. He twisted my arm a
                    little bit and said, “Look, we'll pay for you to go out and spend a couple of
                    days in Warsaw, see the office there, meet the people and then you can come back
                    and decide. No obligation.” So, I thought, well, sure, why not? I can go spend a
                    couple of days in Warsaw. I started asking around about the ODIHR and whether it
                    was a good office and if it was doing things that were worthwhile. Was it the
                    kind of organization that would be a good to get a job with? Was it making a
                    difference? Did it have potential? That sort of question. The ODIHR got kind of
                    mixed reviews. Some people said this was a great opportunity, while others
                    though I could do better. In general, the ODIHR was regarded as a little office
                    with a lot of potential, but apparently it had not done much of note up to that
                    time. On the other hand, the OSCE was growing rapidly and becoming more
                    important since the fall of communism and a lot of people felt the trend could
                    continue. Most people felt that with the right kind of leadership, the ODIHR
                    could be a very good office to be involved with.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>So I flew out, I spent two days with the new director of the ODIHR, a fellow
                    named G�rard Stoudmann, who was a Swiss ambassador, and learned about what the
                    ODIHR was doing, or more importantly, what they hoped to do. Stoudmann had just
                    taken over as director. He knew the office had a fairly weak reputation and his
                    goal was to shake it up and try to make something important out of it. It was an
                    office that had about 25 or 30 people. It was doing election monitoring and
                    organizing conferences, and it had a few very, very small programs to try to
                    promote the rule of law and NGO development, primarily in the former Soviet
                    Union and the new Eastern European democracies. I met with all the different
                    section heads and others in the office, who seemed to be a good group of young
                    people. I was very impressed with Stoudmann and with some of his ideas to move
                    the organization forward and shake it up. He had had pledges of money from a
                    couple of countries and he was very politically-minded as well. He seemed like
                    the kind of person who could get a lot of things moving and who was open to new
                    ideas. Anyway, Stoudmann was apparently also reasonably impressed with me,
                    because at the end of my two days, he offered me the position as his deputy or,
                    officially, as “First Deputy Director” of the ODIHR. As the number two person in
                    the office, I would be in charge of all of the substantive and policy sections
                    of the ODIHR; the other deputy director was a Pole who was in charge of
                    administration and personnel issues. It sounded like it could be an exciting
                    job, with a chance to keep working on human rights and democracy issues and to
                    be exposed to an area of the world that was entirely new to me. It turned out,
                    to my surprise, that the position was at the D-1 level, which, for the OSCE,
                    which uses the UN personnel system, is a very senior level position. There were
                    only half a dozen D level positions in the entire OSCE at the time, maybe less
                    even. So here was a great irony and a morale booster: having just been denied
                    promotion into the Senior Foreign Service, it was only about three weeks later
                    and here I was being offered a senior level job in the OSCE, senior level on the
                    UN scale, and really from a financial point of view much better than if I had
                    been promoted. So between the potential of the job itselwhich looked like it
                    could be very interesting, fun and worthwhiland the benefits that went with it,
                    it really was a very attractive offer.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>By the time I left Warsaw, I was pretty much convinced from my meetings that this
                    would be a good position to take. I still had one other major consideration,
                    however, and that was how my wife would feel about a move to Poland and whether
                    or not she could get a job in Poland. Stephanie had joined the Foreign Service
                    in 1992 while we were in Geneva, as an office management specialist (OMS). She
                    was assigned to Geneva for three years, including about six months when she
                    worked as my OMS, which I think may be against the rules. But we got along very
                    well; she's great to work with, and very efficient. After Geneva, she was
                    assigned to jobs in Washington at the same time I was, in 1995, first in the
                    Office of Assignments and then in the Press Office. She was amenable to a move
                    to Poland if she could also get a job at the embassy. She started asking around
                    with personnel and it happened that there were vacancies at Embassy Warsaw and
                    they were anxious to get somebody out there just as quickly as they possibly
                    could. She was able to break her assignment in Washington. This was in October
                    or November. The ODIHR agreed to hold the position for me until January, after
                    the Christmas break. I actually made one more trip to Warsaw during this period.
                    The OSCE's big annual human rights conference was being held in Warsaw in
                    November and I was assigned to the U.S. delegation, in order to help get me up
                    to speed on some of the issues I'd be dealing with and to meet some of the
                    delegations I'd be working with. So I spent a couple of weeks in Warsaw in
                    November and then returned to Washington to get ready for the move to Warsaw. I
                    retired from the Department on January 15 and started work again on January 19
                    in Warsaw. It wasn't a very long retirement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. This was 1998?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: This was 1998, January 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Warsaw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: We spent four years in Warsaw. Geneva was the only other place aside from
                    Washington where we ever spent four years. Warsaw was not our favorite city, but
                    it was rapidly becoming more Western and it wasn't a bad place; it was very
                    pleasant in the summer. We can talk a little bit about that, if you want.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>My position in Warsaw was a very new experience for me in many ways. I had worked
                    a lot with international organizations but I had never worked actually worked
                    for an international organization before. The ODIHR, as its unfortunate acronym
                    was pronounced (pronounced “oh, dear”), was very international. Most of the
                    local staff was Polish, the head of the office was Swiss, and there was a range
                    of other nationalities, everything from Norwegian to Uzbek. There were two or
                    three other Americans in addition to me. All in all, there were a lot of
                    different working styles, a lot of different approaches to the work, and a lot
                    of cultural baggage, all of which took a little bit of getting used to. But,
                    generally, there was a very positive kind of atmosphere. The staff had a
                    preponderance of young, single people who were just full of energy and
                    enthusiasm and wanted to do good things and change the world in positive ways.
                    There was really a blank sheet in front of us; we had a lot of leeway to decide
                    what we wanted to do and create programs to get it done. The ODIHR was a very
                    young office; it had been created just a few years before, in 1992, I think, as
                    the OSCE “Office for Free Elections.” When I got there the ODIHR was still known
                    primarily for its elections work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I worked for them. I monitored two elections in
                        Bosnia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: That was probably the ODIHR. For the first postwar Bosnian election, in
                    1996, a special structure was set up to monitor the elections; the ODIHR was
                    involved, but I don't think it was in charge. Up to that time, it had tended to
                    do very small election observation missions, just a few people for a few days.
                    Within a very few years, however, it was at the forefront of developing the
                    election observation methodology that has now been adopted by just about every
                    serious observation organization, from the UN to the EU.</p>
                <p>I neglected to mention earlier that I also monitored a couple of elections in the
                    former Yugoslavia during my time in the Human Rights Bureau, one in Bosnia and
                    in one in Croatia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Bosnia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: In Bosnia I was way down south in a little village in the Republic of
                    Srpska. I'd have to think about the name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I worked out of Tuzla.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I was really in the Serb heartland when I was down there on my first
                    mission, in the fall of 1996, and it was quite something. You would have thought
                    it was a perfect election from where we were. Everything was calm and orderly.
                    All the voters were meek and busy voting for their hard-line wartime
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is it. You know, they voted the way you think they
                        would but they did it nicely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: They did it nicely. And the buses of refugees who were supposed to be
                    arriving from the other parts of Bosnia to vote never arrived, for whatever
                    reason. So, everything was calm and fine in the little villages I visited,
                    although it was far from a good election if you looked at the big picture. In
                    fact, the 1996 Bosnian elections were a big bureaucratic controversy within the
                    Department, while I was in the human rights bureau. There was a big dispute over
                    whether the elections should be rushed forward or postponed. DRL's position was
                    that conditions didn't exist for free elections. There was still no freedom of
                    movement; people couldn't go home to vote or couldn't campaign in areas outside
                    their ethnic group. There was still lots of intimidation. But, we were
                    overridden and the U.S. position was that Bosnia should have elections as soon
                    as possible so there would be new, legitimately elected leaders who could be
                    partners in implementing the Dayton peace accords. Well, we know what happened.
                    The elections went ahead and each ethnic group elected the worst of hardliners
                    to represent it, causing all kinds of problems for years.</p>
                <p>I don't remember too much about the Croatian elections I monitored from DRL,
                    except that I was assigned with a few other State Department people to observe
                    in Vukovar, Eastern Slavonia, which was the most war-damaged area in Croatia. It
                    really was a depressing place; much of the city had been destroyed and it was
                    not yet rebuilt. I was with several other State Department observers and there
                    were special arrangements for us, even though we were folded into the broader
                    international observation. I was the only one from the human rights bureau; most
                    of the others were from the desk. When we started to go around on election day,
                    we found that most of the polling stations weren't even open. I thought this was
                    terrible, of course, but my colleagues tended to minimize the problem, saying
                    things like, “oh, it's only an hour or two late; there's still plenty of time
                    for people to vote.” Eventually, however, it was clear even to them that things
                    weren't what they should be. We ended up meeting with some of the senior
                    international personnel in charge and leaning on them to fix the problems and
                    extend the voting hours, which they ultimately did.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>In any case, getting back to the ODIHR, it was originally created in about 1992
                    as the OSCE Office for Free Elections, and after it had existed only a couple of
                    years its mandate was expanded and it became the Office for Democratic
                    Institutions and Human Rightthe ODIHbecause the OSCE political masters decided
                    that there were a lot of additional things the OSCE should be doing to promote
                    democracy, beyond just elections. For its first few years, the ODIHR continued
                    to concentrate on elections, but it also began to hold several big seminars each
                    year on human rights and democracy issues, like freedom of the press or freedom
                    of religion, or whatever the issue of the moment was. It also started to run
                    just a couple of very small projects to promote democracy, for example bringing
                    judges from the new countries of Central Asia to meet with European judges.
                    Stoudmann, who was elected as the ODIHR director less than six months before he
                    hired me as his deputy, thought that the big meetings were not very productive.
                    They were mainly talk shops that were very nice but didn't really accomplish
                    very much. So, he had a plan to shift part of the ODIHR budget from meetings to
                    projects. He had already convinced the Permanent Counciwhich was the OSCE's
                    governing body, made up of the ambassadors of the 55 participating stateto
                    provide the ODIHR with more personnel and more resources.</p>
                <p>One of the other big things which had just happened was that the Danes had given
                    $500,00which was a massive amount of money for the ODIHR at that timto develop a
                    bunch of projects to promote democracy. This was going to be the first time that
                    the ODIHR in its non-election work could actually do something significant other
                    than just hold conferences. It was a chance to do some real hands-on work. This
                    was the situation when I went to Warsaw for my interview. They had the first
                    pledge of money and the general concept of changing and expanding their
                    activities, but they really hadn't put much into place. So, this is one of the
                    things that attracted me to the job. People had been telling me that the ODIHR
                    was a little office that had potential, but I could now see that the potential
                    was genuine. This seemed like someplace where I might make a real difference. It
                    was also a major new challenge in the sense that as the director of DRL/BA, I
                    was sort of the U.S. government's main “finger-pointer” on human rights. A big
                    part of my job and the job of my office was to point out what was wrong with
                    everyone's human rights practices. I saw the ODIHR as an office where I would be
                    much less focused on what country was committing what sort of human rights
                    violations, and more on trying to do something about it. Instead of spending
                    most of my time criticizing countries, or in internal bureaucratic battles, I
                    would need to develop programs and projects that would actually lead to better
                    practices.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>Much of my job at the ODIHR became trying to help develop exactly what these
                    programs would be, and where and how we would do them. At the same time, I
                    became very involved in trying to raise more money from governments to do more
                    programs and develop entirely new areas. And, of course, we also continued and
                    expanded our election work. It just turned into a great job, a wonderful
                    experience, at just the right time and the right place. Communism had fallen and
                    the former communist countries opened their arms to us. They wanted to be seen
                    as “Westerners” or at least as reliable partners. They wanted to be democracies,
                    or, at least, they said they did. They all wanted to be part of Europe. They saw
                    OSCE as one of their tickets to all these things they wanted.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Some of the countries were implementing very radical reforms and looking for help
                    and advice. Even those which didn't seriously want to change wanted to look like
                    they were changing, so they also had open arms for us. The Western members of
                    the OSCE, meanwhile, were looking for respectable organizations which would take
                    on some of the work of helping to build democracy in the former Soviet Union and
                    Eastern Europe. They had their own assistance programs and had been giving money
                    to NGOs, but they were very pleased to help out an international organization,
                    of which they were members, to also do this kind of work. It was almost like
                    knocking on open doors to get contributions from the Western governments for the
                    kinds of programs that we thought we might do. During my four years in Warsaw we
                    grew the office to over 100 people, from 25 or so when I arrived. Our voluntary
                    contributions from governments increased more than tenfold; we were up to about
                    $6 million a year from the $500,000 when I started work in Warsaw. This amount
                    of money is peanuts for governments, of course, which was one of the reasons why
                    we were able to get it. But, for the kind of programs we were doing, it was real
                    money. It was mainly “political money,” if you want to call it that, rather than
                    aid money, that is, very little of it had the kinds of string attached and
                    bureaucratic oversight that governmental foreign assistance offices usually
                    require. From State Department, for example, we were getting money mainly from
                    the European bureau and also from the refugee bureau; and it tended to be
                    contributions with no strings attached. The spirit of the U.S. contributions was
                    “here's a contribution of $50,000 or $80,000; do something good with it,” or
                    “here, you said you wanted to start a program to combat trafficking. We think
                    that's a good idea and here's a contribution.” We kept careful track of the
                    money, of course, but we found that we didn't have all kinds of people looking
                    over our shoulders and we were seldom asked for a detailed accounting. It was
                    the same with most of our other contributors. At first, we drew up a list of
                    little projects that we went looking for contributors for, and that worked
                    pretty well, but over time, as we built our record as an office that was doing
                    impressive things, we moved more towards larger contributions for general
                    program arealike rule of law, or rights of womerather than, say a particular
                    small project on women in Tajikistan. One of the fund-raising tricks I learned
                    was to go to countries as they approached the end of their fiscal year. In the
                    U.S., government, there is always a little money left on the shelf as the fiscal
                    year ends that needs to be spent or returned to the treasury. The same was true
                    for other countries. So, in addition to the annual plan we had drawn up, we
                    would go to various countries as the end of their fiscal year was approaching
                    with some ideas of worthwhile activities they could fund for us. As a result, we
                    tended to get our big United States contributions in August or September as the
                    fiscal year was coming to a close. We would get the Canadians and, I think, the
                    British in March as their fiscal year was coming to a close, and most of the
                    Europeans in December as their fiscal year was ending.</p>
                <p>Now, with this money we started a number of different programs and projects. In
                    some cases a country came to us and said, you know, we would like your help with
                    a prison reform project or a project to train judges, those kinds of things.
                    Most often, however, we would originate ideas and projects out of the office in
                    Warsaw, or as the result of needs assessment trips to various countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>This left me with a lot of leeway to decide what kind of programs to develop. We
                    were really able to get into a lot of different things. One of the first things
                    I noticed about the OSCE once I started working there was how backwards they
                    were on women's rights, which, you'll recall, I had worked a lot on at State.
                    So, one of the first things I did was to start a program to promote the rights
                    and equality of women; I believe this was the first one ever in the OSCE. We
                    were able to get a grant of money from one of the Nordic countries and to get an
                    expert seconded by the UK. With these, we were able to start a program to
                    advance women's rights, including lots of little projects from legal clinics for
                    women in Tajikistan to training women members of parliament in Azerbaijan. This
                    was very well received by OSCE member states, which were very impressed with the
                    kinds of things we were able to do with a very small pot of money. It led to
                    increasing support for the ODIHR as we branched out into other areas. We also
                    did a little internal work on gender equality within the organization, drawing
                    up the first OSCE plawhich was adoptefor requiring a professional working
                    environment, free from discrimination or harassment.</p>
                <p>The OSCE, meanwhile, had tiny offices established in several of the countries of
                    the former Soviet Union and was establishing new ones where they didn't already
                    exist. We were able to use these as sort of our embassies, to have
                    representatives on the ground in these various countries. This worked out very
                    well, because these offices tended to be little four or five person offices that
                    often didn't have clear mandates and sometimes didn't really know what to do
                    with themselves, or have the resources to do things if they did know what they
                    wanted to do. So, in general, they tended to welcome us and cooperated well with
                    us. If we said, hey, you know, “we've got $100,000; how about starting a program
                    to train police officers in human rights or to reform prisons or to develop
                    non-governmental organizations,” they would say “wow, great, yes!” The host
                    government had to agree and it virtually always would since there was no stigma
                    attached to our programs. We negotiated formal agreement“memoranda of
                    understanding” with the five Central Asian “stans” and the tree Caucasus
                    countries. These were frameworks for projects that we would carry out in each
                    country, so they were formally approved by the governments, which made it far
                    easier when it came time to implement something that required government
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>One of the programs we started was on ending human trafficking. Again, we were
                    able to get a seconded persothis time from the United States, as well as a
                    seconded person from Austrito start the program. This was the OSCE's first
                    anti-trafficking program. It grew dramatically and soon became a major theme in
                    the organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>We were also able to start a program to combat torture. We knew this could be a
                    very sensitive subject, so we handled it carefully. We created a little panel of
                    experts and were able to enlist five of the world's leading experts on combating
                    torture, who all happily agreed to act as sort of an advisory board for us. We
                    got the UN Special Rapporteur against torturSir Nigel Rodley; the International
                    Committee of the Red Cross's head of protectioDanielle Caucause; Amnesty
                    International's head of European and Central Asian AffairIan Gorvin; the head of
                    the biggest torture treatment and rehabilitation center in the U.S. Doug
                    Johnson; and a retired head of the Council of Europe's Committee for the
                    Prevention of TorturClaude Nicolay. So it was a very elite, very distinguished,
                    group. This was vitally important in giving credibility to our program and
                    gaining acceptance for it. If this panel looked at our program and said yes,
                    this is a good program and yes, it does not duplicate what is being done
                    elsewhere and yes, it would be a good thing to spend money on, then the donors
                    and the recipient countries were both satisfied. So we protected ourselves from
                    criticism on one of the most sensitive issues we were dealing with, as well as
                    getting help in developing a useful program. We came up with many kinds of
                    little projects within this program, things like trying to change legislation,
                    trying to get countries to report more effectively to the UN as they were
                    required to do under the Convention Against Torture, trying to change practices
                    in prison administration. We got a couple of very good prison experts who would
                    visit countries and offer free advice. It was amazing to see what they could
                    accomplish, just by making a suggestion. For example, they'd ask, “why don't you
                    let prisoners out to exercise twice a day instead of once a day? Or why don't
                    you let the prisoners plant a garden to grow vegetables?” The answer would
                    usually be, “gee, we never thought of that; sure, we could do that.” We actually
                    helped establish a college in Croatia, specifically to train prison guards in
                    good practices.</p>
                <p>We had a rule of law program; we had a special program to develop ombudsmen and
                    national human rights commissions. We also did programs on freedom of movement,
                    such as trying to end the so-called propiska system, the old Soviet system,
                    which was still in practice in much of the region, that prevented people from
                    living or moving where they wanted to. We established a big program on Roma and
                    Sinti, that is, gypsies, who were probably the most persecuted minority
                    throughout Europe. We became one of the best respected organizations in Europe
                    for dealing with Roma and Sinti problems and we started programs trying to
                    improve conditions for them and have their grievances heard. Almost all of these
                    programs were developed while I was there, by people I recruited. It was great
                    fun and very rewarding. You felt as if you were really doing something
                    important, things that actually helped people and strengthened freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time were the Roma pretty well settled? I mean,
                        one of the problems used to be that, gypsies would move back and forth. Was
                        an effort made or had things happened so that they were now more or less in
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>EICHER: Most of them were settled in place, although there are still some
                    “travelers,” as they call them, in Europe. The Roma in most European countries,
                    however, are really at the lowest levels of society. Very often they live in
                    poverty and face a lot of discrimination. The treatment they got in some places
                    was truly outrageous. In many places there is still a very general sense of the
                    Roma being “Gypsies, tramps, and thieves.” They were not welcome. It reached the
                    point that in Slovakia, one town was trying to build walls around the Roma
                    neighborhoods to separate them from the rest of the citizens, literally to put
                    them into a walled ghetto. Discrimination against Roma was a problem all over
                    Europe. The biggest Roma community in Europe was actually in Spain, but the Roma
                    were practically every place. Many people don't know that they were hit very
                    hard by the Holocaust. Hitler tried to eliminate Gypsies as well as Jews and
                    others, and many, many of them went to the death camps. A lot of the big Roma
                    communities had been in Eastern Europe and they, in particular, suffered during
                    the war. I think it was really under communism that the Eastern and Central
                    European Roma were finally forced to settle down and end their nomadic
                    existence. But, generally they were living in very bad conditions. Our Roma
                    program was a small one, as most of our programs were. There was a limited
                    amount we could do. But we could help galvanize the Roma voice and help them
                    develop common positions which could be pressed internationally. We did this,
                    sometimes quite effectively. In fact, the OSCE adopted a number of standards on
                    Roma and we could use these as ammunition whenever there was a serious problem
                    of discrimination, to try to twist a country's arms and make them abide by
                    better practices.</p>
                <p>I should say that the OSCE had wonderful documents on human rights, starting with
                    the Helsinki Accords back in 1976, before the OSCE was even an organization,
                    when it was still the CSCE (the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
                    Europe). As communism began to fall, the CSCE transformed itself into the OSCE
                    and adopted a whole series of accords setting human rights standards that in
                    many ways were much stronger than UN or other standards. However, they were
                    political agreements rather than legal treaties, so they were politically and
                    morally binding on the states, rather than legally binding. The various
                    documents could be used to put pressure on states that weren't doing things they
                    should. We could use them to do a little finger-pointing and to insist that a
                    country was obliged to do something or stop doing something, but there was there
                    was no enforcement mechanism other than opprobrium. Nonetheless, we did act as a
                    pressure point within the OSCE, for example, pushing for the release of
                    political prisoners in various countries and for changes in particular
                    practices. I remember getting half a dozen political prisoners released in
                    Turkmenistan, once. Another example was exit visas, which were still required by
                    most of the former Soviet states. If someone wanted to leave the country, even
                    for a vacation, they would need to get an exit visa. At a minimum, this was a
                    huge hassle for people, and often it was used by a government to prevent critics
                    from traveling. Exit visas were contrary to the freedom of movement principles
                    the OSCE had adopted and we helped persuade a number of states to do away with
                    exit visas.</p>

                    <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your office in the OSCE, the basic concentration was the
                        former Soviet Union, wasn't it? And Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Soviet Bloc essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Yes, very much. Very much so, and especially the countries of the former
                    Soviet Union. At first, we were doing programs in some of the Eastern European
                    countries, former Soviet Bloc countries like Poland, but they were changing so
                    quickly that they soon became our partners. They didn't even call themselves
                    Eastern Europeans, in fact; they were now “Central Europeans” and they were
                    looking West rather than East. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined
                    NATO while I was living in Warsaw; it was a very big event for them; there was a
                    big celebration. They were also moving to join the European Union. So, while we
                    still did a few little programs in some of these countries, we were relying more
                    and more on the Central Europeans to provide us with experts to work on
                    countries further east, in the former Soviet Union, as well as in the Balkans.
                    With the Poles, for example, we set up a nice program to bring border guards
                    from the former Soviet Union countries to Poland to be trained by the Poles. The
                    Central Europeans wouldn't take any guff from the former Sovietthat is, they
                    wouldn't show any sympathy to arguments like “change takes a long time” or “its
                    difficult to break down years of communist tradition,” since they were making
                    the changes quickly and successfully themselves.</p>
                <p>We also occasionally got into projects with other countries, even Western
                    countries, on issues like combating human trafficking or Roma rights, but
                    generally our programs were in the former Soviet Union and the Balkans. We tried
                    to get something going with Turkey, but the Turks didn't want us involved, so we
                    worked a bit around the margins there. We were one of the sponsors of the
                    “Istanbul Protocol,” which is now well known in its field as a compendium of
                    best practices for doctors to determine if a person has been tortured. That was
                    one of our anti-torture projects.</p>
                <p>Getting back to the question of where we focused our work, by the end of my time
                    in Warsaw, we started to run into a little bit of a problem with our election
                    programs because they were so heavily focused on the eastern part of the OSCE.
                    The easterners started to get a little sensitive about this, and rightly so.
                    They said there were problems with elections everywherlook at Florida as just
                    one example; the 2000 Florida election fiasco, if you want to call it that, took
                    place while I was at the ODIHR. So, they asked, why should we focus just on
                    them? This was to some extent a rhetorical question. They didn't really care
                    very much what was happening in Western elections, they just wanted to deflect
                    attention from their own problematic elections and they thought that by
                    emphasizing problems in the West, their own deficiencies wouldn't seem so bad,
                    or at least would be seen in a different context.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>Whatever their motives, it was actually a good point that no election is perfect
                    and all countries should be considering ways to improve their election
                    processes. So, we started to expand our election programs to look at elections
                    in Western countries of the OSCE as well as in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
                    Before I left the ODHIR, we had done the first assessment of a Western election.
                    France invited us to take a look at their election and we sent a very small team
                    for a week or so that assessed the process and prepared a short report. It
                    wasn't a big thing but, nevertheless, it was a good, symbolic gesture that
                    everybody's elections could be looked at. Later, this effort was expanded to
                    include many other Western countries, including the United States. I actually
                    headed ODIHR election missions to several Western countries, including Spain,
                    the UK and Italy, but that was later, after I had left full time work and the
                    ODIHR and started working as a consultant.</p>
                <p>In any event, I've started talking about elections, and so I should step back a
                    little and put the ODIHR's election work into context since up to now, I've been
                    describing the ODIHR's democracy programs and haven't really mentioned
                    elections. I started with the democracy programs since they were interesting and
                    fun because that part of the office barely existed when I got there. That was
                    where we had the real growth and where we could develop all kinds of new, and
                    hopefully valuable programs. I was involved in building that up pretty much from
                    scratch. Still, what the ODIHR was best known for before I got there, while I
                    was there, and since, is its work on elections and, in particular, election
                    observation.</p>
                <p>The ODIHR's election observation program already existed when I arrived in
                    Warsaw. I think I mentioned that the office started out as the OSCE Office for
                    Free Elections. The election observation program had started as a very small and
                    unprofessional kind of operation where they would send two or three people out a
                    couple of days before an election to look at what was going on and write a
                    report. This had already developed into something much bigger and more
                    systematic and was continuing to grow and to become more professional and better
                    respected during my tenure. By the time I arrived at the start of 1998, the
                    ODIHR election section had developed and begun to implement a professional and
                    systematic methodology for effective observation.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>I think few people who read about election observation really understand what a
                    large scale and complex operation it can be. The ODIHR's system was to send a
                    team out to the country to start following the election process on the ground
                    about six weeks before voting day. This would include a “core team” of eight or
                    ten experts on elections, politics, media, and legal affairs, plus 20 or 30
                    “long term observers” who would be stationed around the country to follow
                    election developments in the different regions. Then, a few days before the
                    election, a large numbeoften hundredof “short term observers,” STOs, would
                    arrive in country. We'd train them and brief them, then send them out all around
                    the country to serve as poll watchers and also to watch the vote counting. The
                    STOs would fill out forms for each polling station they visited, answering
                    questions like, “was it too crowded? Was the voting done in secret? Did the
                    polling officials know what they were doing and did they follow the rules? Was
                    there any ballot box stuffing or other blatant fraud going on? Was the
                    atmosphere intimidating?” and so forth. Then, their forms would be send back to
                    the core team where a statistician would enter it all into a computer. Between
                    the STO forms and their descriptive comments, we would get a very good
                    quantitative and qualitative overview of election day on which to base our
                    assessment. Between the core team's long-term observations of the campaign
                    period and the STO observations, we were able to offer a studied and credible
                    assessment of what was right and wrong with the election and even had statistics
                    to back up our conclusions.</p>
                <p>As the years went by, the system was increasingly refined. We produced a
                    methodology on how to review and assess election legislation, which, of course,
                    is a key element of any election process. We also produced guidelines for
                    minority participation in elections. Later, we did a handbook on observing
                    women's participation in electionI actually authored that one, after I moved on
                    from the ODIHR. So, it was a very good, and very effective methodology, which
                    brought us a lot of credit.</p>
                <p>Election observation became a huge operation. A really big mission might involve
                    well over 1,000 people, including core team, STOs and local hires, who were
                    mainly interpreters and drivers. It was very complex administratively, as well
                    as being politically sensitive. We would do about 10 of these operations every
                    year, so it took an enormous amount of work. We were very cost effective since
                    all the STOs were seconded by governments and had to pick up all of their own
                    expenses. We costed it out once and found that we typically were running a
                    good-sized election observation for $200,000 or $250,000 that would have cost
                    ten times as much if we had had to pay for all the STOs. At first I though that
                    we would run into donor fatigue, that U.S. and the Western Europeans would soon
                    be reluctant to foot the bill for so many election observations, year after
                    year. But it turned out that was not a problem. The donor countries were very
                    supportive and didn't balk at all even as the operations got larger and more
                    complex.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>On the political side, election observation was very significant. Very few people
                    in the United States have ever heard of the OSCE, much less the ODIHR. In
                    Eastern Europe and the Balkans, however, the ODIHR was very well known. We would
                    get a lot of publicity. People waited for the statement we'd issue after
                    election day and would pay careful attention to it. We were the biggest and most
                    credible of the election observer organizations, so our judgment was seen as the
                    most authentic assessment of whether an election was free and fair. The
                    governments desperately wanted our seal of approval, since they saw it as
                    recognition that they were joining the ranks of Western democracies. If we
                    issued a negative report, it might effect a country's relations with the West,
                    or it would at least give that country's leader the stigma of having taken
                    office as a result of a less than democratic contest. So the stakes were high
                    and sometimes we would come under a lot of pressure from governments to tone
                    down our criticisms. I think we did very well in maintaining an independent,
                    unbiased approach and issuing honest, often very critical assessments. In a few
                    cases, our statements may have contributed to domestic unrest. Some countries
                    adopted our recommendations and things improved significantly from election to
                    election. In other countries, particularly in Caucasus and Central Asia,
                    progress was much less evident, and in some cases, things even moved backwards
                    from the initial democratic push that followed the fall of communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the former Yugoslavia? What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well, that's interesting. First of all, the former Yugoslavia is where the OSCE
                    really got its start as an organization that did work in the field, as opposed
                    to the old CSCE, which was really centered on conferences and negotiations. When
                    the peace agreements on Yugoslavia were hammered together, the OSCE was given a
                    big role, in part because the UN had gotten a bit of a bad name in Yugoslavia
                    for being ineffective in ending the war or protecting civilians. So, there was
                    this large OSCE mission set up in Bosnia and smaller ones in other former
                    Yugoslav countries. The missions were disproportionately large compared to OSCE
                    headquarters in Vienna. At first there was, maybe, several hundred OSCE staff
                    assigned to the missions in the Balkans, and only a couple dozen people working
                    at headquarters in Vienna. It really seemed like the tail wagging the dog.
                    Anyway, because there were these big OSCE missions in the Balkans that were at
                    the time larger than the ODIHR, we decided that our comparative advantage lay
                    elsewhere and we concentrated our programs on the former Soviet countries rather
                    than the former Yugoslavia. We did monitor elections in the Balkans and we had a
                    few little programs here and there in cooperation with the OSCE missionI
                    mentioned earlier our prison reform program, which worked mainly in Croatia. I
                    also went to Macedonia at one point and set up a program there to train police
                    on human rights; this was a joint effort with the UN High Commissioner for
                    Refugees and the Soros Foundation. But, generally we were not heavily involved
                    in programming in the former Yugoslavia in the way that we were in the former
                    Soviet countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>There were three main exceptions to this. One was human trafficking, where we
                    started quite a large program. The Austrian government seconded a former cabinet
                    minister to us who served as coordinator for a big anti-trafficking initiative
                    focused on the Balkans. It was awkward, at times, because she was based in
                    Vienna, not Warsaw, and she could be a bit of a loose cannon. She reported to me
                    and I spent a lot of time working with her, to make sure her many initiatives
                    made sense in the OSCE context and that we weren't committing ourselves to
                    things we couldn't budget or support adequately. But some good things came out
                    of it, especially in terms of building international awareness, and consensus on
                    the need to fight human trafficking, even in Europe.</p>
                <p>Second, for a couple of years the ODIHR, through a quirk, had a little office in
                    Montenegro that functioned like an OSCE mission would. This was at the time that
                    Montenegro was still part of Serbia and Montenegro. There was a lot of tension
                    between Serbia and Montenegro, and a lot of tension within Montenegro. The OSCE
                    would have liked to have an office there, but the government in Belgrade
                    refused. The ODIHR had monitored an election in Montenegro and we decided to
                    keep our election office open, ostensibly to do election follow-up work. In
                    practice, however, we really ran a political mission which spent most of its
                    time following and reporting on political developments. The new Montenegrin
                    government was happy with this, even if the Serbs weren't. And, since there were
                    no other foreign representatives in Podgorica at the time, our guys were
                    producing very valuable political reporting which was much appreciated by Vienna
                    and others. A number of countries gave us contributions to keep the office open
                    without having to go through the Vienna budget approval process. Our office was
                    headed by a very effective British former army officer, Julian Peel Yates, who
                    was well respected by all sides. His reports would come to me for approval, then
                    I'd send them on to the designated list of recipients. So, our ODIHR office in
                    Warsaw was actually playing a valuable role in keeping international links open
                    to Montenegro at a time when it was very isolated and when it might easily have
                    swung the way of the Serbs.</p>
                <p>Our third major undertaking in the former Yugoslavia was a big Kosovo project.
                    The Kosovo crisis had been brewing since even before Yugoslavia broke up, but it
                    came to a head in 1998, with the outbreak of serious fighting between the Serbs
                    and the Kosovo Liberation Army. In the last half of 1998, there was a
                    UN-sponsored peace agreement, which, among other things provided for the
                    creation of an OSCE “Kosovo Verification Mission” (KVM) to monitor compliance
                    with the ceasefire. The ODIHR helped establish the human rights section of the
                    KVM and we seconded one of our best officers to go down and set it up. One of
                    its main activities was to monitor, investigate and document human rights
                    violations. Since the KVM became a huge undertaking relative to the size of the
                    ODIHR, we pretty much bowed out after the initial stages of setting up the human
                    rights section. But, then things got much worse in Kosovo, the ceasefire fell
                    apart, and the Serbs started a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the
                    Kosovars. The security situation became so bad that the KVM evacuated to Albania
                    and Macedonia and then was disbanded. This was the situation that eventually led
                    to the U.S. bombing campaign against Serbia.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>Back at the ODIHR, we saw a real risk that all the valuable information gathered
                    by the KVM would be lost. There were lots of press reports and anecdotal reports
                    of the horrors that were going on in Kosovo, but the KVM files were a treasure
                    trove of detailed information gathered by a leading international organization.
                    Lots of it had been piled in the back of Landrovers as the KVM was leaving
                    Kosovo and was sitting unorganized in boxes in private apartments in Skopje.
                    There was no system or capacity in the OSCE even to hang on to this stuff. So,
                    since it was human rights material and the KVM was in the process of ceasing to
                    exist, we arranged to have the materials transferred to the ODIHR in Warsaw. The
                    Poles even sent a military plane down to pick it up and provided security for us
                    once it was in Poland. We assembled a team of half a dozen people, many of them
                    former KVM human rights officers, led by the head of the ODIHR's human rights
                    section, to review and compile the material. The result, after months of work,
                    was a huge book that documents the horrendous sequence and scale of human rights
                    violations in Kosovo. It was called Kosovo/Kosova, As Seen, As Told, which came
                    to more than 400 pages of small print, meticulously documented with thousands of
                    footnotes, compiled from eyewitness and refugee accounts and OSCE
                    investigations. It was by far the most comprehensive account of the horrors of
                    Kosovo that eventually led to the NATO bombing of Serbia. It makes for really
                    depressing, horrific reading, but it tells a story that should not be forgotten.
                    We worked in consultation with the War Crimes Tribunal, which was grateful for
                    our contribution. The book is a very important work, which is still relevant.
                    Anyone who doesn't understand why the Kosovars were demanding independence from
                    Serbia could flip though its pages and see exactly why.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the worst of the “stans,” Uzbekistan and
                        Turkmenistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: Well, I visited both of them lots of times. When I began work with the
                    OSCE, all of the Central Asian countries were very much in this mode of “we're
                    moving toward democracy and we want to be accepted as a Western country; we do
                    want to improve human rights and we want your help.” This was the public line,
                    at least, and we did our best to hold them to it. Uzbekistan, in fact, was the
                    very first country that the ODIHR signed a memorandum of understanding with.
                    This was an agreement to start to do some little projects in Uzbekistan. We were
                    able to carry those out without any significant interference from the government
                    even at a time when other NGOs were having great problems trying to do human
                    rights and democracy work in Uzbekistan. After Uzbekistan signed its agreement
                    with the ODIHR, the other Central Asians we very much in a “me too” mode.
                    Uzbekistan had gotten a lot of good publicity from its agreement with us and the
                    others wanted to jump on the bandwagon. The ODIHR was not seen as threatening.
                    The Uzbekistan agreement had just been signed when I joined the ODIHR, but I was
                    heavily involved in the negotiations of the agreements with the other Central
                    Asia countries, and the Caucasus countries. I remember some fairly difficult
                    trips and talks to put together the agreements with Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and
                    Azerbaijan.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>Turkmenistan was the only country where the negotiations finally died. We were
                    unsuccessful there. We tried for a couple of years. We went back and forth with
                    them on the substance of an agreement and we thought we would be able to succeed
                    because all of the other four “stans” had agreed to essentially the same
                    language. Turkmenistan, however, was the most closed and repressive of all the
                    countries, and that was reflected in the positions it took. It insisted, that
                    for example, we take the words “human rights” out of the agreement, which we
                    thought was too high a price. So, we were able to do some tiny, tiny things in
                    Turkmenistan through the OSCE office there, by sending them very small amounts
                    of money to hold a meeting on this, or conference on that, or a training session
                    on something else, but it was very sporadic and very small and not very
                    effective. It was increasingly clear that Turkmenistan was moving in the wrong
                    direction. The president, Niyazov, who styled himself “Turkmenbashi,” or the
                    “Father of the Turkmen,” was building a cult of personality similar to what
                    you'd see in North Korea. He built huge monuments to himself, including one in
                    the center of Ashgabat that looked like a huge spaceship, with a golden statue
                    of himself on top that rotated so he was always facing the sun. He renamed the
                    months of the year after himself and his family. He began to dismantle the
                    country's health and education systems and deliberately to move towards
                    isolation. For me, the last straw came when had himself elected “president for
                    life.” That's completely contrary to all the democratic principles enshrined in
                    OSCE documents. This happened at Christmastime in 1999 or 2000. I was in charge
                    of the ODIHR over the holidays and I tried to get the OSCE to react. I lobbied
                    the Chairman in OfficNorway, at the timand some of the big member states, but no
                    one wanted to take strong action. I even drew up a graduated list of steps the
                    OSCE might take, things like recalling the OSCE ambassador for consultations.
                    There was absolutely no political will to do anything. I finally threatened the
                    Norwegians that if they didn't at least issue a critical statement, then the
                    ODIHR would issue its own, which would make it look like they had missed the
                    boat or were weak-kneed or both. They finally caved and issued a reasonable
                    statement, but no further action against Turkmenistan was taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the development of the European Union was
                        helping or hurting the things you were trying to accomplish in the
                        OSCE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The Europeans, like the Americans, were very strongly in favor of the
                    kinds of things that the OSCE was doing on human rights, very strong supporters,
                    gave a lot of money for it. If there was a problem that we could see for the
                    future, it was that the European Union was expanding so much or looking to
                    expand so much that it could start to raise a question of what would be its
                    relative role to the OSCE. You would very soon get to a point when more than
                    half the OSCE countries were also members of the European Union. The question
                    was, what would that mean for the OSCE?</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>The more difficult division within the OSCE, which has become even more
                    pronounced in recent years, was the split between the Westerners and most of the
                    former Soviet countries. Because of the work we at the ODIHR were doing on human
                    rights, we started to run afoul of a number of the former Soviets. There were
                    still huge problems in Chechnya at the time. We helped set up a little
                    OSCE/Council of Europe office in Chechnya to help monitor what was going on
                    there. The Russians agreed to that but as we found ourselves getting more and
                    more critical of the Russians and the Uzbeks and some of the others, they became
                    more and more critical of us. You could already start to see on the horizon that
                    there could be problems ahead for the OSCE if these types of strains were not
                    very carefully managed.</p>
                <p>While I spent most of my time at the ODIHR working on the different human rights
                    and democracy and election programs and managing the office on a day-to-day
                    basis, the ODIHR director, Ambassador Stoudmann, who didn't really have a deep
                    background in human rights and democracy, spent most of his time trying to keep
                    the political side of it together. He was very politically savvy and was a
                    master of operating within the OSCE. Despite some the problems we were facing,
                    he was able consistently to build sufficient political support to ensure that
                    the office could continue to do its work and even to expand its work continually
                    into new areas. He traveled constantly and was in Warsaw only maybe a third or a
                    quarter of the time. When he came back from a trip, he would often have another
                    little project in one country or another that that we would have to implement to
                    keep some president or foreign minister happy. These sudden, little additions to
                    an already heavy workload used to drive the staff crazy, especially since they
                    were not always self-evidently useful from a substantive perspective. I had to
                    spend a lot of time explaining to young staffers that we were a political
                    office, and that the cost of doing our real substantive work sometimes included
                    building broad support by doing things that might not be as useful, but were
                    nevertheless not harmful. So, we might have to put on a little seminar in Moscow
                    or send an expert on something to Tashkent, which wasn't on the original work
                    plan and might not accomplish much, but it was well worth it to build the
                    goodwill and cooperation we needed. I should say to Stoudmann's credit, as well,
                    that he was very supportive of most of the things I was doing. I think he was
                    initially skeptical of some of the human rights things that I initiated but he
                    came to trust me and to give me pretty much a free hand to start new programs
                    and to move things forward.</p>

                <p>The OSCE operates by consensus. Decisions are taken by the Permanent Council in
                    Vienna, or by the annual meetings of foreign ministers. Getting consensus among
                    55 countries can be hard, of course and it can be a formula for paralysis, since
                    you can't do anything unless everybody agrees. The OSCE, as an organization, was
                    often tied up in knots by the objections of just a handful of countries, or even
                    just a couple. At the ODIHR, however, we found a way to sidestep this problem.
                    We decided that since the member countrieor “participating states,” as they were
                    callehad adopted all these wonderful human rights agreements and since the
                    ODIHR's mandate was to promote democracy and human rights, we would pursue
                    whatever activities or programs we thought best and if anyone objected then it
                    was up to them to get a consensus to tell us to stop. This was pretty gutsy, of
                    course, and I think Stoudmann deserves a lot of credit for his willingness to
                    lead us in that direction. If we had agreed to submit our program to the
                    Permanent Council for them to approve every project, it would have been
                    politically safer, but it would have made it impossible to get a lot of things
                    done. The ODIHR had a number of good protectors in the organization, including
                    the U.S., Canada and the Western and Central Europeans, and this put us in a
                    very strong position in terms of there being no chance for a consensus against
                    what we were doing. Also, since most of our projects were funded through
                    voluntary contributions, there was never even a serious threat to our budget
                    while I was there. Still, as I think I've explained, we didn't do things that
                    were deliberately confrontational or a slap in the face to different countries.
                    We were critical, in many cases, but we tried to do it constructively since,
                    after all, we were the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
                    rather than confrontation in Europe. So, we did to always try to work in a
                    positive way but because of the approach that we adopted we were able to do many
                    things that the Permanent Council might never have approved if we had sought
                    approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>I mentioned that Stoudmann was initially skeptical of some of the programs I
                    wanted to start, and I think this deserves a few words of explanation. For
                    example, when I started the first ODIHR program on women's rights, his attitude
                    was sort of typical of what you were getting from most old-time European
                    diplomats at the time, kind of rolling his eyes and thinking that this was just
                    a not-very-useful effort to be “politically correct,” that it was kind of a
                    waste of time and effort but, you know, “go ahead, Peter, if it pleases you.”
                    Then, as the program was launched, he started getting compliments from many of
                    the member countries about how nice it was to see the OSCE working on women's
                    rights and how much they liked our program. He was extremely politically astute
                    and picked the signals instantly that the ODIHR was doing something new that was
                    earning it political credit, and he quickly became a supporter of the program.
                    I'm not sure he was ever a true believer, but after that he said and did all the
                    right things to help us build and expand the program. The next time I wanted to
                    start up a program, on torture or on combating human trafficking and so forth,
                    he might still be skeptical at first but he'd say “okay, you can try that.” As
                    he saw that each program was carefully managed and well regarded by the members,
                    I was able to build his confidence in the programs, and in me. He was able to
                    reap credit politically for all we were doing. I think we made a good team and
                    that we really did push things forward. During my four years at the ODIHR the
                    office tripled in size, to about 100 people from over 30 different countries,
                    and the voluntary contributions we were getting from member countries increased
                    tenfold. It was very rewarding to build an organization like that, that was
                    doing good things and making a difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Then you left the ODIHR in 2002?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: The beginning of 2002. The OSCE at that point had a rule that you could
                    only be in a senior position for four years. The idea was to avoid establishing
                    a large, permanent bureaucracy like the UN. The OSCE's strengths were supposed
                    to be that it was adaptable and quick-moving, which it was, at least in
                    comparison with other international organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It made good sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: I think it made good sense, yes. You lost a lot of institutional memory
                    and that could be a problem. But you also gained by ensuring that you didn't
                    fall into bureaucratic ruts and that there was always new people and new
                    thinking coming in. Not long after I left, however, they started extending the
                    lengths of time that people can remain in the organization and the bureaucracy
                    has really grown. When I speak to people who are now in the ODIHR, I find they
                    have many more constraints than we did. I don't think we could have accomplished
                    all we did under today's restraints.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>One of the more interesting things I did in the four years I was with the ODIHR
                    was traveling with the OSCE chairman-in-office. Each year, one of the foreign
                    ministers of Europe would serve as chairman of the OSCE and each year, as part
                    of their duties, it became sort of a tradition for the Chairman to travel to all
                    of the countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus to wave the OSCE flag and to
                    try to make progress on whatever the issues of the moment were. I traveled on
                    most of these trips. The foreign minister of Polanat the time it was Bronislaw
                    Geremewas chairman one year and I went with him on several trips. Then I did the
                    same with the foreign minister of Austria, Benita Ferrero-Waldner and the
                    foreign minister of Romania, Mircea Geoana. After having served in the State
                    Department, it was an interesting study in contrasts to see first hand how other
                    foreign ministries and foreign ministers work. For one thing, the scale is far
                    smaller. Even in a multilateral delegation, there were far, far fewer people on
                    any of these delegations than on a secretary of state trip. We had at the most a
                    dozen substantive people on each delegation, including the foreign minister and
                    his or her aides, representatives from a couple of other countries, and a few of
                    us from the OSCE permanent staff. I occasionally ended up as note-taker and
                    reporting officer for the meetings, a familiar role from my State Department
                    days. It was also fun because we'd meet in each country with the president, or
                    at least the foreign minister, so I got a lot of very interesting exposure to
                    President Shevardnadze in Georgia, and Akayev in Kyrgyzstan, and Kocharian in
                    Armenia and many others. It was a very interesting time to meet some of these
                    former Soviet strongmen who were still in power in the various countries. The
                    close proximity to the OSCE chairmen on these trips also enabled me to do some
                    good, now and then, since I could whisper in their ear about issues they should
                    raise and most of them were quite responsive. The Polish foreign minister,
                    Geremek, in particular, had been a political prisoner under the communists and
                    was a strong advocate of human rights. As we were about to land in Turkmenistan,
                    I handed him a list of half a dozen political prisoners and suggested he should
                    ask for their release. He did raise it, and several were released shortly
                    thereafter. The Romanian also raised a lot of human rights issues in Central
                    Asia. Interestingly, the Austrian foreign ministry were much less organized than
                    either the two Eastern European countries on the trips; their lack of
                    organization even got a bit embarrassing at timethings like not making clear who
                    was supposed to be at what meeting or what dinner, so more people would show up
                    than there were places for.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Speaking of high-level meetings, each year the OSCE would have an annual
                    conference of foreign ministers where we would have lots of close contact with
                    foreign ministers of various countries and there was one OSCE summit while I was
                    there, the 1999 Istanbul Summit. I think the heads of government of virtually
                    all 55 OSCE states were there, which was really fascinating. We had Bill Clinton
                    there and Boris Yeltsin and everybody else who was a head of government at that
                    time, gathered in this wonderful palace in Turkey on the shores of the Bosporus.
                    From a personal perspective, it was quite a contrast from my State Department
                    experience. I had a number of Foreign Service friends who were also there in
                    Istanbul with the U.S. delegation and they weren't even allowed into the
                    conference hall, which was limited to four persons from each country. But the
                    ODIHR had two seats at the main table, so I was at ringside. There was a
                    wonderful moment where Boris Yeltsin was complaining about the OSCE criticizing
                    human rights problems in Chechnya and Clinton intervened, waving his finger
                    across the room at Yeltsin and telling him, “Mr. President, I remember when you
                    were standing on a tank defending democracy and freedom in Russia and how much
                    we admired you for that and how can you not support the same kind of thing now?”
                    However, it was done in a friendly kind of way since, after all, this was
                    supposed to be a group of friends and it was a closed meeting in a fairly small
                    conference room.</p>
                <p>Let me mention one other funny story from the conference. The summit was held at
                    a time when President Lukashenko of Belarus was starting to be one of the great
                    b�tes noire of the United States. Clinton had been very carefully briefed to
                    give the cold shoulder to this last remaining Soviet-style dictator in Western
                    Europe. When Clinton walked into the Summit meeting hall on the first day, all
                    the heads of state were being seated around the table; most of them were already
                    there. Clinton started going around the big table doing his usual political glad
                    handing and giving everybody a pat on the back or a high five in his best
                    possible political style. Of course, the American president was the star among
                    all the heads of state; everybody wanted to meet him and shake his hand,
                    especially since the media was still in the room taking pictures. As he got to
                    the Belarus seat, Lukashenko got up and they looked at each other and then gave
                    each other a big bear hug. I'm sure Clinton had no idea who he was hugging,
                    thinking it was just another one of these Eastern European leaders he had to be
                    nice and friendly to. The American delegation was absolutely mortified. I never
                    saw the Minsk newspapers the next day, but I'd be surprised if they didn't carry
                    a photo of the bear hug.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Peter, this is a good place to stop. And I want to
                        thank you very much. Just recently what have you done since?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>EICHER: After I left ODIHR I thought I would look for other work but what
                    happened was that after I had been gone about a month or so, I got a call from
                    them saying how would you like to come back and head one of our election
                    observation missions? And I said, “Well, you know, I supervised these from
                    Warsaw for a long time. I've been on a lot of them and they're great fun and
                    they are important but I'm not sure that I would really like to actually spend
                    six weeks in the field heading one.” And they said, “Well, you know, if you
                    would give it a try, the one we had in mind was the Czech Republic and you would
                    have to go to Prague in the springtime and spend six weeks there.” So I thought
                    for a moment and said, “Well, okay. I'll give it a try.” So I went off and
                    headed the election mission to the Czech Republic and ended up liking it so much
                    that it became sort of a career. Over the next four or five years, I headed a
                    dozen different election observations for the OSCE in Armenia, Azerbaijan,
                    Spain, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Bosnia, Turkey and other countries. It was just a
                    truly fascinating experience. Each time you are sort of dropped into a new place
                    and you are right in the middle of the biggest political event going on in the
                    country. You meet all the big leaders, follow all of the exciting political
                    campaign developments and issue your judgment on the extent to which the
                    election met international standards, often with a lot of press play. So I
                    slowly became an election specialist as a result of that.</p>
                <p>Elections are really a human rights issue, in essence. And I've found that they
                    are one of the most challenging human rights issues, because they center on who
                    will be in power. So, while I found in my earlier experiences that even
                    dictators or repressive regimes can be open to cooperation on some human rights
                    issues, many of them draw the line at anything that could interfere with their
                    hold on power, like a free election. So, interestingly, some of the states that
                    are supposedly doing well in other aspects of democratization and human rights
                    continue to have bad elections. Each election mission is a long story in itself.
                    I could go on for hours about them, but I guess that's beyond the scope of this
                    exercise.</p>
                <p>When I wasn't away on election missions, I continued to work for the ODIHR on
                    contracts to write or edit handbooks or reports on human rights. I've found that
                    interesting, since it draws on all I've learned over the past decade. I've
                    written handbooks on individual human rights complaints, on election monitoring,
                    and on women and elections, and I've contributed to many more, on combating
                    trafficking or human rights and terrorism, or other subjects.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>After a few years I started to branch out from the ODIHR. I had an offer from the
                    UN to come work in their election office for a year, which I did. I was team
                    leader for the Iraq elections and referendum of late 2005. That led to some more
                    UN work, including heading a team to Bangladesh. In fact, I've done about five
                    UN missions to Bangladesh now for elections; that's a story in itself. I've also
                    done UN election missions to Turkmenistan and Maldives. I've worked on contract
                    also for half a dozen other organizations. I went and trained election judges in
                    Bahrain for the American Bar Association. I did a little project for the
                    Australian Election Commission. When I was in Russia, I worked on a project for
                    the Norwegian Refugee Council on internally displaced persons in the northern
                    Caucasus. I've helped a couple of other NGOs with their projects. I've also been
                    on several election missions for the National Democratic Institute for
                    International Affairs, to Georgia and Kazakhstan, and twice to Ukraine. All of
                    these would be interesting stories, in their own way. So, I've kept busy, and
                    I've found that there is interesting life outside the Foreign Service, which, I
                    guess, can be a revelation to those of us who spent our careers in the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Time seems to be running out. What was your impression of
                        the Iraq elections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EICHER: It was a very mixed impression. If I had been an election observer, as I
                    have spent so much of the past years doing, I would have been very critical.
                    After all, you couldn't possibly have a fair and free election in the kind of
                    circumstances you had in Iraq. In other countries, we're critical if there are
                    any violent incidents; if a candidate is killed, it's a major black mark against
                    the election. In Iraq, candidates and party activists were getting killed all
                    over the place. All kinds of people who might have wanted to be candidates or
                    activists were locked up without charges. A major party had been banned. There
                    was violence everywhere. There were no election observers because it wasn't safe
                    enough. There was no security for free speech or free campaigning or free
                    movement or all the things you need in a good election. So certainly it was not
                    the kind of election process that met international standards.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, you had to give the Iraqis a lot of credit for being able to
                    do as much as they did under the circumstances. Even to be able to set up an
                    administrative structure that enabled people to go out and cast a ballot was
                    quite a remarkable achievement. Iraqi citizens showed a lot of bravery and
                    determination in going out to vote. You could make a good argument that even
                    severely flawed elections were better than no elections, since the alternatives
                    were either continued administration by the foreign occupation forces or the
                    appointmenrather than electioof Iraqi leaders. And, for all the faults of these
                    elections, you might say that they were better than previous Iraqi elections,
                    where Saddam Hussein regularly got 99 percent of the vote.</p>

                <p>So, all in all, under the circumstances, the process was not entirely
                    unreasonable. It was an election that fell way short of international standards.
                    As for the referendum on the constitution, I'm not entirely convinced that the
                    final outcome was as it was announced, that is, there may have been enough
                    fiddling around with results that the constitution which was adopted may
                    actually not have been legitimately passed by the voters. We just didn't have
                    enough evidence to say that the results were wrong. There were no observers out
                    in the field to give an independent view. The election couldn't have happened
                    without UN assistance, but on the ground, at the polling stations and counting
                    centers, it was run by Iraqis and there were not even UN personnel there to
                    check on how the process was conducted.</p>
                <p>All in all, I think the Iraqi elections were a positive thing. I agreed to work
                    on them even though I was strongly opposed to the invasion of Iraq and the U.S.
                    position on Iraq. The fact was that there was a mess in Iraq that had every
                    prospect of getting even worse. Under the circumstances, I believed that
                    elections were better than no elections and that if there were going to be
                    elections they should be a good as possible. At best, there might be a chance to
                    nudge Iraq towards democracy or something like it. Overall, it seemed to me that
                    elections would be more likely to make the situation better than worse; that
                    they might help move the country towards peace and reconciliation, as well as
                    help get the U.S. out. So, I saw the elections I was working on as an honest
                    effort to try to make the best of a bad situation. I think it did help, at least
                    to some extent. One thing I've certainly learneI guess I knew it even before
                    getting involved in Iraq, but Iraq reinforced it for mis that elections don't
                    make a democracy. Elections are only one step and there are a lot of other
                    things that need to be done before elections can have the kind of effect you
                    want them to.</p>
