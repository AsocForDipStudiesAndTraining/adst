                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 29, 1993. This is an interview with
                        retired Foreign Service Officer Gilbert D. Kulick, which is being done on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. I wonder if you could give me a bit about your background—where and
                        when you were born, a little about your family and your growing up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, the reason that I knew today's date so readily is that it's three
                    days after my birthday. I was born on January 26, 1942—the first month of the
                    World War II era. I was born in Stamford, CT, and moved to Savannah, GA, at the
                    age of four and a half. I did all my primary and high school education in
                    Savannah, up to my senior year, when my family moved to San Antonio, TX.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family doing that caused this movement from
                        Stamford to Savannah to San Antonio?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: My father was in Jewish communal service. He was the director of the
                    Jewish Community Center in Savannah, a social service agency there. Then, during
                    my senior year in high school, he took a better position in San Antonio.
                    However, the circumstances of our moving to and living in the South were such
                    that I never really considered myself a Southerner, despite the fact that I grew
                    up entirely in the South. My parents always went to great lengths to try to
                    counteract influences that I was exposed to in public schools. They always made
                    a great point of sitting me down when I would come home [from school] and tell
                    them about some racist comments that someone in my school might have made. They
                    would point out to me that, “We don't believe these sorts of things.” Curiously,
                    this may have had something to do with the reason that I entered the Foreign
                    Service because people in the Foreign Service tend to be a rather rootless
                    bunch. I never really felt “rooted” where I grew up.</p>
                <p>We moved to Texas. I went to the university there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which university was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The University of Texas in Austin. I moved again to California, to UCLA
                    [University of California in Los Angeles]. So I had a series of educational
                    experiences—it wasn't like being an Army “brat.” I wasn't moving every two
                    years, but, nevertheless, I had this more universalist approach...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We belonged to the same era. I moved around. There was
                        also World War II, which knocked an awful lot of people out of a normal
                        life, at least that generation. What did you study at these
                        universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I did an “honors,” liberal arts program. Here, again, it was a very
                    generalized and unfocussed kind of approach to education. This was a program
                    called “Plan II,” which was an honors, liberal arts course at the University of
                    Texas which enabled and even encouraged students not to specialize in a
                    particular major program of studies. But to get a fairly broad and fairly deep,
                    liberal education. I guess my studies concentrated on government and history but
                    I really had no “major” as such. I just majored in liberal arts.</p>
                <p>My junior year was spent at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. There I developed a
                    very strong interest in Africa, because, curiously enough, there were several
                    African students in the dormitory where I was living. They were medical students
                    who were there under a WHO [World Health Organization] program at Hebrew
                    University. In all, there were about 20 or 25 African students studying
                    medicine. We became very friendly. I had always been interested in Africa from
                    sort of a “naturalist” point of view. I was a great amateur of wild life. I
                    think that, to most young Americans, that's the image we had. You know, Tarzan,
                    the jungle, lions, gorillas, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, there were some travel films which came out—maybe
                        that was a little earlier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, by Osa Johnson. Those films came out in the 1930's, but I knew about
                    them. She and her husband were intrepid explorers. We saw these pictures of
                    them, standing on elephants—back when that was considered a “cool” thing to
                    do.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Anyhow, I became friendly with a lot of these African students. At the end of my
                    year of study [at Hebrew University] I planned a grand trip around Africa. A
                    friend of mine and I were going to go down the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea on
                    a fishing boat to Mombasa. Then we were going to get off and travel down to the
                    Cape of Good Hope and go up the West Coast of Africa. I sat down and figured out
                    that it would take a year to do it, when I really timed it out. I only had about
                    six weeks available. So we scrapped the whole idea and went to Europe instead.
                    But that's where my interest in Africa really began.</p>
                <p>When I finished at the University of Texas, I decided to pursue an African
                    studies program at UCLA. They didn't yet have a degree in this discipline, as
                    such, but I enrolled in a Ph. D. program in political science, on the
                    understanding that they would establish a degree program in African Studies.
                    Indeed, they did, during my first year there. I hold the first M. A. degree in
                    African Studies at UCLA—one of the great distinctions of my early career
                    there.</p>
                <p>At that point the Foreign Service began to look like a logical progression,
                    although it was 1965 and it was not very fashionable...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vietnam War was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: For university students to be thinking about going to work for the
                    government. I had a lot of reservations about it. I spent a year working for the
                    U. S. National Students Association [NSA], while I kind of searched my soul to
                    see whether I really wanted to “sell out” to Uncle Sam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For one thing, when you came into the Foreign Service—I'm
                        not sure if it was right then, but it was about then—part of the contract
                        was that if you entered, you might be sent to Vietnam. Or did that come a
                        little later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was a little bit later. It wasn't that kind of stipulation that
                    inhibited me from taking up my appointment. It was just really a more general
                    sense that I wasn't sure that I wanted to be identified with a government that
                    was pursuing such a heinous policy in Southeast Asia, although the serious
                    opposition to the war was just beginning. It wasn't really until 1966 that the
                    opposition “took off.” The irony, of course, was that it came out later that I
                    was in some ways working for the CIA when I was at the NSA, because the Agency
                    was underwriting a large part of the budget of the international operations of
                    the NSA. I didn't know that at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that, to put it in perspective, it was a matter of
                        conflicting groups of students...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I had no problem with it when it all came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was embarrassing...[Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It started out much more benignly as a genuine recognition on the part of
                    the U. S. Government that we needed to have a liberal student organization that
                    could compete with the communist international student organizations, at a time
                    when public support for liberal causes was...This was at the time of Senator
                    McCarthy in 1948 or 1949. So the CIA clandestinely subsidized the organization
                    [NSA], with no particular strings attached. There was a common, mutual interest
                    in having that kind of group. As time went on, I think, the CIA became “greedy”
                    and saw this not only as an independent force that could promote a broad, U. S.
                    foreign policy goal but as a potential source of agents and intelligence. The
                    reason that NSA decided to cut the tie [with the CIA] was that by that time they
                    were feeling very much “dominated” by the Agency. But the whole thing went sour.
                    Somebody blew the whistle, and the whole organization collapsed.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I spent a year as the NSA African students' “person.” During my year at
                    NSA my wife had a baby. We were living on $4,000 a year. I figured that the
                    State Department FSO-8 entrance salary of $8,000 a year was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little bit about when you were at the
                        university and at the NSA? What did the group around you feel about Africa?
                        This is all very general, but this was the period when decolonization was
                        well under way in most places, though there were some places where it hadn't
                        started.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Remember that I was in an African Studies program, so my friends were not
                    an average cross-section of American students. They were Africans, with a very
                    intense interest in Africa. The feeling was a very buoyant one. This was
                    1963—three years after the great wave of independence in West Africa. Kenya was
                    soon to get independence and Tanzania had just become independent. The view was
                    a very optimistic one. Africa was kind of the “wave of the future.” The African
                    countries were going to avoid all of the mistakes that, say, Latin America had
                    made—all of the corruption and the military dictatorships. After all, they were
                    coming to power in the 1960's, during the era of the great “enlightenment.” The
                    colonial powers had gone to great lengths to try to prepare them for democracy,
                    establishing parliaments and all that sort of thing. Of course, it also
                    coincided with the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. I
                    think that, for most of us, this was looked upon as kind of an extension of our
                    commitment to the Civil Rights Movement in the U. S.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>There was no such thing as a conservative Africanist. I never met one. I heard
                    about a guy named Smith Hempstone, who wrote books with sort of a conservative
                    view of Africa. But interest in Africa was virtually synonymous with liberal
                    politics on the [U. S.] domestic side. It was a very optimistic, idealistic view
                    of Africa. Since then the pendulum has swung much further back toward a more
                    cynical, pessimistic view on the part of a lot of people. But in those
                    days...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even in the State Department, too, there was the view that
                        Africa was the area where opportunity was to be found. This was even
                        earlier. There was the view that one should “get in on the ground floor” in
                        this interesting area and that you would be doing something, rather than
                        holding hands with Swiss bankers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's right. We felt that we were really going to be making a
                    contribution toward the building of a democratic society and nation
                    building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came into the Foreign Service in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: August, 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you first do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The first thing I did was join the A-100 course. The A-100 course was the
                    basic training course for officers newly inducted into the Foreign Service. Most
                    of the members of my class were around my age. In fact, I was, to the month, the
                    average age of that class. We spent, I guess, about three months learning all
                    the basic, diplomatic skills, or at least being exposed to them. I can hardly
                    say that we “learned” them. There were courses in consular work, at which we
                    were all expected to put in a couple of years. We had basic U. S. diplomatic
                    history, a “soupcon” of economics, but very little, really. It's funny, but it's
                    hard for me to reconstruct how we spent those 12 or 14 weeks, but they were very
                    intense. We had a fair amount of “hands on” meetings with people in the
                    Department in the various geographic and functional bureaus, getting a sense of
                    what the real work of the Foreign Service was, as opposed to more theoretical
                    kinds of classroom instruction. On the last day of the course there was a
                    dramatic ceremony where we all assembled in our room and were told our fates for
                    the next two years—very different from today, where you spend a lot of time
                    “negotiating” your assignments.</p>
                <p>I don't know. Are junior, first tour officers still able to negotiate
                    assignments?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I really don't know. I tend to assume “not much.” I
                        imagine that they can ask for a given assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, we were asked, and I knew that I wanted to go to Africa. I had
                    looked and found out where the vacancies for junior officers were. I stated my
                    preferences accordingly. Mogadishu was not on the list—not on my list, anyway,
                    but that's where I was assigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reaction to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: My reaction was, “Oh, God, how am I going to tell my wife?” I thought
                    that she was going to fall into a pit of depression. I had been “bidding” on
                    what was then Leopoldville [now Kinshasa, Zaire]. That was the place where I
                    really wanted to go, because, to me, that was the essence of Africa. I think
                    that my second choice was Dakar [Senegal]. We were very young. I was 24, and she
                    was 20. At that point we had a five-month old baby. She had been a fairly good
                    sport about the idea of going to Africa, but when I said, “Mogadishu,” she said,
                    “What's that? I never heard of it.” I went and got the post reports and, like
                    all post reports, it was highly inflated in some respects. You know the art of
                    writing post reports. [Sound of police sirens getting louder.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's suspend this for a bit. [A short break ensued.] For
                        the transcriber, the police decided that we weren't guilty. You were talking
                        about the art of the post report. Could you explain the rationale between
                        writing some of these post reports which sometimes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Perhaps I should explain what a “post report” is. Every Foreign Service
                    post has a document called the “post report.” It is intended to acquaint
                    newly-assigned people with living conditions in that post. It has segments on
                    local history, politics, and culture, but the real essence is a description of
                    living conditions at the post—housing, local transportation, shopping (a very
                    important element), recreation, and schooling, as education is very important.
                    To some extent, the “post report” has an influence on whether the post qualifies
                    for a “hardship” allowance, although the people who make those determinations
                    don't really work on the post report. They go out and supposedly look at the
                    place quite closely from time to time. But mostly the decision on a hardship
                    allowance is based on the post's description of itself. That's why, sometimes,
                    you get these very exaggerated...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't want to make it sound too nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>KULICK: But on the other hand if you make it sound too terrible, nobody will go
                    there. [Laughter] So, anyhow, we looked at the pretty pictures of the beach
                    club, the local street life, and so forth. She managed to overcome her fear long
                    enough to get our household goods—our very, very sparse household goods at that
                    time—packed up and put on the plane. We had been married about a year.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Mogadishu about a week before Christmas, 1966. I'll never forget
                    getting off the plane, wearing our winter coats which we had worn on the trip
                    over. We were hit by this blast of humid, 95 degree, Indian Ocean weather. It
                    was quite a shock, although there was no reason to have been shocked. We
                    certainly knew that we weren't going to a temperate climate. But that first
                    blast of heat which you get when you get off the plane is very different from
                    all of the descriptions. It is much more vivid and real than all the
                    descriptions. Mogadishu Airport at that point was kind of a decrepit collection
                    of old Italian Army barracks. Any illusions that might have been built up by
                    looking at the pretty pictures in the post report were very quickly dispelled. I
                    don't know how detailed you want to make this, but it was, in fact, a very
                    quiet, sleepy, out of the way place—not on the main route to anywhere, either
                    politically or logistically. For me, at least, it proved to be a tremendously
                    interesting experience.</p>
                <p>Like all Junior Officer Trainees (JOT's, we were called), my assignment was
                    broken up into three or four month segments in the various sections of the
                    Embassy, or the Mission, actually. I spent my first three or four months working
                    for AID [Agency for International Development]. The idea was to expose you to
                    all aspects of Foreign Service work since, at that stage in the ever changing
                    philosophy of training for junior officers, we were not slotted into any
                    particular, professional “stream.” That was not to come until after the end of
                    the first or second tour of duty. But, of course, I knew that I wanted to be a
                    political officer and I took all of this other stuff as kind of recreational or
                    enriching activities. But this didn't change my view as to what I wanted to
                    do.</p>
                <p>Somalia was a unique country in Africa, in many ways. Unlike any other country in
                    Africa it had pretty much of a homogeneous population, at least from the
                    linguistic and religious point of view. It was also fairly homogeneous from an
                    ethnic point of view, although there were some differences between the so-called
                    Hamitic, nomadic peoples of the North and the more settled, agricultural people
                    of the South who were of more conventional, African stock. There was a lot of
                    prejudice by the Hamitic northerners against the so-called “Bantu” people [of
                    the South]. They really weren't really “Bantus.” That's a linguistic term. They
                    were “black Africans.” But they were all Somalis. They all spoke Somali. There
                    was no real, essential cultural difference between them. They had a rough and
                    ready kind of democracy. They had a parliament, real elections, and real debate.
                    Indeed, there was actually a political change in the government while I was
                    there—not a change of party. One prime minister left and another one was voted
                    in. The next time that there was a peaceful change of government in Africa was
                    in Zambia in 1991.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The Somalis prided themselves—and we in the Embassy reflected that—on the
                    perception that Somalia was a real democracy and that it was going to avoid all
                    of the tribalism, corruption, and other blemishes on democracy that were already
                    apparent in the modern history of other countries of Africa. These shortcomings
                    were beginning to show up. The Nigerian civil war was about to begin—indeed, had
                    already taken place at that point. Zaire—then the Congo—was already falling
                    apart and is again falling apart. But Somalia seemed to have the necessary
                    elements to make it. This is now 1993. As we have seen, this was an
                    illusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We now have U. S. troops, along with those from other
                        members of the United Nations, trying to keep Somalia together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Perhaps better said, “trying to put Somalia back together,” as the
                    country has almost totally disintegrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were saying, there is this view within the Foreign
                        Service that, when you are assigned to a country, you like to think that it
                        is kind of a “winner.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Somalia seemed to be a “winner.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, it certainly seemed so at the time. I must say, in very
                    idiosyncratic terms. It was not a place that anybody held up as a paragon of the
                    way Africa should be, simply because it was different. They spoke Italian there.
                    Where else in Africa except for Eritrea did people speak Italian? So it didn't
                    fit into the conventional mode that we have of being a part of British or French
                    or Portuguese colonial history. The Somalis were still a little bit ambivalent
                    about whether they were Africans. To an American they looked like Africans, like
                    other Africans. But those who know the region can very readily recognize a
                    Somali Arab, even from a highland Ethiopian, much less by comparison with
                    so-called “Negro” Africans from the southern and western part of the continent.
                    They were all Muslims—not terribly devout, on the whole. But they had kind of a
                    schizophrenic picture of themselves, betwixt and between the Arab world and
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I found them thoroughly engaging people. They were very irreverent and very
                    democratic, in the sense that they did not have much regard for hierarchical
                    rank or for pretensions among politicians. There were no real social classes.
                    That was characteristic of a nomadic society. Everyone in Somalia has a nickname
                    because two-thirds of the people in the country are named either Mohammed or Ali
                    or Achmad. So they have to have some other way of distinguishing among
                    themselves. They tended to single out physical characteristics or personality
                    characteristics, usually very negative ones. You might have a politician whose
                    name was “Zuppo,” for example, which I think means “lame” in Italian, because he
                    dragged one leg. If a man had a broad nose, they'd call him “Flat Nose” or
                    “Cross Eyes” or “Big Mouth.” In fact, Siad Barre, who, at the time I was there,
                    was the Army commander. In 1969 he led a coup d'etat and, for the next 22 years,
                    was the military dictator of Somalia. He was universally known among Somalis as
                    “Aphuain”, which means “Big Mouth.” That's what they called him. I don't know
                    whether it referred to his loquacity or just that he happened to have a large,
                    oral aperture. To an American this was a kind of appealing, national personality
                    characteristic.</p>
                <p>I used to contrast this with the situation in Ethiopia, which was very different.
                    The Ethiopians are very formal, very proper, very deferential, and very polite
                    and soft-spoken—extremely conscious of social class. They are very—what's the
                    word? “Devious” sounds too sinister but they are very convoluted in their
                    speech. You had to read between the lines to understand what they were saying.
                    By contrast, the Somalis were very straightforward. They told you exactly what
                    they thought. I mentioned Ethiopia because that was my next assignment.</p>
                <p>I was the junior officer in the Embassy [in Mogadishu] and I did a little bit of
                    everything. As the youngest officer they tried to get me to follow student
                    affairs, although there was no university, and it was a little hard to do that.
                    However, I used the fact that I had worked for the National Students
                    Association, which at that time was still known among African students as a very
                    liberal force in the United States, as a way of kind of ingratiating myself with
                    young people. This was on the somewhat naive assumption that they knew or cared
                    anything about American politics or that they made those kinds of distinctions.
                    I experienced a period of near panic in February, 1967, when I was listening to
                    the Voice of America one morning, over my cornflakes. I heard the announcer
                    state that the National Students Association had revealed that for the previous
                    20 or 25 years it had been subsidized by the Central Intelligence Agency. Of
                    course, this caused a great brouhaha back in the U. S. for days, because it
                    turned out to be the kind of loose thread that, when pulled, unraveled the whole
                    skein of other ventures by the Agency. It turned out that they were subsidizing
                    labor unions and youth and cultural organizations. They had this whole,
                    elaborate series of international operations that they were secretly funding. It
                    was not all as malign as it was made out to be. In a lot of areas it was simply
                    providing funding that was not available from private sources for organizations
                    which they felt would assist us in our world-wide cultural and political
                    confrontation with the Soviets. It created a great scandal in the U. S.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Anyhow, it turned out that, just as I had exaggerated the effect of my having
                    played this up before, the Somalis seemed equally indifferent to the fact, later
                    on, that it had all turned out to be an elaborate CIA operation. But that was a
                    moment of real fright for me during the first three months of my diplomatic
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at that time about the “Soviet
                        threat,” because this was a theme that ran through an awful lot of our
                        African policy. In Somalia from 1966-68, when you were there, how did people
                        view the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The Somalis were playing the East-West game very actively. This was,
                    perhaps, epitomized by the fact that the Somali Army was receiving training from
                    the Soviets, while the National Police force was under the tutelage of what was
                    then West Germany [the Federal Republic of Germany]. We used to joke about what
                    would happen when the confrontation came. Would “our” police be able to whip
                    “their” army? The Somalis didn't take any of this very seriously, on an
                    ideological level. They simply saw this situation as a way of maximizing their
                    bargaining position to obtain aid.</p>
                <p>We had quite a sizeable AID mission then. I think that there were probably 30 or
                    35 Americans. I don't remember what the dollar amount of the aid was, but it was
                    not insignificant. We had a large agricultural training program in a town called
                    Afgoy outside Mogadishu, we contributed to the police training program, and
                    there was a certain amount of public works assistance.</p>
                <p>The Russians had a larger presence there because of their role in training the
                    military. I should say not only the Russians, but the Chinese. I don't think
                    that there were North Koreans there, but there was a large Chinese contingent
                    handling grass roots projects. They built an assembly hall, a convention hall
                    where all national rallies took place. Of course, in 1967-68 China was still
                    totally off limits to the United States. We were not supposed to have anything
                    to do with the Chinese there. This was still when we were fighting a rear guard
                    action to keep Communist China out of the United Nations, when they were seen as
                    the “Yellow Peril.” I should say that this was before the Chinese Communists
                    abandoned any real effort to proselytize or fight the Cold War. They were out
                    there competing, both against us and against the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>There was a funny little vignette here. Every two years there was a major trade
                    fair in Mogadishu. All of the countries with which Somalia had diplomatic
                    relations had pavilions there, displayed their wares, and had cultural displays
                    and so forth. As it turned out, the American Pavilion was right in the center of
                    the fairgrounds, directly facing, nose to nose, the Chinese Pavilion. They were
                    about 20 yards apart. American Embassy officers were assigned, on a rotation
                    basis, to work in the American Pavilion as resource people, as guides through
                    the exposition, and so forth. I had the duty one evening—it was very quiet and
                    there were very few people in the pavilion. I was standing at the entrance to
                    the pavilion, looking across this open area or parade ground at the Chinese
                    Pavilion. You could look through the entrance and see a statue of Mao Zedong,
                    about eight feet high, brilliantly lit, with a crimson background behind it. It
                    was very alluring to me. I was really fascinated and drawn to see what was going
                    on in there. When my relief arrived at the American Pavilion, I very casually
                    strolled across this open ground and went into the Chinese Pavilion. I walked
                    around, looking at the various exhibits. It was like tasting forbidden fruit—a
                    16 year old kid going into a burlesque house. [Laughter] That was the feeling I
                    had, a very exotic, tantalizing taste of the unknown. I walked around, viewing
                    the various exhibits.</p>
                <p>As I neared the entrance, there was a table piled high with copies of Mao's
                    “Little Red Book,” the sayings of Chairman Mao. Even at the time these were kind
                    of banal cliches with which Mao exhorted his people. But in 1967 Mao was at the
                    zenith of his power and had the entire 600 million Chinese in his thrall,
                    memorizing his thoughts. Actually, it was called, “The Thoughts of Chairman
                    Mao.” The sayings were rather pretentious. Anyhow, I thought what a gas it would
                    be to pick up one of these books and have it around my office. I reached out to
                    take a copy of the book. I felt this hand come down and stop me. I turned
                    around, and there was a Chinese guy. He looked at me and said, “Where are you
                    from?” I guess that they had orders just like us, to stay away from the
                    Americans. I looked up and said, “Oh, I'm from Egypt.” He said, “Oh, all right.
                    I thought that you were an American.” I said, “No, no, my name is Mustafa. I'm
                    from the Egyptian Embassy.” This was the first name I came up with. So we got
                    into a conversation. I was, sweating bullets. You sweat there even when you're
                    not nervous. I managed to persuade the guy, although in retrospect I don't know
                    how that was possible. Mogadishu was a small town and people knew each other.
                    But I think that this guy was not from the Chinese Embassy. He was from Beijing,
                    or Peking, as it was known then.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Anyhow, the amusing part of the story is that, as I worked my way out of that and
                    left the Chinese Pavilion, a young Somali came up to me and started speaking to
                    me in Arabic. Well, I don't know Arabic but I recognized the language. It was
                    clear that he had overheard me, thought I was Egyptian, and wanted to practice
                    his Arabic on me. I must say, I was much more quick-witted in those days than I
                    am now. I very quickly said to him, in Somali, “Oh, please, since I'm in your
                    country, I would rather speak Somali. I am learning your language. I can speak
                    my language any time.” I'd been studying Somali. But he persisted in wanting to
                    speak Arabic. I said, “No, no, we must speak Somali.” I managed to extricate
                    myself after I had this brief, painful conversation in Somali. During the rest
                    of the time I was in Mogadishu, I kept running into this guy on the street. He
                    would call out to me, “Mustafa, Mustafa.” I was deathly afraid that he would see
                    me one day walking with the DCM or someone from the Embassy and have to explain.
                    But my luck held, and it never happened. As the attentive listener will begin to
                    perceive, I was a rather brash young Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this, of course, is some of the fun of the Foreign
                        Service. You're allowed to be brash in a lot of places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: We had a very traditional Ambassador and DCM, and I don't think that they
                    would have appreciated these antics if they had known about them at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about your first Ambassador and
                        DCM and how you got along with them. This was your first Embassy. How was it
                        run? The Ambassador was Raymond Thurston.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The Ambassador was Raymond Thurston. I'm not sure how old he was at that
                    time. He was completely white-haired, though, and very distinguished looking. He
                    loved to have people tell him that he looked like Spencer Tracy, which, in fact,
                    he did, to some extent. He was a fairly superficial person, I think. Well, I
                    won't get into personalities too much. I lived right next door to the DCM. He
                    was a fairly dour, relatively humorless person. He's still living around
                    Washington, so I won't give you his name. Ambassador Thurston has since died. I
                    think that they saw me as kind of brash and in need of some seasoning, fairly
                    quickly, which is why they gave me these lousy jobs to do. As I mentioned, my
                    first assignment was in AID for three months. The job involved basically
                    collating statistics of one sort or other. Then I came over to work in the
                    Economic Section of the Embassy for another three months, doing WTDR's (World
                    Trade Directory Reports), which are sort of real “scut work” in an Embassy.
                    People [in the U. S.] would be interested in importing from some company or
                    exporting to it and would inquire of the State Department about the company. We
                    would go out and do a report on the bona fides of the company. But in retrospect
                    all of this looks much more interesting and useful than it appeared at the time.
                    I wanted to be a political officer, I wanted to start doing political work right
                    away.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I was so young and I looked even younger, so people often took me for a Peace
                    Corps Volunteer. In fact, I felt much more at home with the Peace Corps
                    Volunteers than I did with other Embassy officers. But the Peace Corps
                    Volunteers were instructed not to hang around with Embassy people for the
                    opposite reasons. They didn't want any confusion among Somalis and wanted to
                    make sure that the Somalis understood that the Peace Corps didn't work for the
                    Embassy and therefore the Peace Corps Volunteers were not Embassy “agents.” They
                    were agents of the U. S. Government but they weren't there to gather
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>Then I did a six-month stint as consular officer, which, as it turned out, was
                    probably the most interesting work I did while I was there. This was because, at
                    a small post, one consular officer did everything—visa work, citizenship, and
                    passports. In addition to that I had the rather grandiloquent title of “Officer
                    in Charge of British Interests,” because the U. S. was the “protecting power”
                    for the U. K. [United Kingdom] in Somalia at that time. This arrangement was
                    made about in 1964, after Somalia broke diplomatic relations with the U. K. The
                    British, for reasons which no one has ever explained to me, had held a
                    referendum in the northeastern province or Northern Frontier District of Kenya,
                    as a part of preparing that country for independence. About 80 or 85% of the
                    population of this area was composed of ethnic Somalis. The referendum was held
                    there to see whether [the people wanted to be part of Kenya]. Somalia already
                    claimed all of the Somali speaking areas adjacent to it. To no one's surprise
                    the people voted overwhelmingly in favor of separating from Kenya and joining
                    Somalia. Whereupon the British said, in effect, “Thank you very much. Kenya will
                    get its independence in December, 1964, and the area in question will be part of
                    Kenya.” Not surprisingly, the Somalis took great exception to this. Some day
                    I've got to find out why the British did this, because obviously they had no
                    intention of honoring the wishes of the [Somali-speaking] residents [of the
                    Northern Frontier District]. Anyhow, at that point the Somalis broke diplomatic
                    relations with the British, and the U. S. became the protecting power.</p>
                <p>This meant that we took over protection of the welfare of British subjects and
                    British Protected Persons, as well as the properties of the British Mission
                    there. So, this meant for me that I got the British Ambassador's Land Rover,
                    complete with his driver, who picked me up at home every morning. I was probably
                    the only junior officer in all of Africa who had his own car and driver. I also
                    “liberated” the piano from the British Ambassador's residence, which was going
                    to rack and ruin there in the tropical heat. I had it moved for safekeeping to
                    my living room. There was a British War Graves Cemetery and a British Council
                    Library filled with termite bait. We finally liquidated the library because it
                    was being consumed by termites. Substantively, this additional assignment meant
                    that I handled all of Britain's consular interests throughout Somalia. I guess
                    the Embassy also handled British political interests, but this was done at a
                    higher, political level.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I had all sorts of interesting cases: shipwrecked sailors from the Maldive
                    Islands who washed up on the beach in Somalia and had to be repatriated to the
                    Maldives. Temporarily, we set up a tent camp for them. This was particularly
                    memorable. In fact, I've just written it up for THE FOREIGN SERVICE JOURNAL. It
                    will be in the next issue coming out next week. I'm not sure how much
                    this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this is very important to give us an idea of
                        what we were doing [in Somalia at that time].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: One Friday, I think, which was our day off—the Muslim Sabbath—I was down
                    at our beach club, which is where we all went when we had any free time. There
                    was, in fact, a great deal of free time because the Embassy only worked from
                    7:00 AM to 2:00 PM—we had the rest of the day off. I got a call from the Embassy
                    Duty Officer saying that they had had a call from the Police or someone who
                    reported that a British ship had been caught, violating Somali territorial
                    waters, and had been brought into the port of Mogadishu under guard. The captain
                    of the ship was demanding to see his consul—and that was me.</p>
                <p>So I went down to the port to the port captain's office. There, sitting before
                    me, was the commander of the Somali Army, Gen Mohammed Siad Barre, the commander
                    of the Somali Navy, and the captain of the port. They were grilling this
                    hapless, British captain, who had been on his way to Aden with a cargo of
                    potatoes for the then British garrison there. Aden was the site of a
                    considerable guerrilla war, with the British garrison trying to control the
                    unrest. The British left Aden a couple of years later, but it was a major
                    problem at the time. The ship's cargo of potatoes was a major part of British
                    Army rations at the time, I gather. The Somalis were convinced that this British
                    ship was the advance guard of the long-anticipated British invasion of Somalia.
                    Describing the Somalis as ethnocentric and xenophobic greatly understates their
                    obsession with their own importance. They were absolutely convinced that there
                    were British submarines offshore, ready to send waves of Marines onto the
                    beaches. Why they thought that a potato-carrying ship would be the vanguard of
                    such a force, I don't know. The British ship captain just wanted to get out of
                    Somalia and continue on his way to Aden. Over a two-day period they grilled the
                    captain. I don't mean that they tortured him, but they kept trying to get
                    information out of him. I was valiantly trying to play the role of a diplomat or
                    consul and to convince them that there was nothing sinister in all of that. He
                    had just happened to get too close to shore. He said that, in fact, he had not
                    been in their territorial waters. The upshot of this affair was that, over a
                    two-day period the cargo on the ship deteriorated very rapidly in the baking,
                    tropical sun. When they finally decided to let the ship go, the captain said
                    that the cargo had deteriorated too far and would never make it to Aden in
                    edible condition, so they dumped all of the potatoes on the quay in the port of
                    Mogadishu.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>It turned out, quite by coincidence, that there had been a shortage of potatoes
                    on the local market for the preceding two months. They didn't grow potatoes in
                    Somalia, and the whole supply depended on a ship that came from Italy every two
                    months. The total supply was not very large, because it was mostly expatriates
                    who ate potatoes, not Somalis. On the local expatriate cocktail circuit, that
                    was the subject of minor grumbling. We had pasta but no potatoes. When the word
                    got out that there was a load of potatoes which had just been dumped in the
                    port, every houseboy and market woman in town descended on the port and scooped
                    up the potatoes. For the next week all of us expatriates gorged ourselves on
                    potatoes, because they had to be eaten fairly quickly. The potatoes were just
                    about rotten. I call that “The Great Mogadishu Potato Caper.” This affair is
                    illustrative of the level of pettiness that diplomatic or consular work in out
                    of the way, provincial places like that can entail. We didn't have any really
                    major issues with the Somalis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, there was the Mau-Mau issue and the Ogaden
                        question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, the situation was pretty quiet. [Emperor] Haile Selassie was still
                    well entrenched on his throne [in Ethiopia]. There were little border skirmishes
                    from time to time, and, of course, the Somalis had asserted their claim, not
                    only to the Ogaden area but to the northern frontier area of Kenya, which I
                    referred to before, and to Djibouti as well, which was then known as French
                    Somaliland. In fact, the five points on the star at the center of the Somali
                    flag were said to represent the five segments of the Somali homeland, which had
                    been divided up. There were the three that I just mentioned [The Ogaden, the
                    northern frontier area of Kenya, and Djibouti], plus Italian Somaliland and
                    British Somaliland, which were merged together in 1960 when Somalia became an
                    independent country. Written right into their constitution was the goal of
                    reuniting into one country the five territories represented on the star. But
                    they were in no position to press their claims because they were much weaker,
                    militarily, than Ethiopia—or even Kenya. At that point the Somali Army only had
                    about 8,000 troops. It was quite small—a far cry from the 100,000 man Army they
                    ended up with after having successfully manipulated the Americans and the
                    Russians into arming them to the teeth. But when I was there, the Somalis were
                    no real threat. We had no particularly controversial matters at issue between
                    us. Our Embassy in Mogadishu, I suspect, was typical of the way most American
                    Embassies functioned in Africa at that time. We were concentrating on helping
                    them with economic development and keeping an eye on the Russians and the
                    Chinese, trying to make sure that they didn't get the upper hand.</p>
                <p>The Somalis had no ideological affinity with the Russians or the Chinese at all.
                    They were much too anarchic to be attracted to a centralized, political
                    philosophy. They seemed to have a kind of indigenous, democratic tradition. We
                    felt fairly good about the situation, even though the Russians were supplying
                    the Army. In Cold War terms we were certainly at least even with the Soviets.
                    Where it really counted, in the hearts and minds of the people, we were in a
                    stronger position.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I guess that the only real political strain—and it was significant—occurred over
                    the 1967 Middle East War, which took place about six months after I arrived
                    there.</p>

                    will recognize that event. That was the major conflict which occurred when
                    Israel took on three Arab countries [Egypt, Syria, and Jordan], thoroughly
                    defeated them all, and conquered the Sinai area, the West Bank [of the Jordan],
                    the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights. The Somalis were not, at that point,
                    members of the Arab League. They formally joined the League several years later.
                    However, it was a 100% Muslim country, right on the periphery of the Middle
                    East. It had very strong pro-Arab and anti-Israeli feelings. When the [1967] War
                    broke out, there were several demonstrations—I think that they were fairly
                    spontaneous—against the American Embassy, because we were seen as Israel's great
                    protector, although we had not intervened [in the fighting] at all. It was all
                    over before we ever had a chance or there was any need to intervene. But for a
                    period of six or seven days we were fairly worried. If the war had gone on for
                    much longer, this anti-Israel sentiment could well have jeopardized the American
                    Embassy. We were “locked down” during that time. We were told to stay home and
                    not move around town. I remember one demonstration—again, typical of the kind of
                    “Mickey Mouse” quality of the place. In Syria they burned down and ransacked the
                    Consulate. In Somalia the demonstrators were throwing rubber “Zoris” at the
                    American Embassy.</p>

                <p>KULICK: Thonged rubber sandals that everybody wore. That suggests the virulence
                    with which they demonstrated. In short, it wasn't very serious. They were just
                    going through the motions, I think. But in fact the government felt the need to
                    make some kind of demonstration of loyalty to the Arab cause. In the Friday
                    edition [equivalent of a Sunday edition in the U. S.] of the local, weekly
                    English language paper there was a headline across the top of the [front] page
                    that said, “Somalia to Send Troods to War.” The headline said “Troods” instead
                    of “Troops.” This was in large type, I might add—I'm holding my fingers about 2
                    � inches apart. That, to me, captured the essence of the place. They huffed and
                    puffed and came out with these ludicrous kinds of pronouncements. Fortunately,
                    the war was over before they could get their “troods” launched. They were going
                    to send some sort of token force, but the Israelis spared them the need to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>I recall that one person in the expatriate, American community was actually an
                    unmarried Jewish man from Aden who had lived in Somalia for many years. He ran
                    the Mobil Oil operation there. I'd gotten to know him. I guess that I hadn't
                    publicized the fact that I'd lived in Israel for a year and spoke Hebrew and so
                    forth. I remember Max getting in touch with me and asking me whether, if the
                    balloon went up, we would take care of him. He was widely assumed to be an
                    Israeli spy—and probably was. We were listening to short wave radio broadcasts
                    from Israel, following the course of the war, on a day by day basis. At the
                    beginning, of course...</p>

                <p>KULICK: It looked very bad. Here were the huge Egyptian, Jordanian, and Syrian
                    Armies poised on the borders of Israel, ready to attack. But within 48 hours, as
                    we listened to foreign broadcasts, things changed. The Somali Radio, of course,
                    was picking up broadcasts out of Cairo, which were still talking about glorious,
                    Egyptian victories.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KULICK: It was a very tense period for three or four days. I remember wondering
                    if we were going to have to be evacuated, because, of course, all of our
                    Missions in the Arab world were shut down. Suddenly, there was a great glut of
                    State Department Arabists on the [jobs] market [in the Foreign Service]. For
                    years thereafter there were Arabists walking the halls [of the State
                    Department]. I don't remember the figure, but we had 10 or 12 Embassies closed
                    down. In fact, one of the evacuees came to Mogadishu. I don't remember what they
                    gave him to do. There wasn't that much work to do, but [the Department] had to
                    find places for these people. That [the 1967 War] put a strain on our relations
                    with the Somalis for a while. But, again, they were pretty cynical about the
                    Arabs. They knew that the Arabs really didn't give a damn about them. Their
                    emotional commitment to the Arab cause was fairly superficial, I think.
                    Nevertheless, the spectacle of Israel conquering all of this Arab territory and
                    humiliating these Arab states did arouse a certain amount of passion among the
                    [Somali] political class. However, this passed fairly quickly. I don't remember
                    there being any long term consequences of the war.</p>
                <p>On the whole, though, it [my assignment to Somalia] was a very tranquil period.
                    It was a good place “to learn the ropes,” because I was able to take it all in
                    in a fairly leisurely kind of way.</p>

                <p>KULICK: I was studying Amharic. Before my tour in Somalia concluded, I was
                    assigned to the Embassy in Addis Ababa, in a language designated position which
                    required a year of Amharic training before I went. I was delighted. To me,
                    Ethiopia was the “big time” for an Africanist. It was the headquarters of the
                    OAU and the oldest African country.</p>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KULICK: I suspect that it may not really be so united. I was quite pleased with
                    the assignment. It was considered a “plum” for an Africanist. It meant coming
                    back to Washington for a fairly short time, which my wife wasn't terribly happy
                    about. That's a motif that was repeated throughout my Foreign Service career,
                    because I had told her that as a reward for sweating it out in Somalia for a
                    couple of years I would get us an assignment in Rome or Europe or someplace like
                    that. Why I thought I could make such a promise, I don't know. I guess that what
                    I meant was that I would try. She heard the commitment and held me to it. As it
                    turned out, she loved Ethiopia and had a wonderful time there. There were no
                    long-term recriminations about it, except for the fact that I hadn't consulted
                    her properly. That, in itself, was a black mark on my record. I was in
                    Washington for about nine months. The course was for 10 months. I left after
                    about eight and one-half months because I was anxious to get out to the post.

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I was lucky. There were only two people in the class, and the teacher was
                    excellent. I have a lot of linguistic aptitude. I had gotten myself up to a
                    level of 2 or 2+ in Somali, just studying with a local teacher. There was no FSI
                    program and no course material. I sort of made it all up. I've subsequently
                    forgotten Somali completely, but it was fun learning the language. It was always
                    delightful to surprise Somalis with my ability to speak their language a little.
                    Of course, in one case it justified [the effort]. It saved my neck!</p>
                <p>We went out to Ethiopia in the summer of 1969. We were there for three years. I

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Historians would call it a “fin de regime” period. In retrospect it was
                    clearly the tail end of the Haile Selassie era. We were pretty conscious of
                    that. But as we were saying earlier, people were thinking that they were at the
                    end of the regime for a dozen years—at least since 1960 when there had been a
                    coup against Haile Selassie when he was out of the country. The United States,
                    in effect, helped him reverse the coup. We brought him back from Brazil where
                    he'd been on a state visit. We didn't intervene militarily but we made it clear
                    that he had our full backing. We brought him back, reinstalled him in Addis
                    Ababa, and the coup collapsed. From 1960 on that was all borrowed time. He
                    didn't use it very well. The whole thrust of our policy toward Ethiopia during
                    that period was ostensibly, at least, pushing the emperor to prepare for the
                    transition, to prepare for the next generation, to encourage democratic forces,
                    to bring in new leadership, to prepare the country for a much more open,
                    democratic system after he left power.</p>

                <p>As Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen might say, his son was no Haile Selassie. He
                    was a very weak sort of character. Most people thought that he would be a
                    figurehead, and the question was, who would be the real power in the country?
                    Unlike Somalia, we had what we considered to be important, strategic interests
                    in Ethiopia. Not just because of its position at the entrance to the Red Sea, it
                    was one of the largest, most prestigious countries in Africa. It was also the
                    location of a major military communications relay station.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kagnew Station.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Kagnew Station. We pronounced it “Kagnew Kanyo”. Kagnew Station, in
                    Asmara, which we had operated since the end of World War II. The Italians had
                    been expelled from there in the early 1940's. The British operated [the station]
                    at first, and then they turned it over to us. Our military swore that it was an
                    absolutely critical link in our global communications chain. I think that it was
                    a large, NSA type of operation. Q: You mean the National Security Agency, which
                    is essentially listening to...</p>

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. But it was also used in the early years of satellite communications.
                    There were satellite relay stations. I never really knew exactly what went on
                    there, but the [U. S.] military insisted that it was utterly indispensable and
                    that our policy could do nothing that would jeopardize our presence at Kagnew
                    Station. Well, as has happened far, far too frequently in American history, our
                    fixation on that kind of thing in many ways contributed to our loss of it, by
                    completely or largely depriving our policy of a balance and perspective that it
                    might have had, had we not been held hostage to [Kagnew Station]. That
                    experience gave me a perspective which I have seen repeated over and over in my
                    years [in the Foreign Service]. The United States, for all its clear
                    superiority, militarily and economically, and its role as a super power—somehow
                    we have often felt hostage to these small countries and have felt somehow that
                    we needed them more than they needed us. I never quite figured out why it is
                    that a country that can dominate the world, as we did, is often so deferential
                    to these little countries because they have a communications station or they
                    have an...</p>

                <p>KULICK: Airfield or something that we regarded as indispensable, when clearly, it
                    seemed to me then, and still seems to me, they needed us more than we needed
                    them. We were in a far more advantageous position than we gave ourselves credit
                    for. I don't mean that we should have used [these facilities] to abuse these
                    countries. We should have used them in ways that actually would have served
                    their interests by encouraging democratization or greater openness. I guess the
                    Shah [of Iran] was the most egregious example of that sort of thing, where [that
                    kind of] policy went sour. Here we had a figure considered so critical to our
                    interests in the Middle East—and yet, clearly, he was much more dependent on us
                    than we were dependent on him. [I think that] we could have “moved” him much
                    more forcefully than we did to create conditions which, in fact, would have
                    strengthened his position in the long term. Or, to put it the other way around,
                    would have limited the growth of the kind of forces that ended up bringing him
                    down. But we were scared to death of doing anything that might upset him.</p>
                <p>I guess the Philippines is another example, with Marcos. We had these bases there
                    and, even though they were critical to the survival of that regime, they would
                    have done all kinds of things to accommodate us. Our view was that we couldn't
                    do anything to put pressure on them because they would kick us out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That was the tail that wagged the dog. It was a source of a lot of
                    frustration, particularly among the more junior people in the Embassy [in Addis
                    Ababa], because we could all see that the result of this [attitude] was a
                    failure to employ the kind of influence that we could have used to step up the
                    pace of “democratization.” That's something of an anachronism. Actually, that
                    wasn't the term that was used then. Now it's kind of a standard phrase for what
                    we're trying to do to encourage greater political participation. Of course,
                    failure to do that led to this buildup of pressure beneath the surface which
                    exploded when finally Haile Selassie became so weak and more or less senile that
                    he could no longer keep the lid on things. Rather than these enlightened forces
                    that we had been encouraging him to bring along, the vacuum was filled by junior
                    military officers who were totally frustrated by their inability to move ahead,
                    [in view of] the leadership's unwillingness to promote serious economic
                    liberalization and land reform. It [Ethiopia] was still a feudal society in many
                    ways. The evolution [of events] bypassed this intermediate stage between
                    absolute monarchy and liberal democracy. It bypassed the stage of rule by
                    enlightened bureaucrats, swept them all aside, and installed aradical, Marxist
                    dictatorship.</p>

                <p>But there was a lot of ferment within the Embassy. On several occasions there

                    think. He had been a career AID officer. Actually, not career. He'd come into
                    AID at mid-career. He had had a fairly distinguished career in AID and then he
                    was the Administrative Counselor in London. I don't know what he did after that,
                    but he was appointed Ambassador to Ethiopia in 1967 or 1968. The previous
                    Ambassador had been a journalist by the name of Edward Korry, who was a very
                    abrasive, outspoken type. He had been quite critical of the [Haile Selassie]
                    regime. Not surprisingly, the Ethiopians were not very enamored of him. He
                    wasn't “recalled” in a formal sense, but I think that the Ethiopians made it
                    clear that they wanted an Ambassador who was a little less abrasive and less
                    undiplomatic. So they got Ambassador Hall, who was more in the traditional
                    [ambassadorial] mold.</p>
                <p>All of the policy papers and the country assessments and so forth made the point
                    that Haile Selassie was winding down and that we needed to do everything we
                    could to ensure a smooth transition. But we really were kind of halfhearted
                    about it. I think that that led to the 1974 coup d'etat which happened after I
                    left. We spent a lot of time informally “gaming” [the situation] among
                    ourselves—this question which you referred to earlier. What would be the
                    scenario which would govern Haile Selassie's departure? No one really expected
                    that it would come from the junior ranks of the military. We thought that either
                    the senior military would take over or there would be widespread, ethnic,
                    separatist movements, which happened a lot later. But the idea of a young,
                    radical, Marxist, military faction taking over the country really had not
                    occurred to us. I think that that is because we had had very little contact with
                    the junior ranks of the military. We spent a lot of time watching students,
                    because they were there in the capital, very visible, and very radical.</p>
                <p>We had a large, CIA “Station” that poured out astounding amounts of material on
                    student movements. They clearly were convinced that this was where the real
                    trouble was going to come from, because the [students] were open, overt,
                    radical, and a source of constant agitation. However, as it turned out, they
                    were really irrelevant. They were swept aside along with the aristocracy. It was
                    the Marxist soldiers who took over. The students were real Marxists. They were
                    opposed to military rule. When the military came in, they had no contact
                    whatever with these young, idealistic radicals who proceeded to slaughter large
                    numbers of [the students]. So we really missed that whole phenomenon. We missed
                    predicting it.</p>

                <p>KULICK: I was the Amharic language officer in the Embassy, so my “beat” was among
                    those sectors in society which were somewhat less sophisticated and less
                    articulate in English. I covered the student scene, the Parliament—and there was
                    a Parliament of sorts there. I did provincial reporting. I did a lot of
                    traveling around the countryside, talking to priests, farmers, local
                    administrators, and so forth. I had a wonderful time. I thought that this was
                    why I joined the Foreign Service. This was what it was all about. I wrote long
                    airgrams on the changing role of the [Coptic] Church in Ethiopia and had
                    voluminous biographic files on every member of Parliament, student leaders, and
                    others. I didn't deal with higher politics. That was done at the level of the
                    Ambassador, the DCM, and the Political Counselor. I really worked at the “grass
                    roots” level. I must confess that even I didn't discern that the junior military
                    were going to come...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't this always the problem? The junior military is the
                        hardest place [to contact]. This has happened again and again, throughout
                        the world. It's the hardest [group] for an Embassy to penetrate—even for our
                        attach�s. They usually are talking at one level. The people who are going to
                        pull that type of coup d'etat probably are less sophisticated and aren't
                        going to be the ones who will be talking to [our military attach�s].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, but I think that in Africa, at least, military intervention usually
                    came from the top. There wasn't much precedent for [a coup by junior officers].
                    Later you had Sgt Doe in Liberia and people like that. But generally it was the
                    Army commander, although Libya [was a different example].</p>

                        on. We thought that in 1967 the generals were all set for their coup.
                        Instead, the colonels took the generals' plan and staged a coup against the
                        generals.</hi>

                <p>KULICK: I had a very rude awakening when I came back from Addis Ababa and was
                    assigned to the Department. I went around to the [Ethiopian] desk, thinking that
                    they would want to debrief me and extract all of the knowledge that I had
                    acquired there. They didn't seem to be very interested. I thought that they had
                    at least benefited from all the reporting I'd done. I made reference to a couple
                    of the reports I was particularly proud of having prepared—these long,
                    analytical airgrams. I was absolutely crestfallen to discover that not only did
                    they notremember them but, in many cases, they probably hadn't even read them! I
                    was doing great work for some kind of doctoral dissertation, but most of this
                    stuff was completely irrelevant as far as the Department was concerned. But
                    there was never any critique. I never got any feedback from the Department,
                    saying something like, “This is nice, but we're not interested in it.” I had
                    trouble finding people in INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research] who read the
                    stuff very closely. The analyst for Ethiopia had read them, but I don't think
                    that the Director of the Office of Research for Africa had read them. They were
                    probably right. It probably was largely irrelevant. I'm not suggesting that if
                    they'd read these reports, we would have been able to avert the disaster that
                    befell our policy in Ethiopia. I wonder whether junior reporting officers get
                    better guidance [elsewhere].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect not. You never turn somebody off. But at the

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: There's just too much information. I was sorry to see the airgram format
                    abolished. Not that it was that much better, coming [into the Department] by
                    pouch than by cable. When you deal with cables, there's a limit to what you feel
                    you can comfortably write—though maybe less so than now, when it's become so
                    automated. [When I was in Ethiopia], you wouldn't sent a 10-page telegram. It
                    would be too much of a burden on the communicators.</p>

                        mentioned that the Ethiopians were different from the Somalis, but how were
                        your contacts with the people you met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I dealt a lot with members of Parliament. It was kind of a rubber stamp
                    operation, but it did have representatives from all over the country. If you got
                    to know them, outside of their official capacity, you were able to get a sense
                    of how life was like outside the capital. For the most part it was quite
                    quiescent. This was not a bubbling cauldron of political discontent. Ethiopian
                    society was still largely traditional and intact. It was beginning to
                    change.</p>
                <p>Interestingly enough, and if one gains nothing else from this tape, it might be
                    this observation. I think that the advent of the Peace Corps had a great deal to
                    do with the change which Ethiopia underwent. I can't speak for the rest of
                    Africa, particularly, but in the case of Ethiopia the Peace Corps hit that
                    country like a tidal wave. That exaggerates [the impact] in terms of the
                    physical scope of it, but psychologically and culturally it had an enormous
                    impact because here was a country which was still largely feudal in its social
                    structure and very backward. It had a very primitive kind of school system. On
                    the whole, the teachers were a fairly timid lot. All of a sudden, in the early
                    1960's, you got 200-300 young, idealistic Americans moving around the country,
                    assigned to every secondary school in the country, I think—virtually without
                    exception. They came from an atmosphere of great, political ferment in the
                    United States. The Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-War Movement, the Kennedy
                    period—these highly mobilized youth. And here they were, sent off to a country
                    that had no experience with that kind of outspokenness, that kind of challenge
                    of authority which was the life blood of young Americans in those days. I'm not
                    suggesting that they went out, preaching revolution or anything like that. But
                    just by their very example, just by their teaching these [Ethiopian] kids about
                    the U. S. constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human
                    Rights in the United Nations, and what was going on in the rest of Africa—to say
                    nothing of what was going on in the United States—you had this sudden, sharp
                    increase in expectations among young Ethiopians, with no real prospect of those
                    expectations being satisfied. That had a very destabilizing effect on
                    [Ethiopian] society, I think.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Again, this was done with the best of intentions. But you had a corps of people
                    who were infusing ideas and creating expectations which the society was not
                    equipped to handle. I think that this certainly spilled over into the military.
                    After all, junior [Ethiopian] military officers were people who had a secondary
                    education of some sort. They took this experience with them into the military,
                    and it didn't take a whole lot of brains to see that the high school students
                    could do something about the situation. This had everything to do with the
                    radicalization of the university population. Unfortunately and ironically, much
                    of this agitation took the form of anti-Americanism. These kids who readily
                    acknowledged that they got their education and ideas from American teachers
                    nevertheless “leapfrogged” over that and went way beyond...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they turn on America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Because we were in this anomalous position. Here we had these students
                    out there—these young Americans out there, teaching them about democracy,
                    economic development, and the free expression of political ideas. At the same
                    time, we were the principal supporters—in fact, the sole political supporters—of
                    the Haile Selassie regime. They [the Ethiopian students] said, “Here you've come
                    over to tell us about democracy, and yet you're supporting the regime which
                    prevents the emergence of democracy in our country.” So, even though, in a real
                    sense, they owed all of their political knowledge and awareness to Americans,
                    they looked upon America as a retrograde force in Ethiopia. A lot of the Peace
                    Corps Volunteers were bewildered by all of this. They thought that they had been
                    sent out there to help these people and give them the means to move into the
                    modern world and to create a modern society—and the [Ethiopian] students were
                    turning on them. And turn on them they did. The Peace Corps had to be
                    withdrawn—even from small, provincial towns—because the students were throwing
                    rocks at them, attacking them, and really making life impossible for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>These [impressions] were from my last year [in Ethiopia], 1972, which was the
                    zenith of the anti-American feeling. The government had to consider closing the
                    university down, sent troops onto the campus a couple of times, and shot some
                    students. It really was quite ugly. Meanwhile, the United States was
                    dithering—not really knowing what to do about all this. Of course, the Emperor
                    and his entourage played the Kagnew Station card to the hilt. Ironically, and
                    again, I think that this was a major turning point, in 1971 Ambassador Hall
                    completed his tour and was replaced by a recently defeated, Republican
                    Congressman from Indiana, named E. Ross Adair, as Ambassador. He was a man with
                    no diplomatic experience and no imagination whatsoever. I'm sure that Sinclair
                    Lewis [the author] must have [thought of someone like] Ross Adair when he wrote
                    “Babbitt.” He was a real “Babbitt” kind of figure and was being paid off for 20
                    years of loyal service to the Republican Party in Congress with this
                    ambassadorship. This was a wholly inappropriate appointment at a time when
                    everybody could see that our relations with Ethiopia were at a critical point.
                    What we needed was a strong American Ambassador who could really “kick ass” and
                    exercise the influence that was ours to deploy at that point. Instead, they sent
                    this—well, there's no purpose in using pejorative adjectives at this point. He
                    just was not at all up to the job. He had a DCM who was a martinet and utterly
                    devoid of any imagination—the classic bureaucrat of a DCM. It was really in that
                    period when things began to spin out of control in Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>I'm not saying that if we'd had the right American Ambassador there—if we'd had
                    Tom Pickering there, for example—he could have singlehandedly rescued the
                    situation. But I really have little doubt that the absence of a strong U. S.
                    Ambassador and a coherent policy [affected the situation]. Those two conditions
                    are not necessarily identical, though they are part and parcel of the same
                    thing. This reflected a phenomenon of neglect of a very important area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this affect you as a reporting officer at the

                        area. It's almost endemic to the system. The more senior people deal at the
                        policy level and tend to follow that, whereas the younger officers get out
                        on the street more often and are in contact with the students and some of
                        the “castoffs” of the political system. This is the younger officers'
                        bailiwick, and they're seeing a different reality.</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>KULICK: Well, fortunately, the Political Counselor was not so much personally in
                    touch [with such groups], but he respected my access and my perspective. Of
                    course, junior officers don't make policy recommendations. They report the
                    facts, and the policy recommendations are in the hands of people further up the
                    line. So I didn't find myself butting heads over policy, although on several
                    occasions I did take issue with the more general drift of our policy, rather
                    than with specific policies. I felt that we needed to be more vigorous, we
                    needed to be much more pointed in our discourse, and move things ahead, such as
                    pressing ahead on land reform. Most of the land was held by a few aristocratic
                    landowners and the [Coptic] Church. Most of the people who worked the land were
                    landless, tenant farmers. This clearly was going to be a source of great
                    instability. We wanted to use the leverage inherent in the aid program or the
                    military assistance program to pursue those kinds of objectives. We were
                    unwilling to link levels of aid with performance on the political level. I can
                    recall putting together several memoranda, which got a respectful hearing, but
                    that's all.</p>
                <p>In 1975 the Eritrean Liberation Front was laying siege to Asmara and was very
                    close to capturing the place, which would essentially have led to the secession
                    of Eritrea. The Ethiopians came to us in a panic, asking for emergency military
                    aid. I took the position that, in the long run, there was no military solution
                    to the Eritrean situation. The war had been going on for 10 years and, while we
                    had some obligation to support them as a long term ally, we should place very
                    tight strings on this aid. We should say that we would help them out now to
                    prevent the government from going down to military defeat, but only if the
                    government would use that respite to pursue a political, a compromise solution.
                    That would mean that they would have to accord a lot of autonomy to Eritrea.
                    Well, that idea was not accepted [in the Embassy]. We did provide aid, although
                    not in the amounts that they had asked for or even in the amounts that we had
                    initially intended to give them. But the basic notion of “quid pro quo” was not
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>We had discussions like that, having more to do with the economic rather than the
                    military aid program while I was at the Embassy [in Addis Ababa]. There were not
                    many head to head confrontations. We more or less recognized that it was part of
                    the culture—the younger officers were going to take a more activist posture in a
                    case like this than the senior leadership of the Embassy, although, again, the
                    senior leadership was so unimaginative and so timid that it went beyond the kind
                    of situation typical in an embassy. It had very sad consequences for our
                    relations with Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Addis Ababa in 1972 and you came back to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, I figured that it was time to get back to Washington. I had been
                    overseas for two tours and had not had any time in Washington. As I mentioned
                    earlier, my reporting had essentially been from the field. I realized that going
                    off to the field without having time in Washington really puts you at a
                    disadvantage. You have no idea how things really work in Washington. In fact, I
                    would support the idea of perhaps sending someone overseas for his first tour,
                    but the second tour should really be back in Washington.</p>
                <p>I was really very interested in environmental affairs then—and now. It was my
                    sort of second “love” after foreign policy. I still wasn't sure that I was
                    committed, on a long term basis, to the State Department. The Vietnam War was
                    still going on, and I hadn't really been in the Foreign Service long enough to
                    be at the point of no return. I felt that an assignment in environmental affairs
                    would give me a chance to develop another string to my bow. If I decided that I
                    wanted to do something else, this would be kind of a bridge to things outside
                    the Foreign Service. In addition to its being a new and exciting addition to our
                    foreign policy, this was the year of the UN Conference on the Environment in
                    Stockholm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People were just beginning...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: This was the first real effort to develop global awareness of the
                    environmental issue. When I was on home leave in 1971, I went around and lobbied
                    fairly heavily for a job in environmental affairs when I came back from Addis
                    Ababa. In those days we didn't have “open assignments.” The Department didn't
                    have the whole, elaborate system of “bids” for given positions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You either took what you got or you did a little
                        investigating on your own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, anybody worth his salt could have gone out and tried to find
                    himself a job [in the Department]. The truth is that, despite all of the “open
                    assignment” refinements and folderol, that still is the way things work. In
                    fact, I think quite firmly, that the Foreign Service is kind of a Darwinian
                    system, but it works reasonably well. The best people get the best jobs and, by
                    and large, the weaker people get the lesser jobs.</p>
                <p>This is kind of a digression here, but I think that the concept of “open
                    assignments” was a great innovation and is very important just to ensure that
                    there aren't too many “side deals” made that keep “outsiders” out. However, by
                    and large, this simply routinized or regularized the basic, prevailing
                    principle, which is that the good guys get the best jobs. Obviously, they have
                    the most bargaining power. They're the most...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sought after.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>KULICK: Sought after. The less sought after get the leftovers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The best jobs usually mean more of a chance for promotion.
                        But that's the way the system should work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It's kind of Darwinian, but after all Darwinian is not necessarily a
                    negative term. It's a term that accurately describes how the species evolved.
                    Anyhow, I wanted very much to get this job in environmental affairs. At the time
                    this office was still in a fledgling state. They didn't know how many jobs they
                    would have and they couldn't make me any promises. But I continued the
                    correspondence after I got back to Ethiopia. The long and the short of it was
                    that I was assigned to this office and was delighted. At about this time, in
                    fact, the DCM in Addis Ababa told me that he could help me get a job in the
                    Executive Secretariat. He was sure that he could arrange it. I told him that I
                    wasn't interested. He was appalled. He said, “You don't understand. That's your
                    ticket to rapid advancement and success in the Foreign Service.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got your job with the Office of Environmental
                        Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, I came in just after the Stockholm Conference. For me it was the
                    perfect kind of working environment. The office was composed mostly of people
                    who, like myself, had volunteered for these jobs, because they really were
                    interested in the subject. There was no pool of environmental officers to draw
                    from. Everybody who was there was more or less self-nominated, to one degree or
                    another. Again, I was the most junior officer in the office. I was beginning to
                    think that, wherever I went, I was always going to be the youngest guy
                    there.</p>
                <p>I had the “Bilateral” portfolio in that office. That is, I was responsible for
                    handling bilateral environmental issues with Mexico and Canada, primarily, but
                    also environmental cooperation agreements we had with the Soviet Union and with
                    Japan. The rest of the office dealt with the UN system, including global
                    environmental issues like ocean dumping, marine pollution, and that kind of
                    thing, whereas I was assigned work dealing with bilateral issues that might
                    affect our bilateral relations in a few instances. It was a thoroughly
                    fascinating, challenging, and enjoyable job, although, again, I kept trying to
                    explain to people that I asked for this. In those days—and probably even still
                    today—the perception was that a place like the Science Bureau was kind of where
                    the losers hang out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A parking place.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>KULICK: It didn't bother me that people might think like that because that was
                    what I really wanted to do, whereas my really ambitious colleagues were the ones
                    who were on the line and in the Executive Secretariat, or looking for jobs in
                    the European Bureau or something like that. Who knows? Maybe they were right.
                    Maybe it did affect my career. I don't know. However, as I said, I looked upon
                    this, not only in its own terms, but as a possible avenue toward doing things
                    outside the State Department in the environmental field. As it turned out, I
                    concluded that I really did enjoy the diplomatic side of things and didn't
                    really, actively look for alternatives outside the State Department.</p>
                <p>As I say, I handled the diplomatic, as opposed to the scientific side of the
                    cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union. This was an agreement that
                    President Nixon had signed when he went to Moscow in early 1972. It was one of
                    the first fruits of detente. It turned out to be one of the most enduring fruits
                    of detente, because even when detente went sour and we were back to
                    confrontation in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the environmental cooperation
                    agreement just ticked right along. Scientists continued to work productively
                    together, and, I think, probably still do, although I'm not sure what the status
                    of it is now. On a wide variety of issues—air pollution, wildlife management,
                    migratory water fowl, marine mammals, you name it—we had a sub-agreement under
                    this umbrella accord where Russian and American scientists were working
                    together. There even was one agreement on the legal and administrative aspects
                    of environmental protection. That was put in there so that guys like me would
                    have an excuse to make a trip to Russia. Indeed, I took a three week trip to the
                    Soviet Union while in that job, which was certainly one of the highlights of my
                    Foreign Service experience.</p>
                <p>The year before I had hosted a Russian delegation which had come to the U. S. to
                    deal with these administrative and legal questions. I took them around the
                    country, to Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. They met with
                    professors of environmental law and local EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]
                    officials. They took a lot of notes and asked a lot of questions but never
                    offered anything in return. Then when I escorted an American delegation to the
                    Soviet Union, our delegation went around from place to place in the Soviet
                    Union. The Russians took a lot of notes and asked a lot of questions but didn't
                    give a whole lot back. [Laughter] But it was a very productive period. I did
                    things like write the environmental impact statement on an LPG (Liquefied
                    Petroleum Gas) pipeline that needed a permit. For some reason the rules said
                    that LPG pipelines had to get permits from the State Department, not from the
                    Federal Power Commission or whoever else dealt with other energy matters. The
                    pipelines had to get a permit to cross the border. That was the point at which
                    we came in. There had to be an environmental impact statement, and I was the guy
                    who wrote it, although I was not a scientist. It was great fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We had several, cross border pollution problems with Canada that occupied a great
                    deal of my time. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was a truly major issue
                    between the United States and Canada. We had negotiated and signed with the
                    Canadians a multi-year, multi-objective agreement for improving the quality of
                    water in the Great Lakes. This involved targets for the reduction of phosphates
                    and agricultural runoff, sewage treatment, and all that kind of thing. EPA
                    handled the technical side of things. We in the State Department handled the
                    diplomatic aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What major sticking points did you find? Were American or
                        foreign business the problem or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was just an exceedingly complex agreement. It involved dozens of state
                    and local jurisdictions and agricultural, industrial, and municipal interests.
                    It wasn't so much that we were fighting concerted opposition. It was just a
                    matter of trying to pull all of this together. We didn't do all of this
                    coordination, but we dealt with Canadian concerns about non-compliance on our
                    side and carried our concern to Canada about Canadian non-compliance or
                    difficulties in compliance, such as adhering to time tables and that kind of
                    thing. I made a couple of trips to Ottawa for consultations on that. Farther
                    West the problems had to do with cross border, river, or air pollution. We had a
                    big lead smelter in Idaho or Montana which blew lead, arsenic, and all kinds of
                    things into Canada. Not surprisingly, the Canadians were very exercised about
                    that. It turned out that they had a smelter on their side of the border which
                    blew stuff over onto our side. We were able at least to counter their
                    indignation.</p>
                <p>There was one issue which I became very much involved in, a massive reclamation
                    and irrigation project in North Dakota, called the Garrison Diversion Project.
                    It had literally been going on since the 1930's. It involved building a number
                    of huge dams and diverting the Missouri River into vast irrigation projects,
                    most of which didn't concern the Canadians because they were largely on the U.
                    S. side. However, there was one little river there that flowed down from Canada
                    into the U. S. and flowed back into Canada. It was called the Souris River. It
                    made a loop. One aspect of the Garrison Diversion Project involved diverting
                    water from the watershed of the Missouri River, over the mountains, and into the
                    watershed of the river which flowed into Canada. This involved a huge amount of
                    agricultural runoff into this river and the introduction of exotic species. It
                    had a lot of ecological implications. The Canadians had made a number of
                    diplomatic representations to us about this project. As the State Department is
                    always accused of doing, we took our “client's” concerns as our concerns. This
                    project was very controversial in the environmental and even the agricultural
                    community. It was a gigantic “pork barrel” project that ended up subsidizing the
                    farmers up there to the tune of about $100,000 per irrigated acre. It was just
                    an outrageous waste of resources. We were spending roughly $100,000 an acre to
                    reclaim agricultural land to grow crops which were in surplus and then were
                    bought and stuck into warehouses. There were several millionaire North Dakota
                    farmers that were getting rich out of this project, with very little benefit to
                    anyone.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Along with a lot of other people we lobbied the Interior Department. The Interior
                    Department was very eager to win us over and prove to us what a really
                    beneficial project this was. So they took five or six—more than that—about a
                    dozen people from the State Department, from EPA, and from various other
                    government agencies that had problems with this project, flew us up to Minot,
                    North Dakota, and put on a three day “dog and pony show,” taking us around to
                    all of these irrigation projects, flying us over them, and showing us what a
                    beautiful green it was, whereas the area not included in it was all brown and
                    parched. Leaving aside the fact that the crops being grown were surplus to our
                    needs, anyway. They gave us extended explanations that the Canadians were not
                    going to be affected by all of this. It didn't win anybody over that I can
                    recall, but it was a very graphic demonstration of how government agencies “log
                    roll” and lobby each other. I hadn't realized that that kind of thing went on.
                    What was really memorable for me was that I was in Minot, North Dakota, the day
                    that President Richard Nixon resigned, in 1974. I watched his resignation speech
                    at a hotel in North Dakota. That was probably the most memorable part of the
                    trip.</p>
                <p>I really did enjoy it and had as much achievement to show for that assignment as
                    almost anything that I did later on, because this involved dealing with real
                    issues and practical interests. It wasn't more abstract and intangible stuff
                    such as Foreign Service Officers spend so much of their careers dealing
                    with.</p>
                <p>I did similar things on the border with Mexico—problems with untreated sewage
                    flowing into the U. S. in Tijuana and problems in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
                <p>The technical cooperation agreements with the Soviets produced not only political
                    detente. This was one of the few areas where the Russians had some specific
                    things to offer us that we could profit from. As in all of the agreements, they
                    got a lot more from us than we got from them, but it wasn't a wholly one-sided
                    thing.</p>
                <p>I guess that the high point of that particular tour was the two weeks that I
                    spent as a rapporteur at an international conference, which we had promoted,
                    about commercial trade in endangered species. It was convened in Washington to
                    draft a treaty. It was a plenipotentiary conference held at the State Department
                    in the Diplomatic Conference area there. There were delegates from 40 or 50
                    countries in attendance. This was partly a result of the Stockholm Conference.
                    The purpose was to draft a treaty which would control or lay down rules and
                    conditions for the trade in endangered species. The meeting ran for two weeks. I
                    was one of the rapporteurs at the meeting, meaning that I took notes and
                    produced records of the discussions at the end of the day.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>To me it was an utterly fascinating experience. It was the only experience I've
                    had like that, watching a treaty go from start to finish. There had been
                    preparatory committees which had produced a basic draft. This meeting didn't
                    start with a blank piece of paper but rather with an outline of a treaty—or
                    maybe even a draft that had been produced by working groups. The central issue
                    was what species would be designated for protection, what mechanisms would be
                    set up for adding additional species to the list as time goes on, new threats to
                    new species of wildlife as they emerge, and what rules would govern trade. That
                    is, should we ban trade entirely, should we try to put limits on numbers, what
                    kind of certification would be required by countries on wildlife being imported,
                    and so forth. I think that it could have been a case study. Someone could have
                    prepared a wonderful documentary on how a treaty is produced. There were plenary
                    groups meeting in the afternoon and working groups meeting in the morning,
                    considering different pieces of the treaty, finally piecing it all together at
                    the end.</p>
                <p>What emerged at the end of two weeks was a convention on the international trade
                    in species of wild fauna and flora. That was the full name of the treaty.
                    Today—almost 20 years later—it is a major instrument in the effort to protect
                    wildlife and prevent the destruction of species of wildlife. It's been
                    considerably strengthened since that initial text was produced. I think that
                    that's very often the case. You start with the lowest common denominator and, as
                    time goes on, people become more used to it, see how it works, and are prepared
                    to extend its provisions and make them tougher, particularly in connection with
                    environmental agreements. To me it was a fascinating experience. Certainly, at
                    that point—and maybe up to the very end—it was the thing I could point to as the
                    most satisfying experience I had had, even though I was just a small cog.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were still part of the action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: In fact, as a rapporteur, I suppose you could say that I was really just
                    an observer, although I did participate in some of the work. However, the
                    satisfaction came from the knowledge that this had real, measurable, important
                    consequences for the quality of life on earth. To me that's what all of this is
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's what all of what we do is about. Often it's just much harder to
                    measure. I suppose that if I'd worked on the SALT II treaty and had come out at
                    the end of that with a treaty that had...</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KULICK: ...materially made the world a safer place, I would have the same kind of
                    sense. I think that that's what keeps an awful lot of us going and motivated, in
                    the sense that we're making a real difference. And not in a narrow, chauvinistic
                    kind of way, such as making the world safer for General Motors. I think that
                    most Foreign Service Officers are not at all motivated by that kind of narrow,
                    nationalistic, self-interested kind of thing. We are, on the whole, a pretty
                    idealistic lot, in my experience.</p>
                <p>But that sums up the two years I spent in environmental affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: 1972 to 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then for a year...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. We still didn't have open assignments. I had kept in touch with the
                    Office of East African Affairs during this time and knew that they were looking
                    for a desk officer for Somalia. I think that they approached me and asked me if
                    I wanted to have the job. With very little hesitation I took it. I was desk
                    officer for Somalia and assistant desk officer for Ethiopia, which was a much
                    bigger job. By this time the Somali Government had been overthrown and its
                    military dictatorship had been installed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Led by Siad Barre.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. It [the military dictatorship] had embarked on a major flirtation
                    with the Soviet Union. In fact, by that time they were already on our enemies
                    list. In fact, I dare say that Somalia was one of the African countries which we
                    were on the worst terms with. So that had a certain amount of appeal. At that
                    point the “creeping coup d'etat” in Ethiopia that toppled the Emperor was
                    already well under way. In fact, Anne Read, my friend from INR [Bureau of
                    Intelligence Research], used to call me regularly and ask my opinion on the
                    significance of events going on there. I kind of “pooh-poohed” a lot of it.
                    There was a taxi strike in Addis Ababa which, in retrospect, turned out to be
                    the first shot fired in the revolution. She said, “This looks pretty serious.
                    All of the taxicabs are on strike.” I said, “Oh, that kind of thing goes on all
                    the time. It doesn't mean anything.” Well, it did mean something, and she caught
                    it pretty early.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>By May, 1974, it was clear that Ethiopia was on the skids. In August, 1974, I
                    went over to the desk. In September, 1974, the Emperor was trundled into the
                    back seat of a blue, Volkswagen “Beetle” and driven away into imprisonment and
                    ignominy. I embarked on what started out to be a year of absolutely gripping
                    desk work. Ethiopia was coming unglued, the Emperor was deposed, and he was
                    replaced by what turned out to be a Kerensky-like figure, General Aman, who was
                    of the class that we had been encouraging all along, a member of the educated,
                    enlightened bureaucracy. But it was too late. The revolution came too late for
                    people like this. I think that the analogy with the February and October [1917]
                    revolutions [in Russia] was quite suitable—quite apt. The initial figures who
                    took over were members of a moderate, enlightened, Westernized group. But they
                    were really just stalking horses for the young radicals [in the military] who
                    dispensed with them very quickly. In the case of Ethiopia over a period of three
                    or four months they shoved them aside and took full control of the government.
                    They got even more radical in the ensuing years.</p>
                <p>By December, [1974], it was pretty clear that we weren't dealing with a bunch of
                    reformers but had some really hard core, revolutionaries on our hands. At the
                    same time the Russians were moving more deeply into Somalia, with the base that
                    they had established at Berbera, in the northern part of Somalia along the Red
                    Sea coast. They put a major missile-handling facility there. They built a port
                    to service their Indian Ocean Fleet. They would bring naval missiles [into
                    Berbera] for refurbishing, refitting, and storage. The U. S. was getting really
                    agitated about this, particularly on the Hill [Congress]. A few, really
                    conservative Congressmen were calling for us to cut off relations with Ethiopia
                    and with Somalia.</p>
                <p>Satellite technology was just coming into its own. We were able to get very
                    detailed, satellite photos of these Russian installations in Berbera. The
                    Somalis were denying that any of this was going on, stating that this was just
                    an agricultural equipment depot in the middle of the desert. They invited the U.
                    S. to send a Congressional delegation to Somalia to inspect these facilities. It
                    reminded me a little bit of the British holding a referendum in Kenya—did they
                    really think that we were going to come over there and they were going to pull
                    the wool over our eyes? We sent a delegation, and the delegation found exactly
                    what it expected to find. The Somalis were furious. They said, “We invited you
                    over here, we gave you the full run of everything, and then you came back with
                    this outrageous report.” Our delegation said that it was only reporting what it
                    saw.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Relations with Somalia were very rough. There was a lot of dialogue back and
                    forth with the Embassy about what they were really up to—were they really
                    Russian stooges, were they really communists, or were the Somalis cynically
                    taking advantage of the Cold War to build up their arsenal and milk as much aid
                    as they could out of both sides? In many ways I think it was a classic example
                    of the differing perspectives between the post in the field and the policy
                    makers back in Washington. The people in the Embassy in Mogadishu were much more
                    relaxed about all of this. They said that the Somalis weren't communists. They
                    were just manipulating us and the Russians. They said that we should keep in
                    touch with them but not let them get us all bent out of shape. The military [in
                    Washington] were getting really agitated about the Soviet facilities [in
                    Somalia].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the period when Secretary of State Kissinger was
                        at the height of his influence. Kissinger saw everything in terms of the
                        Cold War and an international, bipolar system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Our dilemma was that we had put most of our eggs into the Ethiopian
                    basket for many, many years. Ethiopia was clearly coming unglued, and we didn't
                    really know what to do because, even though they had become very radical, they
                    kept coming to us and continuing to ask us for more military assistance, citing
                    the Russian buildup in Somalia. Kagnew Station was still in operation there [in
                    Ethiopia], and the [U. S.] military was still saying that it was important. The
                    Ethiopians were threatening to close it down unless we helped them, and the
                    Somalis were beginning to build up to what looked like some intention of
                    launching an offensive [against Ethiopia], taking advantage of the chaos in
                    Ethiopia. Even though the military regime had taken over in Addis Ababa, the
                    rebellion in Eritrea was getting really critical. That was the point at which
                    the [Ethiopian] request for assistance to fight off the Eritrean rebels in
                    Asmara was made. I think that by the end of 1975 it became clear that we were
                    just not going to be able to sustain it [an enhanced military assistance
                    program] with the Ethiopians.</p>
                <p>They would continue to try to get whatever they could out of us. But they, unlike
                    the Somalis, really were committed revolutionaries. Sooner or later, they were
                    going to boot us out of there [Kagnew Station]. I don't know. Things just sort
                    of spun out of control. We didn't feel that we had an option in Somalia because
                    the Russians were firmly ensconced there, while our base in Ethiopia was
                    eroding. At that point the Russians began to make inroads into Ethiopia, and it
                    looked as though they were going to take over the whole Horn of Africa. However,
                    they hadn't really reckoned on the aggressiveness of their Somali clients. The
                    Russians thought that they could hold this all together. They thought, in fact,
                    that they could impose a “Pax Sovietica” on the Horn of Africa, but the Somalis
                    weren't having any of that. They thought that the Ethiopians were really in a
                    very weakened condition. The Somalis took advantage of their Soviet support and
                    equipment to attack Ethiopia. At this point the Soviets, who were beginning to
                    make real inroads into Ethiopia, told the Somalis that they couldn't do that.
                    The Somalis replied, in effect, “Go to hell,” kicked the Soviets out of Somalia,
                    and invited the Americans in. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So in the space of three months there was an exchange of clients, and we took the
                    leftovers in Somalia, while the Russians moved into Ethiopia. That was after I
                    left the desk, though.</p>
                <p>We could end this segment by my recounting how, after a year on the job I was
                    approached by the then Special Assistant to the Director of INR...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 2, 1993. We're continuing the interview. You

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, I think I was telling you how, after a year on the job as desk
                    officer for Somalia and Ethiopia, I was approached by the Special Assistant to
                    the Director of INR, who, in fact, had been my predecessor in my job in Addis
                    Ababa, to see if I was interested in replacing him as Special Assistant to the
                    Director of INR, who was then William Hyland. I considered the maxim that one
                    should always seize opportunities for new experiences and professional
                    broadening. I had spent seven of my first nine years in the Foreign Service,
                    working on the Horn of Africa. I thought that I was well advised to seize the
                    opportunity, eventhough things were then beginning to get very interesting in
                    the Horn. So I accepted the offer. This was back before the days of “open
                    assignments,” when you basically got your job by personal connections.</p>
                <p>It was a truly interesting job, a one-year assignment. It was a one-year
                    assignment because the assumption was that people more or less “burned out”
                    after a year. This was a 12 or 14 hour a day job. You usually only had such jobs
                    for a year at a time. So I figured that I could try it for a year.</p>
                <p>I was only on the job for a couple of months when Hyland was called over to the
                    White House by [then Special Assistant to the President for National Security
                    Affairs] Kissinger to be Kissinger's “eyes and ears” [on the National Security
                    Council—NSC—staff] when Kissinger became Secretary of State or when he dropped
                    the NSC part of his dual-hatted role. I don't recall who became the Special
                    Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, but, in any case,
                    Kissinger wanted to make sure that he had control or at least very close
                    observation of what went on over there. As Hyland was one of Kissinger's
                    long-time disciples, he left INR and went over to the White House. Hyland was
                    replaced in INR by Hal Saunders, who had been a Deputy Assistant Secretary in
                    NEA and was appointed Director of INR, which was equivalent to an Assistant
                    Secretary of State position. That changed the nature of the job considerably for
                    me because Hyland was very much a Soviet and arms control specialist, while
                    Saunders was an NEA/Middle East hand, which was an area which I had long
                    followed from the outside because, up to that time, I had not worked in NEA.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In any case there were no other staff assistants, so I was the principal,
                    organizational link between the Director of INR and the rest of the Bureau and
                    essentially the staff level and the rest of the Department. It was an extremely
                    busy year. That was the year when Congress was investigating the intelligence
                    establishment, the year of the Church Commission in the Senate and the Otis Pike
                    Commission on the House of Representatives side. There were numerous, lengthy
                    reports being prepared on the intelligence community, and this, of course,
                    included INR. Saunders, as the chief intelligence officer in the Department of
                    State, was the “point” man for the Department in all of these hearings. This
                    involved going through massive numbers of documents and clearing them for the
                    committees to see and so forth. I also vetted all reports and analytical papers
                    which came in from the Bureau for the Director's clearance. He basically cleared
                    all but the most routine kind of papers. So it turned out to be a good, 14 hour
                    a day job but one that I found quite challenging and rewarding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were from outside [the intelligence community]
                        and you were looking at everything that came through. What is your
                        impression of the quality of the output from INR, the analyses, and policy
                        recommendations? Also, did you get any feel for how these things were used
                        in real life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: As you know, INR is not in the policy recommendation business, at least
                    theoretically. INR's mandate is to analyze intelligence from all sources,
                    including Foreign Service reporting and clandestine reports from CIA, and to
                    produce finished intelligence, primarily for the Secretary of State. I guess
                    that most INR reports don't go out of the Department. Intelligence which goes to
                    the White House usually comes from CIA. The State Department, through INR, sits
                    on the inter-agency bodies that produce National Intelligence Estimates. So
                    State's contribution to them is very important.</p>
                <p>I thought that the quality of the analysis was really quite mixed. I think it
                    varied a great deal, depending on the experience and quality of the analyst.
                    There were certain offices in INR that were staffed primarily by civil servants,
                    people who had been doing their particular work for many years and who really
                    did it very well. My sense is that the offices that tended to be more heavily
                    staffed by Foreign Service Officers, on the whole produced less consistently
                    good intelligence. This was not because Foreign Service Officers were less
                    capable but simply because they came out of a different kind of culture, and it
                    took them a while to adapt to the INR style.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I mentioned before, I had the INR desk for the Horn of
                        Africa from 1960 to 1961. I had never served there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>KULICK: That was a little unusual. I think that, by and large, they tried to
                    staff those offices with people who knew the various regions first hand, if they
                    are FSO's. But occasionally, a rule like that breaks down, I guess.</p>
                <p>As to how INR reports were used, I think that the variable there is the consumer
                    as much as the producer. I had no sense that Kissinger was terribly influenced
                    by what INR produced, although Saunders personally had a great deal of influence
                    on Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Saunders was a figure of some importance within the State
                        Department at various times. What was your impression of how he
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Calling him “low key” understates the matter considerably. He is
                    extremely low key, very modest, soft-spoken, and cautious. I think that he is
                    brilliant in his analytical capacities. However, later on in his career, I think
                    he tended to be a bit idealistic. To me, that is not a pejorative term, but
                    occasionally I thought that his idealism tended to color his judgments about
                    things. I wasn't so much aware of that tendency when he was Director of INR as
                    later on. He is a very broad thinker and likes to think in conceptual terms. I
                    think that's why Kissinger liked him. I honestly was so involved with and taken
                    up by the Middle East side of what he was doing that I don't recall focussing
                    very closely on the other kinds of things he did personally. For example, Cold
                    War analysis. However, I had the highest respect for his integrity and honesty
                    and for the clarity of his thinking, as well as the breadth of his vision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even with a very powerful Secretary of State did you get
                        the feeling that we had to tailor our reports to meet the Secretary's
                        outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, although that has certainly happened at various times. Paradoxically,
                    it may have happened more frequently with less powerful Secretaries of State. In
                    such cases people in INR and further down the chain may have thought that they
                    had more license to tailor analyses to their own policy directions because they
                    felt that the man at the top was more easily influenced or led. I say it is
                    paradoxical, because one might expect that when you're working for someone like
                    Kissinger, you'd be afraid to produce anything that didn't serve his policy
                    predilections. But in the case of Saunders, at least, I never had the feeling
                    that that was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left that job in INR—you were there for about a
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That was 1975 to 1976. What followed was the real turning point in my
                    career, at least. In the course of a year [in INR] I got to know people all over
                    the State Department and became much more aware of how the system worked and who
                    was doing what. I don't remember exactly how this came about, but I met a fellow
                    working on the Israel desk, named Mike Sternberg. I remembered very clearly
                    being struck that Sternberg was working on the Israel desk, because it had been
                    almost taken as a “given,” from the time that I entered the Foreign Service,
                    that Jews were not assigned to work on Middle Eastern affairs, and certainly not
                    on Israeli affairs. I remember saying to him that an assignment like his wasn't
                    supposed to happen. He said that he had been told the same thing but he just
                    decided to test the system and found that, in fact, there was no resistance to
                    such an assignment. No one ever spelled this out, but it would seem to me to
                    have something to do with the fact that you had a Secretary of State named Henry
                    Kissinger who, while hardly a card-carrying Zionist or a synagogue-going Jew,
                    certainly would have fit the category of people who hitherto had been supposedly
                    excluded from Middle East policy affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact Kissinger had been excluded from
                        Israeli affairs for a while during the Nixon administration, when he was
                        National Security Adviser. At least it's been said that he left it to
                        Secretary of State William Rogers to “play” with the Middle East while he
                        did everything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. That's interesting. That may have been his own decision. I confess
                    that I have not read Kissinger's memoirs. He may have addressed this question,
                    although, knowing his ego, he probably didn't. In any case, by 1975 any taboo
                    that may have existed previously was about to disappear, and Mike Sternberg was
                    more or less the first, entering wedge. There also was a Jewish political
                    officer serving in Tel Aviv at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was John L. Hirsch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: So I thought, if he can do it, I can do it. I went over and said that I
                    understood that there would be an opening on the desk. I speak Hebrew, I know
                    the region, I had been a student in Israel, and so forth. Again, this was before
                    the process of “open assignments” began. At that time, if you worked out a deal
                    with the office director, that was it. The Bureau said that it wanted me, and I
                    was assigned.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>That really was kind of a turning point in my career because all of this sort of
                    “pent up” desire to get involved in Likud issues was released. I had what I
                    found to be a very exciting assignment in the Office of Israel and Arab-Israel
                    Affairs (IAI). I dealt with human rights and settlements issues, as well as
                    United Nations affairs, all of which were really meaty questions. I did a great
                    deal of “outreach” work, you might say. I went out and did a lot of public
                    speaking. I spoke to a lot of Jewish groups, often quite hostile because the
                    State Department then—and I suppose even now—enjoys a very bad reputation in the
                    Jewish community, much of which, I think, is long outdated. However, it probably
                    goes back to the 1930's. The performance of the State Department in dealing with
                    the question of Jewish refugees, Hitler, and the subsequent prosecution of the
                    war is very well known and well documented. The allegations of anti-Semitism in
                    the State Department...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from a class that was basically anti-Semitic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's right. I think that subsequent writings and the release of records
                    and so forth have authenticated that. I was not aware of that when I first got
                    onto this speaking] circuit. I was puzzled by a continuing atmosphere of
                    suspicion and hostility that I found when I would go into a synagogue or a B'nai
                    B'rith meeting. Almost the first question someone would ask would be, “Are you
                    Jewish?” If I said, “Yes,” they'd say, “How can you work for an organization
                    like that?” I always thought that this view stemmed from a kind of knee-jerk
                    objection to anybody who would criticize Israel or take issue with Israel's
                    policies or in any way try to demonstrate a “balanced” approach to the Middle
                    East. I mean, the view of these Jewish community group's was], “If you're not
                    100% for Israel, you must be anti-Semitic.” There was an element of that, but it
                    was much more complicated than that. It really had much more to do with the
                    historical background]. It was at that point that I went back and started to do
                    some reading on the holocaust. I read a book called, “While Six Million Died,”
                    by Arthur Morse, which documents quite fully and persuasively the U. S. response
                    to the holocaust. There is quite a bit of material in there on that subject.
                    There are quotations from various memoranda prepared by people like Sumner
                    Welles [World War II Deputy Secretary of State] and Loy Henderson [later Under
                    secretary of State for Political Affairs]. I think that both of these
                    individuals [were concerned], but I don't want to libel anyone. I recall that
                    those were the two people who were mentioned. Also there was someone called
                    Summerfield, I think. I don't recall precisely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is almost a mental exercise I find myself going
                        through as a non-Jew, every time I come up against Israeli policy. I keep
                        going through a mental exercise, examining myself, asking whether I am
                        falling into anti-Semitism because I have real problems with the State of
                        Israel. I'm partly of German descent, but it doesn't mean a thing to me. I
                        don't have to go through an examination on how I look at Germany but with
                        Israel I go through this process. I believe that a lot of Foreign Service
                        Officers go through the same process. However, as a Jew, dealing with
                        Israel, did you have to go through some mental adjustments or were you
                        examining yourself to say, “Am I being too hard or too easy?” Was this a
                        part of your thought process?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, surprisingly not, because I had always been, not exactly on the
                    fringe—these terms are not terribly precise—but “on the Left” of the Zionist
                    [political] spectrum, let us say, with respect to Israel. That is, particularly
                    after 1967. Before 1967 there really wasn't much debate. But after 1967, when
                    the Occupied Territories became a very central and emotional kind of issue, I
                    had always been in that group which believed that it was not in Israel's
                    interest to occupy these territories on a permanent basis. I thought that
                    Israel, for its own sake, should go as far as possible, consistent with its
                    essential security requirements, to make accommodations and to seek a peace
                    agreement with the Arabs and the Palestinians. This was pretty much, I think,
                    the policy of the U. S. Government and of the State Department. Only very
                    rarely—in fact, almost never—do I recall the State Department taking a position
                    that I thought was truly threatening to or disadvantageous to Israel, in my
                    perception. That didn't mean that it didn't put us at odds with the Government
                    of Israel, even before the Likud Government came into office. However, it was a
                    policy that I felt comfortable with. I did not feel that it was jeopardizing
                    Israel's security and I surely did not feel [that U. S. policy] was the result
                    of any animus or bias against Israel. If anything, particularly during the
                    Reagan administration, I was critical of U. S. policy as being too lenient, too
                    accommodating, and too willing to take the Israeli point of view on subjects
                    like the settlements [in the Occupied Territories], the invasion of Lebanon, and
                    a variety of questions. Of course, in a highly political, highly effervescent
                    environment like that of Israel, no matter what your point of view, you can find
                    a significant body of people within Israeli society who share that view.</p>
                <p>To anyone who says that this represents an anti-Israeli point of view, you can
                    say, “Well, what about those 20 people in the Knesset whose views are precisely

                    there. They live there.” The point is that for me, personally, there was never
                    any problem like that.</p>

                <p>KULICK: Let me stop and just comment on your use of the word “disproportionate.”
                    I am assuming that you are not using that in any nefarious sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No! I'm just saying that there are ethnic groups—I'm
                        thinking [now] about the Greek community. I've dealt with Greek, Korean, and
                        Croatian groups. They have more influence on our political process, say,
                        than Turkish, Arab, or other groups.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I think that the point is that the influence is commensurate with the
                    degree of interest and concern on the part of the groups involved, rather than
                    any nefarious...</p>

                <p>KULICK: Well, that's true. This is an issue of very great importance. More so,
                    probably, than any other ethnic group, the Jewish community has more of a
                    commitment on this particular foreign policy issue with the possible exception
                    of the Serbs and the Croats—and perhaps the Irish. I'm sorry. What was your
                    question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very important for the State Department to be able to
                        explain its position to an influential political group, as it would be to
                        newspaper publishers or any other. You said you encountered a certain amount
                        of initial hostility [among some Jewish community groups] to the State
                        Department. How did you find the response [from these groups] over a period
                        of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I felt satisfied after talking to such groups if I could leave them
                    believing that, whatever differences may exist between their particular views
                    and those of the State Department and, therefore, of the U. S. Government, these
                    were based, not on any animus against Israel and not any latent anti-Semitism,
                    but on an honest disagreement stemming from different perspectives as to the
                    broader interests of the United States in the world. In other words, this was an
                    honest debate, discussion, or disagreement, if you will, stemming from the same
                    set of values but from a different perspective, rather than a question of
                    anti-Semites in the U. S. Government who were out to “get” Israel. Or, to put it
                    the other way round, from people subject to Arab influence who are only
                    concerned about currying favor with the Arabs because of their control of oil,
                    money, and other kinds of resources.</p>

                <p>If I could come away from a session like that and [have them] say, “Well, we

                    recognize that there is a basic commitment there to Israel's welfare and that
                    the United States will not pursue any policies” which, certainly by their
                    reckoning and any reasonably objective reckoning, are injurious or threatening
                    to Israel. The fact that I was Jewish, that I spoke Hebrew, that I had lived in
                    Israel, and that I came from the background that I did—undoubtedly contributed
                    to my credibility. Although, in [the view of] some audiences that kind of thing
                    triggers the “traitor” kind of [epithet].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Uncle Tom” or something like that. What were some of the
                        major issues [you faced during your time on the desk]? You were there from
                        when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: This was from mid-1976 to mid-1978. The issue of [Jewish] settlements [in
                    the Occupied Territories] was very “hot” then, even though the number of
                    settlements and the number of settlers was one-tenth of what [they are] now. The
                    U. S. still had not, if you will, reconciled itself to the inevitability of this
                    process as, I think, the Reagan administration, to its discredit, did—to its
                    great discredit it did. Every new settlement occasioned an announcement by the
                    State Department spokesman, articles in the newspapers, and a whole debate on
                    whether they were “legal” or not. The position of the State Department at that
                    point was still that the settlements were not only an obstacle to peace, which
                    was the point which was settled on by the Reagan administration, but that they
                    were “illegal” under international law. Of course, you can imagine that [that
                    position] gave many Jewish lawyers a field day. Although most don't [practice]
                    international law, there were several who prepared very trenchant and scholarly
                    legal defenses. This was an issue that was debated endlessly. As I say,
                    ultimately the Reagan administration withdrew from that position, either because
                    they felt it wasn't worth fighting for or because they had a Legal Adviser [in
                    the State Department] who had a different or more sympathetic view. That was one
                    issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Human rights questions were also very controversial. It was during that
                    period, under the Carter administration, that the State Department began issuing
                    annual human rights reports. I wrote the first report [on Israel].</p>

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Every word was parsed and every comma was examined. Long after all the
                    other reports were in, that one was still outstanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first human rights report was a seminal document. The
                        first one really had to be just right. What happened? This was at the
                        beginning of the Carter administration [1977]. [The report on] Israel was
                        the most controversial. Everybody would be looking at this one. Would we be
                        fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People would say, “Is this a real report?” Because it was
                        well known that Israel had problems. So the question asked was, “Is this
                        real or is this another one of these...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The process evolved with every [issue of the Human Rights Report]. At the
                    outset the real debate was over whether there were such things as “extenuating
                    circumstances” and to what degree should the report try to be subjective in
                    addressing such extenuating circumstances. The bias in the human rights
                    community, if you will, was very much against the use of extenuating
                    circumstances. They wanted, as much as humanly possible, all of these reports to
                    be based on essentially the same criteria and to reflect a uniform set of
                    analyses that would each stand on its own merits as a statement of the truth in
                    that particular country. [In their view] it was unacceptable to say, “They've
                    been bad, but the guys next door are even worse,” or, “Well, they may have been
                    bad, but when you consider that the previous regime was incomparably worse,
                    these guys look pretty good.”</p>
                <p>It was inevitable that those kinds of comparisons would influence the drafter.
                    However, the point was to try to keep the reports as “clean, uniform, and
                    objective” as possible. That can be done with relative dispassion if you're
                    talking about Lesotho or Burma or Australia. Nobody really cares very much
                    [about them]. But when you got to Israel, it mattered enormously, because,
                    first, Israel was by far the largest recipient of United States aid and military
                    assistance and political support out of all proportion to its strategic value or
                    any of the other criteria normally applied to these kinds of positions.
                    Secondly, most of that [aid and support] was based on the proposition that
                    Israel was a democracy, Israel was “like us” in an area very alien and very
                    hostile to our values. Therefore, Israel “deserved” all of this support, not
                    because American Jews had an emotional attachment [to Israel] but because,
                    objectively speaking, this was a country with which we had a great deal in
                    common and whose support and security were a vital security interest of the
                    United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Any report like this which undermined that proposition was clearly very
                    threatening. A report which said that the Israelis torture people, blow up
                    people's houses, and expel people without due process and so forth would be very
                    damaging. All of those things happened [in Israel], to one degree or another.
                    The question was how do you treat them? Do you minimize them, do you ignore
                    them, do you describe them with extenuating circumstances? Particularly at the
                    very beginning of this process it [required] an enormously delicate and
                    painstaking effort.</p>
                <p>The first drafts [of such reports] were generally produced [by the U. S. Embassy
                    in the country concerned]. But they were nothing more than a first draft. They
                    were not intended to be the final report, which was produced in the State
                    Department. The draft that came in from [the Embassy] went to the country desk,
                    I think, and perhaps also to the Bureau of Human Rights Affairs. Basically, it
                    was the desk and the Human Rights Bureau that produced the draft which everyone
                    else looked at. There was a big struggle between the Human Rights Bureau and the
                    various desks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who controlled that process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Obviously, the Human Rights Bureau would say, “Oh, the desks suffer from
                    clientitis. They're going to make these things come out 'right.' Only we have
                    the [necessary], lofty kind of objectivity.” The desks said, “Oh, the hell with
                    that. These are not just academic documents.” That was the nexus of the
                    struggle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Human Rights Bureau, a new
                        organization under a “true believer,” Pat Derian. Whom did you deal with and
                        how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: You know, it's funny. I don't remember [the names of] the individuals
                    involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They allowed you to “play” with the draft first, before it
                        [went any farther]? Perhaps the word “play” is the wrong one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, sure, we wrote a lot of it. They were right. The draft that came
                    from the Embassy did tend to tread too lightly on some of the less attractive
                    aspects of the subject. But the version prepared by the desk was still looked
                    upon by the Human Rights Bureau as far too indulgent, far too protective of the
                    “client.” This wasn't true just of Israel. This was true across the board, but
                    without question the draft [prepared by the desk] was the version most closely
                    looked at. When the report came out, the newspaper stories on the Human Rights
                    Report led with a comment like, “Israel's human rights practices criticized,”
                    or, “Torture alleged,” or something like that. That was the lead, even though
                    there were 140-odd reports in the document. Anyhow, it was a real education in
                    the interaction of domestic politics and foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel “heat” from the Assistant Secretaries of the
                        Near Eastern and Human Rights Bureaus? Were they sort of fighting above you
                        on this report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. The real, “heavy” combat did not take place at the desk level.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you could see the tracer bullets. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. That's a good metaphor. They would come back to us. We would be
                    told, “Rewrite this, rewrite that, or touch this up a little bit.” I think that,
                    ultimately, what came out was pretty good. It was truly a product of the clash
                    of ideas and perspectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it really set the pattern for later on, not only for
                        yours...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: One thing that I was responsible for was that the report that came back
                    from the Embassy treated Israel and the Occupied Territories as a unit. I said,
                    “The first thing you have to do is to split those apart, because there are two,
                    radically different sets of premises here. Within Israel proper [the
                    authorities] must be judged like any other country. Israel is a democracy, and
                    clearly there can be no distinctions as to how it treats its citizens. On the
                    other hand, the Occupied Territories are under military occupation, which, by
                    its very nature, is not democratic.” I said, “This inevitably involves human
                    rights practices which would not pass muster in a democratic society.”</p>
                <p>We were successful in introducing that distinction, which, I think, holds even
                    until now. The lead paragraph [of the Report] says that these are two different
                    situations. I haven't read the report for several years. It has waxed and waned
                    in its harshness, depending on the political climate between the U. S. and
                    Israel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were sitting on this very touchy issue, did you
                        find, at that time, a difference between the reporting from our Consulate
                        General in Jerusalem and that of the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Oh, very much so. [It took some doing to manage] that because, as you
                    know, the Consul General in Jerusalem does not report to the Ambassador [in Tel
                    Aviv]. That and, I guess, Hong Kong, are the only consulates general that report
                    directly to the Secretary of State. They are, to all intents and purposes,
                    embassies by another name, in terms of their relationships with Washington. Of
                    course, there was a constant struggle between the Consul General and the
                    Ambassador in Tel Aviv over that. The Embassy always tries to assert more
                    control or authority over the Consulate General. The Consulate General always
                    insists that it is an independent post, not hostile to the Embassy, obviously,
                    and desirous of a good, working relationship, but a post with a different
                    constituency, perspective, and chain of command.</p>
                <p>There were some zealots in the Consulate General. I would say they were
                    unabashedly pro-Palestinian. “Pro-Palestinian” doesn't necessarily mean
                    “anti-Israel,” but in the case of these two individuals I'm thinking of they
                    were both. Their reporting, of course, was a major factor in preparing the
                    [human rights] report on the Occupied Territories. Of course, the Embassy
                    weighed in very heavily on that, saying that you couldn't base the report on the
                    [situation in] the Occupied Territories just on the basis of the reporting from
                    the Consulate General in Jerusalem. The Embassy expressed—I think correctly—a
                    major voice in that process.</p>
                <p>There was one famous case of a young woman, a consular officer, Alexandra
                    Johnson...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She wound up on the front pages of the newspapers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. Someone “leaked” a cable, which had the very euphonic number of
                    “Jerusalem 1500” [Cable No. 1500 from the Consulate General in Jerusalem]. It
                    was a cable about torture in the Occupied Territories. It became a major piece
                    of “samizdat” in Palestinian circles. Everybody knew about it. In fact, she even
                    wound up writing a book called, “Jerusalem 1500.” She [later] left the Foreign
                    Service. I don't know whether she leaked [the telegram] herself or whether
                    somebody else leaked it. It became a very big stick which the “Israel bashers”
                    [used] to try to discredit...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any outside pressure—one, from the
                        “Israel bashers,” and, two, from AIPAC [America-Israel Public Affairs
                        Committee]? While the process was going on, particularly since this was the
                        first issue [of the Human Rights Report] and would be setting the mold, all
                        of the power groups on all sides must have been trying to weigh in to set
                        the pattern.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, but not at my level. This was going on well above my pay grade. This
                    would have been going on at the level of the Secretary of State or, certainly,
                    the Assistant Secretary [of the Near Eastern Bureau]. It would filter down, but
                    in general I very rarely got a note from anybody which I could attribute to
                    “muscle” [being exercised] by one side or the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about Israel's rule in the Occupied
                        Territories? This was during the period of the Likud Government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, [I had mixed feelings.] Prime Minister Begin came into office
                    midway through my tour on the Israel desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even so. Was there a change? How did you see this, looking
                        at this very controversial situation as a Foreign Service Officer? How did
                        you feel that the Israelis were dealing with Palestinian problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I was devastated by Begin's victory. Going back to what I was saying
                    before about my own, personal orientation on these issues, I regarded that as a
                    disaster. Some 15 years later I haven't changed my mind at all. I think it was a
                    disaster for Israel. I don't accept the notion, for example, that only Begin
                    could have returned the Sinai [Desert area to Egypt]. I think that that's
                    baloney, although that is the argument that people often make.</p>
                <p>Clearly, there was a change in policy. Rabin and the Labor Government did try to
                    “hold the line” on the settlements, although they allowed themselves to be
                    manipulated, intimidated, and kind of worn down by the Right wing in the
                    Occupied Territories in setting up these “guerrilla” settlements which were
                    subsequently “legitimized.” When Likud came into power, they blatantly reversed
                    the policy of the Labor Government, which was to have established settlements in
                    those portions of the Occupied Territories over which they felt, for security
                    reasons, Israel had to maintain long term control. Labor had avoided
                    establishing settlements in those areas which were thickly populated with Arabs.
                    Under the Labor plan these areas would be returned to Arab sovereignty. Labor
                    never accepted the idea that there would be a Palestinian state, but I think
                    that all along the notion was that the Jordanians would come back and take over
                    most of the land on the West Bank.</p>
                <p>The policy of the Likud Government was antithetical to that. It sought to ensure
                    that no segment of the Occupied Territories would [be without] Jewish
                    settlements. [This would] make it impossible to partition the area in any way
                    which would leave Jewish settlements out [of the consideration]. In other words,
                    they wanted to put Jewish settlements all over the Occupied Territories, so that
                    you would have a Bosnian type of situation. You couldn't partition the area
                    without having to move people and thereby stirring up so much emotion that it
                    would practically prevent it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're ready to start again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Let me start this phase by saying that [Prime Minister] Begin came to
                    power just about halfway through my [period of service] on the [Israeli] desk.
                    One of my duties during my assignment there was to help to prepare the new
                    Ambassador, Sam Lewis, for his assignment to Tel Aviv. I made many of his
                    arrangements. We got to be quite friendly, and just before he went out, he said
                    that he'd like to have me come out to serve in the Embassy [in Tel Aviv] as a
                    political officer. He was interested in building up the Hebrew-speaking
                    component of the Embassy. Up until that point it had consisted of only one or
                    two officers. I was thrilled at the idea, although I had a major struggle with
                    my wife over it. I eventually accepted the Ambassador's offer and spent my last
                    year [on the Israeli desk] getting ready to go out [to the Embassy in Tel
                    Aviv].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The fall of 1977, which also happened to be the time of [Egyptian
                    President Anwar] Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. This visit completely galvanized
                    and captivated the imagination of everybody involved in the peace process and
                    the Arab-Israeli issue. I said “peace process,” but this term had not yet been
                    invented. The Sadat visit really started the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impression did you have of Sadat at that time? What
                        was the word in the corridors [at the State Department] about Sadat and
                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, this man was a great visionary. Personally and single-handedly he
                    shattered a stalemate that had lasted almost 30 years. There was nothing but the
                    greatest of admiration for him. He was certainly an unorthodox kind of
                    character. I mean, it goes without saying that the president of the largest Arab
                    country who announces—and then promptly follows through on—a pledge to go to
                    Jerusalem is extremely unorthodox. I recall at least one Foreign Service Officer
                    grumbling about how he [Sadat] had “betrayed” the Arab cause. But there were
                    very few people in the Foreign Service who had that unbalanced a sympathy for
                    the Arab cause and saw [this development] in that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in [South] Korea at the time. It was thrilling to
                        feel that there might be some movement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KULICK: I remember the day that he [Sadat] made his statement. At first everyone
                    was convinced that it was some kind of trick, that he was engaged in some sort
                    of rhetorical flourish. However, the Israelis, to their credit, [accepted it at
                    face value]. Of course, later on it turned out that this was a kind of “put up
                    job.” It didn't come out of the blue. The Israelis had been talking with the
                    Egyptians behind the scenes for six months or so. The Egyptians had already
                    gotten certain commitments from the Israelis before Sadat made his announcement.
                    But nobody else in the world knew that, and it seemed like a “bolt out of the
                    blue.” However, the Israelis said, “Yes, sure. Come ahead.” At that time many
                    people expected Sadat to find some excuse or put up some condition, such as,
                    “Yes, I'll come, but...” or something like, “You'll have to commit yourselves to
                    withdrawing from the Occupied Territories.” But Sadat didn't do that. It was
                    just an incredibly thrilling four or five days. From that point on the whole
                    atmosphere changed completely, although it took nine months after that for the
                    Camp David Agreement to be reached, because it turned out that “one visit to
                    Jerusalem does not a peace agreement make.” All of the intervening meetings,
                    including the one at Leeds Castle [in England in 1978] simply could not [resolve
                    the outstanding issues]. Imagine what's going on now. They talk and they talk
                    and they talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Palestinian-Israeli...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, it was Egyptian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I'm talking about what's going on today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Right, the post-Madrid Conference talks. The Palestinians were not
                    involved in the [discussions that led up to the Camp David Agreement]. Just the
                    Egyptians and the Israelis. But President Carter decided that these
                    conversations were not going to [lead anywhere] unless he personally took
                    responsibility for them, put the prestige of the American Presidency on the
                    line, and took the enormous gamble of inviting Sadat and Begin to Camp David.
                    Carter basically decided that he would not let them leave until an agreement was
                    signed. I contended then and I continue to contend that Jimmy Carter is probably
                    the most under-appreciated President of this century. Hopefully, history will
                    rectify that view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Usually, it does.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, the “shade” of Harry Truman can attest to that. Without [such a
                    commitment from President Carter] the [Camp David Agreement] would not have been
                    reached. People forget that. After [the Agreement was signed], he still had a
                    make a trip to the Middle East himself and personally shuttle between Tel Aviv
                    and Cairo to [ensure] that the last few unresolved issues were settled. Anyhow,
                    the whole tenor of the office and the policy process shifted after that and
                    became much more focussed on the Sadat visit to Jerusalem to bring about a
                    breakthrough in the peace process.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, in March or April, 1978, the Israelis invaded Lebanon, and
                    everybody was terrified...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first incursion...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Operation “Litani.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't the one which [took the Israeli Army] all the
                        way to Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, no. I can't recall what was the immediate, precipitating cause [of
                    the 1978 incursion]. Probably, some terrorist incident. At the time it was
                    Israel's biggest incursion into Lebanon, but it only went up as far as the
                    Litani River.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Operation “Peace for Galilee” was in 1981 or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: 1982. I think, to the credit of the United States, that we came down very
                    hard on the Israelis [in 1978] and told them that this [kind of behavior] just
                    wasn't “on” and that they had to get out. We could see that the whole peace
                    process with Egypt was at stake. If we hadn't [taken the action that we did],
                    [this whole process] could well have fallen apart. It was against that backdrop
                    that I went off to Israel in the summer of 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last question, before we move to [your assignment to]
                        Israel, is what was the opinion of people who were dealing with [this
                        issue], like King Hussein of Jordan? For a long time it was considered, as
                        you mentioned before, that when push comes to shove, Jordan eventually might
                        take over the West Bank and be a controlling factor in the peace process.
                        How did we feel about him at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I think we pretty much felt about him the way we feel about him today. He
                    is, first and foremost, a “survivor.” Sometimes, I think, the man has more luck
                    than brains, when you consider all of the “bad” decisions that he's made over
                    the years. It's quite astonishing...</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That he's still around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: But he just celebrated his 40th anniversary on the throne [of Jordan]. We
                    looked on him as very useful, obviously, and extremely important to us. I think
                    that there were doubts about his statesmanship and about his popularity in his
                    own country.</p>
                <p>“Black September,” you may recall, took place in 1970, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember right now. I think that it was in the
                        early 1970's. We can add this later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: In any case he was always [considered to be] very shaky on the throne.
                    There was always the fear that the Palestinians were somehow going to “get” to
                    him. We were very much committed to keeping him around. I think that at that
                    point we probably agreed with the Israeli view—in fact, I know that we agreed
                    with the Israeli view—that the ultimate solution to the West Bank problem was
                    for Jordan to take control of [that area] again. Of course, at that point
                    [Jordan] had never renounced its claim to the West Bank. It was not until the
                    late 1980's that King Hussein finally washed his hands of the West Bank—at
                    least, legally speaking. So we saw him as the key to any Palestinian-Israeli
                    settlement, because we were completely opposed to any idea of an independent
                    Palestinian state. Yet, we were also opposed to the idea of perpetual, Israeli
                    rule [of the Occupied Territories]. The only alternative to those
                    [possibilities] was Jordanian control of the West Bank.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gil, we left you when you were [assigned] to the Political
                        Section [in the Embassy in Tel Aviv], where you served from 1978 to
                        1981.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation [in Israel] at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I went at a very dramatic time. I believe that I went [to Tel Aviv] in
                    August, 1978, which was a time of intense activity on the Arab-Israeli peace
                    front. You will recall that President Sadat [of Egypt] had gone to Jerusalem in
                    November, 1977, and made his famous and dramatic appeal to the Israeli people
                    for peace. I was then on the Israel-American desk. I guess that we talked about
                    that in an earlier part of this interview. I was on the desk when Sadat made his
                    visit. That, of course, redrew the whole political map in the Middle East with a
                    stroke, or certainly as far as the solid front against Israel which the Arabs
                    had maintained up to that point. From November, 1977, and for the next few
                    months there was a series of negotiations to try to convert President Sadat's
                    visit to Jerusalem into a permanent peace agreement between Egypt and Israel.
                    They had been “floundering,” I would say, trying to find a formula which could
                    bridge the gap.</p>
                <p>There had been meetings in England, the most intensive and extensive of which was
                    the meeting at Leeds Castle, I think, in April, May, or June, 1978. The
                    “breakthrough” still eluded them. It was in August, 1978, that President Carter
                    decided that it was going to require his personal intervention to break the
                    logjam. The elements were there. Sadat had made his trip, and the Israelis had
                    responded openly and warmly, but they were still too far apart to [reach
                    agreement]. So President Carter invited Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat
                    to Washington—to Camp David. I don't mean to go into all of the details of the
                    Camp David [negotiations]. I wasn't there, but everybody knows that it was the
                    real “watershed” in the history of the relations between Israel and its
                    neighbors.</p>
                <p>I was [serving in the Embassy] in Tel Aviv in September, 1978. I had just been
                    there about a month when the [Camp David] Agreement was signed. Of course, it
                    electrified [everyone in Israel]. The whole Camp David process had riveted the
                    attention of everyone in Israel. When the announcement was finally made that an
                    agreement had been reached, it was probably the most dramatic moment of my
                    career, in terms of the political environment in which I was working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that one's senses are sharpest when you first get
                        to a place. As you had come from the Israel Desk [in Washington], you were
                        already sensitized. What was your impression of the reaction [in Israel],
                        across the political spectrum, as far as the Camp David Agreement was
                        concerned? Were people pretty favorable [to it]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>KULICK: You will recall that the negotiation was entered into and was conducted
                    by a Right Wing government [in Israel]—by far the most conservative government
                    that Israel had ever had. If this same negotiation had been carried out by the
                    Labor Party, one could have expected massive opposition to it and, perhaps,
                    “blood in the streets” and so forth. The fact that the [negotiations] were
                    conducted by [Prime Minister] Begin and the Likud Party gave [the agreement] far
                    more legitimacy with the [political] Right [in Israel] than would have been
                    possible otherwise. You often hear the “Nixon to China” analogy used very
                    loosely. I don't “buy” that, but it was that sort of motif, which explains why
                    the Israeli Government was able to bring most of the people along. Certainly,
                    there was a very Far Right faction which was much opposed to the Agreement.
                    However, by and large, [the Agreement] was welcomed with open arms by the
                    Israelis, because, I think, Egypt and the occupied Egyptian territory in the
                    Sinai [Desert] played a very different role in the Israeli psyche than the
                    territory of Palestine proper, that is, the West Bank and Gaza. Prime Minister
                    Begin was able to reach an agreement which, in principle, and ultimately in
                    practice, provided for the complete return of [the Sinai Desert] without evoking
                    the kind of emotional response that we're now seeing in the negotiations with
                    the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also the Golan Heights weren't looking down on
                        [Israel].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The Golan Heights weren't involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so this was something that was, in a way, “out of
                        sight.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: There was no emotional attachment to the Sinai. It was purely a security
                    issue in the minds of all but a tiny handful of people in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What areas did you cover as a political officer, at least
                        to start with, and how did they develop? Then, how did you go about doing
                        your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I had several “portfolios.” One of them was the whole question of the
                    Occupied Territories, Israeli settlements and settlers, and human rights
                    practices in the West Bank and Gaza. I was the person in the Embassy who wrote
                    [the first draft of] the Human Rights Report. I visited the settlements and
                    reported on Israeli settlement activity and so forth. I also handled the whole
                    “international organization” account. So it was my responsibility to handle [all
                    of our contacts] with the Israelis regarding UN resolutions and the UN system
                    [as a whole]. As you know—at least it seemed to me at the time—most of the
                    political work we did in the UN, in one way or the other, always ended up with
                    Israel's position.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It always seemed to end up that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: So it occupied an inordinately disproportionate amount of time, relative
                    to the real significance of it. But we had to give it the time it demanded.</p>
                <p>Finally, because I spoke fluent Hebrew and had lived in Israel before, I backed
                    up the officer in the Political Section who dealt with Israeli domestic affairs.
                    This meant primarily covering the Knesset and so forth. I was clearly being
                    groomed to take over that position when he left, which I did, a year later, when
                    my “portfolio” changed. I still followed the settlements, but someone else
                    covered the UN, and I focussed almost exclusively on the domestic, political
                    scene. I probably drafted two or three telegrams a day. The debate on the peace
                    process occupied a fairly large part of my work, as well as Israeli reactions to
                    various bilateral issues, and so forth.</p>
                <p>When I went out to Tel Aviv, I don't think that my rank in the [Political
                    Section] was specified, beyond the fact that I was an O-1. Most of the people in
                    the Political Section were 0-1's and 0-2's. But about two months after I got
                    there, the Political Counselor called me in and said that he was very
                    dissatisfied with the person who had been designated as [his] deputy. He felt
                    that [this person] wasn't competent to do the job. He didn't draft well at all
                    and didn't have the contacts that I had. He said that he was going to designate
                    me as his deputy. That made me a little uncomfortable because this other guy had
                    come out [to Tel Aviv] with that assignment. He was, in fact, the Labor Attach�,
                    as well, and was an FSO [Foreign Service Officer]. But I said that I was
                    perfectly prepared to take on the job and I said that I hoped that [the
                    Political Counselor] could do this in a way that wouldn't “poison” my relations
                    with [the Labor Attach�]. The Political Counselor had no problem with that. He
                    was a very tough...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Political Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Bob Blackwill, a man reputed for his heavy hand in dealing with
                    colleagues. However, perhaps precisely because he was so tough-minded, I found
                    that I learned a great deal from him.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, the change was effected. The other guy, in effect, was demoted back down
                    to his regular position as a political officer, and I was named Deputy Political
                    Counselor. That was the role which I filled during [the rest] of the time I was
                    there [in the Embassy in Tel Aviv].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the human rights issue. We've
                        already talked about [how this issue was handled] in the Department. For
                        Israel, more than anything else, [this issue] is extremely important
                        politically. It's important domestically as well as in foreign [policy
                        terms].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was as sensitive as it was important.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, sensitive. Did you find that there was a
                        difference in reporting on [this issue] in Israel than when you were back in
                        Washington, putting together [the Israeli section of the annual Human Rights
                        Report]? You had the West Bank [issues], you had allegations of
                        mistreatment—maybe more than allegations...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Of torture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Torture, and the whole business. The Israeli Defense
                        Forces are not exactly a benevolent organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: But bear in mind that this was long before the “Intifada” [Palestinian
                    uprising]. For the first, I would say, 15 years of the occupation, the Israeli
                    occupation was, on the whole, a benign or a benevolent occupation. I accept the
                    view of those who say that that is [somewhat of a contradiction in terms],
                    because there is no such thing as a benign or benevolent occupation.
                    Nevertheless, one can make relative comparisons to other kinds of military
                    occupations. By those standards one would have to say that the Israeli
                    occupation was a “relatively” benign [occupation]. That is to say, it was
                    carried out with a minimum of brutality and a minimum of bloodshed. But having
                    said that, I found that there were a lot of distasteful aspects to Israeli
                    behavior [in the Occupied Territories].</p>
                <p>However, the first thing that we did, when I wrote the [Israeli section of the]
                    first Human Rights Report in 1976, was to divide the report into Israel itself
                    and the Occupied Territories, making it quite clear that different circumstances
                    obtained [in each area] and [that there was very] different behavior. Within
                    Israel proper the behavior [of the police and security forces] could stand up
                    pretty well against that of most Western democracies, although, given the kind
                    of “siege” circumstances under which they lived. Even within the “Green Line”
                    [Israel proper] there were practices to which we would not give a 100% bill of
                    health. There was [the practice of] detention without trial and that sort of
                    thing. They used coercive methods of interrogation, and so forth. But by and
                    large [their practices] would stand up against the records of most Western
                    political democracies.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>In the Occupied Territories there was obviously a different situation. Again, the
                    clear caveat at the beginning of all this is that a military occupation is not a
                    democratic situation. The responsibility of the military there is to maintain
                    their security. Within those [parameters] practices are—I don't wish to say
                    “sanctioned” or “approved”—but “recognized” as necessary which would not be
                    acceptable in a democratic kind of situation. The point that I always made was
                    that these practices—and, again, I'm choosing my words carefully—can be
                    “tolerated,” though I wouldn't say “sanctioned”—only if the occupation is a
                    temporary and transitional arrangement toward an evolution, at the end of which
                    the people there are accorded some form of self-determination. If the military
                    occupation, in fact, turns out to be a “permanent” state of affairs, then one
                    cannot make those kinds of rationalizations. It then becomes a dictatorship or a
                    tyrannical situation, rather than a less than perfect situation necessitated by
                    the need to bring about a transition to democracy.</p>
                <p>But the issue was controversial—within the Embassy and between the Embassy and
                    the Consulate General in Jerusalem. There was always a running battle...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk [a little more] about this? Part of what
                        we're trying to do is to show the dynamics of the foreign policy apparatus.
                        And this is one of the classic cases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Yes, it is. At its most fundamental level there was always a question of
                    “Who's in charge?” in Jerusalem. Under our legal definition of “jurisdiction”
                    applicable in the area, Jerusalem was not, formally speaking, part of Israel. It
                    was a contested area, whose status had not yet been finally determined. Our
                    Consul General in Jerusalem was not accredited to the Government of Israel, in
                    any formal sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>KULICK: When I was there [in Tel Aviv], there were two: Mike Newlin, who was
                    later replaced by Brandon Grove. In the “Foreign Service List” [the post is not
                    called] “Jerusalem, Israel.” It is simply “Jerusalem.” The consular stamp which
                    we placed on people's visas and passports says, “Jerusalem.” This is a matter of
                    great sensitivity with the Israelis. The more sophisticated Israelis recognize
                    this as a fact of life. Journalists were always bringing it up, and indignant
                    American Jews and indignant Israelis would, from time to time, make an issue of
                    this. But it was even controversial within the Department, in the sense that no
                    one challenged the formal distinction between Jerusalem and Israel. However,
                    there was naturally a [certain] level of tension between the Ambassador and the
                    Consul General. It was all handled in Foreign Service terms. No one formally
                    challenged the jurisdiction [of the Consulate General], but the Consulate
                    General regarded itself—and no one would have ever acknowledged this—as a sort
                    of “proto-Embassy” or “crypto-Embassy” to Palestine. Or at least certain
                    individuals within the Consulate General [so regarded it]. I wouldn't say that
                    that necessarily applied to the Consul General.</p>
                <p>The Consul General had a very difficult job because he had to be on good terms
                    with both [Israeli and Palestinian] communities. Everything he might do to
                    ingratiate himself with one community—automatically and in a Newtonian kind of
                    balance—would alienate the other guys. If he didn't get along with the Israelis,
                    his life was going to be unpleasant. So we had two [office] buildings—one in
                    East and one in West Jerusalem. We had two Christmas parties—one in East and one
                    in West Jerusalem. The Consul General's residence and the main office building,
                    if you will, were in West Jerusalem. But the Israelis consistently and always
                    talked about the American Consulate in East Jerusalem as a way of driving home
                    [their view] that we “tilted” toward the Palestinians.</p>
                <p>You asked about human rights. This dichotomy was very clear in the way that human
                    rights developments were reported. [One officer in] the Consulate General who
                    was there when I was [in the Embassy in Tel Aviv] ended up by resigning from the
                    Foreign Service and publishing a book about Israeli human rights practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Her name was Alexandra Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember. She was on the front page of the newspapers at
                        one point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. She wrote a book called, “Jerusalem 1500,” which happened to be the
                    number of a telegram which she had drafted, a [cable which denounced] torture in
                    Israeli prisons in the Occupied Territories. The cable was “leaked,” and there
                    was a huge “to do” about it. [In my personal view] she wasn't suited to the
                    Foreign Service. She had clearly became very partisan and emotional on this
                    issue.</p>
                <p>However, when the Embassy reported on this issue, [it tended to be] from the
                    perspective of the Embassy's “client,” the Government of Israel. Well, any
                    Foreign Service Officer will understand the situation automatically. [The
                    Consulate General in] Jerusalem was reporting from the point of view of its
                    “clients,” the Palestinians. So this kind of thing went on all the time—on
                    settlement activity, and so on. Whenever there was any question, the Consulate
                    General would always [tend to] “tilt” on the side of exaggerating or
                    highlighting the more damning version of the story as to what was going on at
                    any particular time or place.</p>
                <p>This [situation] also affected relationships between individual [Foreign Service
                    Officers]. My counterpart in Jerusalem and I used to have a lot of arguments
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether there was ever any effort made to
                        “get together” and have lunch, because of what was almost built-in
                        antagonism. [This kind of situation] sometimes happens between our Embassies
                        in India [and] Pakistan. But here you were so close together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, [we saw] each other practically every day. It might be interesting
                    [to discuss this further] for the purposes of this interview. The Embassy, of
                    course, was in Tel Aviv. But as [the Israelis] didn't recognize it [Tel Aviv] as
                    the capital [of Israel], [virtually] all of our [Embassy] business was carried
                    out in Jerusalem. Sometimes, the Ambassador would literally make 10 trips a week
                    [to Jerusalem]. He once said that he made three trips up and back between
                    Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in one day. The Ambassador's chauffeur [could drive along
                    the road] almost in his sleep. He could make the trip in about 50 minutes. An
                    average driver might take one hour and 10 minutes. But the Ambassador did a lot
                    of his business in the car. He would dictate cables on his way back from
                    Jerusalem. I was probably up in Jerusalem three or four times a week, for
                    example], going to the Knesset or Parliament, which was my principal “beat.”</p>
                <p>It was a funny kind of “split” existence that we lived. [The Embassy] had a suite
                    of rooms at the King David Hotel [in West Jerusalem to accommodate Embassy
                    people] who were up there [in Jerusalem] late at night and didn't want to go
                    back [to Tel Aviv]. We saw our colleagues [in the Consulate General] a fair
                    amount. I would say that the relations on a personal level were really quite
                    good. I mean that none of us took [this problem] so personally that it really
                    interfered [with our duties]. However, on a professional level [it was
                    different].</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When a cable would go out from [the Consulate General in]
                        Jerusalem, presenting, you might say, “the dark side of the moon” regarding
                        action on settlements or something like that, would you feel constrained [to
                        comment in another cable] or would the Ambassador say, “Here, we've got to
                        get [our view on record]?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It happened. Again, [you are putting it in] very stark terms. [We] didn't
                    have sharp confrontations. One point on which [the Consulate General in]
                    Jerusalem always stood very firmly was that they were not required to “clear”
                    their reporting with the Embassy. On the other hand, a certain amount of
                    discretion was required. When the [Consulate General in Jerusalem was] preparing
                    a report to which they thought the Embassy might take exception, we'd get a
                    “back channel” copy for comment. There was a pretty high degree of cooperation
                    on these things. Obviously, the Consulate General would like to avoid a
                    situation where they would send something in, and the Embassy would come back
                    with a rocket which would say, “No, this is nonsense.” Occasionally, the
                    differences couldn't be negotiated out, and you'd have these two different
                    versions. But, on the whole, it was all solved in a diplomatic kind of way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were both working with the thought that this could
                        end up in the press very quickly, through leaks and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, not usually, but it occasionally happened, as in the case of [the
                    telegram known as] “Jerusalem 1500.” In this case the officer in question had
                    become so emotionally embroiled in all of this that, I think, she arranged to
                    [get its text] into the press. But I think that most people were pretty
                    professional about it.</p>
                <p>I remember that on one occasion there was a visit by a Congressional Delegation.
                    The Ambassador went up to Jerusalem to brief them. It was sort of a joint
                    Consulate General-Embassy briefing. This may have happened more than once—I
                    don't know. There was a younger officer at the Consulate General—not the woman
                    in question, but another person—who challenged the Ambassador. The Ambassador
                    said something to these Congressmen about something that was going on in the
                    Occupied Territories on the West Bank. This [Consulate General] officer stood up
                    and said, “No, that's not right, Mr. Ambassador.” This guy was almost on the
                    next plane out of town, but he managed to [resolve this] problem. I don't know
                    whether this was just personal indiscretion or a surfeit of zeal or what. That
                    was unusual. Usually, these things were kept within the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the Israeli side? Here you were, reporting on
                        sensitive issues. Did you find that the Israelis were making an effort to
                        “get to you” and make sure that “their” side [was heard]? If something
                        happened on the West Bank which was brought to the attention of our
                        Consulate General there, would some [Israeli] come and “work” on you and
                        say, “Hey, this isn't really what happened” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>KULICK: We were rarely dealing with specific episodes or incidents. It was not a
                    situation where there was a massacre or a big “shoot out” or something like
                    that, and [the Israelis] would come and say, “Those guys shot first.” It was
                    much more a collective kind of reporting—on the general situation, rather than a
                    specific incident. However, the Israelis in the Foreign Ministry, the Prime
                    Minister's Office, and other places monitored very closely at least what came
                    out in public in the U. S. They would go out of their way to correct the record,
                    as they saw it, if necessary. I don't want to distort the picture. This was not
                    the sole or even the primary focus of our [contacts] with the Israeli
                    Government. What we've been talking about was my “beat.” But we had eight
                    political officers in an Embassy to a country of three million people. We had
                    the same size Political Section that we had in Moscow or Tokyo. So you can
                    imagine that there were very, very few aspects of Israeli political life that
                    were not the subject of American Embassy interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in Italy, I used to think that at times we got
                        too involved in political life there [and] that American interests, in
                        reality, [were not fully considered]. You can step back, as it were, and
                        wonder where, for example, the Israeli ship of state is going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: We had no problem in maintaining perspective between the particular and
                    the general. Sam Lewis was an outstanding Ambassador. He is a genius and a
                    first-rate diplomat, in my opinion. He never lost sight, for a second, of where
                    things were going. He certainly was the most effective Ambassador that I ever
                    dealt with. I would guess that there were very few members of our profession as
                    effective as he was in doing what he was sent out to do—though not always in a
                    manner that pleased everybody. There were a lot of people who thought that he
                    was much too close to [Prime Minister] Begin and too close to the Israelis. I
                    thought that myself, sometimes, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I
                    think that, whatever slightly excessive intimacy or excessive sympathy there may
                    have been, it gave him an influence and an access that was absolutely
                    unparalleled. That is, assuming that you use this access judiciously and when
                    you really need it. Access counts for nothing if all it does is ingratiate you
                    [with the government] and make you reluctant to come down hard when you have
                    to.</p>
                <p>[Ambassador Lewis] was a major player on the Israeli political scene. He used to
                    be called the “Pro-Consul.” He had a number of nicknames like that. He was a
                    major figure on the social scene in Israel, too. A social event was not complete
                    without Sam and Sally Lewis. He was preceded [in Tel Aviv] by Ambassador Malcolm
                    Toon, for example, who was a disaster. I don't know if you know Toon. He was a
                    very confrontational, very pugnacious sort. He thought that his job out there
                    was to tell the Israelis how to suck eggs. They were having none of this at all.
                    As a result, he may have gone to bed at night, thinking that he had stood up for
                    America and told [the Israelis] where to get off, but as an Ambassador, he was
                    useless. Lewis didn't pound his chest or pound the table, but neither did he
                    simply roll over and act like a lap dog.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told by people who served in Tel Aviv that it is sort
                        of a unique experience because you almost get “consumed.” The political and
                        social life is so active. Everything is an argument, but of a fascinating
                        nature. You are intellectually engaged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No question about that. People would ask me, “What's it like to be [in
                    Israel]?” I'd say, “Never a dull moment.” They'd say, “Great,” and I'd say, “No.
                    I'd like a dull moment once in a while. I was there three years and I never had
                    a dull moment.” You need a dull moment. The pace is absolutely relentless.
                    Again, I was there during the period between the Camp David Agreement, on the
                    one end, and the evacuation of the Sinai on the other. This [period] was
                    probably the most intense three years in Israeli political history. I suspect
                    that during the “deep freeze” period, say, between about 1983, when the treaty
                    was negotiated and the autonomy negotiations fizzled out, and about a year ago,
                    when Rabin came in [as Prime Minister], the pace was probably somewhat more
                    moderate. However, I doubt that it ever calmed down to what it would be like in
                    a typical, European capital. You know, it's not for everybody, but I thrived on
                    it. I must say that I had a particular, personal vocation for all of this. I'd
                    lived in Israel as a student, I'd studied at the Hebrew University, I speak
                    Hebrew, and I've had an intense involvement with Israel and with the whole
                    Zionist enterprise since I was a kid. But at no point did it ever, I think,
                    obscure my judgment about where U. S. interests lay, because my view of what
                    needed to be done in Israel was virtually indistinguishable from the view of the
                    U. S. Government. Therefore, I felt that I was doing the Lord's work by pushing
                    the Israelis in the direction that they needed to go. Of course, a very large
                    percentage of the Israeli people felt exactly the same way.</p>
                <p>I used to be asked all the time, “What's it like, being a Jew in the [American]
                    Embassy in Israel? Isn't it hard? Don't you find yourself torn by a conflict of
                    interest, an emotional [tension]?” No, absolutely not, not for a minute. The
                    only difficult part of it was watching the Israelis trying to figure out who I
                    was and where I was coming from. But that was more amusing than troublesome,
                    because I speak fluent Hebrew and I was intimately familiar with the situation
                    and the players. I clearly was not dispassionate on the subject but I always had
                    my eye on my mission as a Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was any effort ever made to...”Compromise” is the wrong
                        way to say it. Perhaps “co-opt” is the right word?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>KULICK: Never. I was quite astonished, in fact. I picked up comments from various
                    people, way over on the [Israeli] Right, who would refer to “house Jews” and
                    that kind of stuff. You know, when Secretary of State Kissinger went out [to
                    Israel], he got a lot of abuse from the [Israeli] Far Right. Someone held up a
                    sign at the airport which said, “Jew Boy, Go Home.” This was really vicious,
                    defamatory kind of stuff. No, I think that people [in Israel] understood,
                    however much they might disagree with my position on the issues. They knew where
                    I was coming from. I think that, all in all, [being a Jew] was a tremendous
                    asset for me.</p>
                <p>I'm pretty sure that I referred to this in the previous segment of this
                    interview, when I described how I happened to be assigned to the Israel desk [in
                    the State Department]. But I described that several months ago and I don't
                    recall exactly how I put it. At that time, when I went to talk about the job [on
                    the Israel desk], it was against the tradition of 30 years. There was [a
                    certain] “understanding” that [American] Jews were not assigned to Israel or
                    even to work on Israeli affairs. I mentioned that that [tradition] was broken,
                    as in the case of Kissinger's service as Secretary of State. In fact, Ambassador
                    Sam Lewis viewed the presence of people who knew the language and were familiar
                    with the country as a tremendous asset. In the eight-person Political Section in
                    which I served at one time seven of the eight were Jews—or, at least, six
                    persons plus one other whose wife was Jewish. Only the Political Counselor [was
                    not Jewish]. In the case of Charles Hill he might as well [have been Jewish] in
                    terms of his sentiments.</p>
                <p>I found that, notwithstanding the puzzlement which my role there elicited, on the
                    whole I was able to “break the ice” and establish relationships with Israelis
                    that would have been hard for anyone else to do. I think that I had far more
                    personal connections than anybody else in the Embassy, except for the
                    Ambassador, who almost literally knew everybody in the country well. They were
                    all his close, personal friends. I think that, in many ways, he thought of them
                    that way. He was an extraordinary person.</p>
                <p>In any case, in response to your question, there were absolutely no efforts made
                    to “co-opt” me. I don't think that anybody [in Israel] really felt that that
                    would be necessary. They didn't see me as an enemy, even though, as I say, I had
                    a lot of very acrimonious arguments with Israelis, particularly [those] on the
                    Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this [situation happens] quite often in other
                        places where we've talked [about a similar situation]. For example, there
                        are the Greek-Americans. For the professionals in the [Foreign Service] it's
                        not a big issue. They're serving in a [given] country where they have [close
                        family connections or ties of sympathy]. They know where their allegiance
                        and interests lie. What often happens is that you have people who come out
                        as “politicians” or people who are “super Greek” or “super Jewish” or
                        something like that back in the United States. They come either for a very
                        short time as political appointees or just as visitors and have a harder
                        time seeing this. There are other countries like this. We are all
                        “hyphenated” Americans.</hi>

                <p>KULICK: We have had Greek-American Ambassadors to Greece. We've never had a
                    Jewish Ambassador to Israel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure that this has worked very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I know that we had Ambassador Sotirhos who, according to people who
                    worked for him, was very, very effective, though they couldn't stand him. He was
                    a real son of a bitch in dealing with his staff but apparently he got along
                    famously with the Greeks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about visiting delegations? The normal visiting
                        delegation will come with a certain amount of history and “baggage,”
                        particularly in the case of a country like Israel—sort of with “stars in
                        their eyes.” They might resent somebody at the Embassy saying, “Yes, but
                        it's not quite that way” or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I didn't have much personal experience with things like that. Mercifully,
                    I was spared dealing with visiting delegations. In fact, the best thing about my
                    job was that I dealt exclusively with Israelis. I didn't deal with the
                    Diplomatic Corps, I didn't deal with CODEL's [Congressional Delegations, and] I
                    had relatively few dealings with other [U. S. Government] agencies there. I
                    spent my time with Israelis. During a typical work day I didn't get out of the
                    Embassy as much as I would have liked to, because the work load was so heavy. I
                    used to spend most of my time in the Embassy—about 12 hours a day. We would
                    routinely work 65 hour weeks. But nobody could find time [to do all that he
                    wanted] because it was so absorbing and so exhilarating.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Well, to their credit, they loved being there [in Israel] so much, too,
                    that they didn't mind my not being around. If [the Embassy in Tel Aviv] had been
                    a place where having Dad at home was the only break from a day full of drudgery,
                    boredom, or conflict with the surroundings, it would have been different. But
                    I'd routinely leave home at 7:30 AM and get home at 7:30-8:00 PM, and work on
                    Saturdays until 3:00-4:00 PM. Rarely did I get any flack. I could never have
                    gotten away with that in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going now to your focus on the Knesset and [Israeli]
                        personalities, how did we look at the Likud Party and particularly Begin,
                        Sharon, and other figures—at least during your time there? What was your
                        view of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>KULICK: It was clear that these people weren't our “friends.” It was clear to me.
                    Ambassador Lewis always maintained a very statesmanlike neutrality. He never
                    revealed his [feelings] on anything having to do with the Israeli Government. To
                    this day I don't know what he thought of Menachem Begin. I'm sure he didn't like
                    Arik Sharon—nobody could deal with that guy, without feeling [at least some]
                    distaste for [him]. However, I would say that in my reporting I let [my
                    feelings] “hang out” a bit more than most people did. However, I was not
                    assigned there to indulge my tastes or ideology. I was there to report on what's
                    going on, to analyze it, and to tell Washington what we ought to be doing about
                    it. I would love to have served [in Israel] when there was a Labor Party
                    Government in power, because, by contrast with the Likud Party, it must have
                    felt like “hog heaven.” On the other hand, no doubt, when you got down to
                    specifics, before 1977 I'm sure that the Embassy found itself in a situation
                    involving some [conflict]. Dealing with Israelis will always be that way because
                    they will always push you as far as they can. Even your friends will try to push
                    you beyond where you want to go. In a sense it's a little easier dealing with
                    less friendly guys because you feel fewer conflicts about drawing the line.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time at the Knesset. I had a pass to the Members' Dining room. I
                    was one of only about 10 non-Israelis who had a standing pass. I could go in any
                    time. I'd spend hours there, just gossiping and talking with guys—picking their
                    brains. A lot of them saw me as a conduit to the Ambassador—at least the ones
                    who didn't talk directly to him. If they had a direct tie to the Ambassador,
                    they weren't interested in talking to me. But that involved [only] a few people
                    at the top. I dealt primarily with “echelon one and a half,” I guess. Q: How did
                    this work out? You had this contact with a very active Parliament. However, in a
                    practical sense, what did this mean as far as your reporting went? Were you just
                    informing [the Department] or did it mean that you were trying to get something
                    done?</p>
                <p>KULICK: I spent a lot of time just arguing with these guys, trying to tell them
                    what our policy was and what it wasn't, and why we took the positions that we
                    did. This did not involve a conflict between Israel and the United States. With
                    some people that's an exercise in utter futility. You can't convince someone who
                    thinks that the United States is out to “do Israel in”—to destroy [the country]
                    by stages—that you have anything in common. But for people who are a little more
                    dispassionate, who can recognize that there may be tactical disagreements here
                    within a general, strategic convergence of view, a conversation like that can be
                    a lot of fun. You make some points. At the end of the day you may feel that you
                    have enlightened people, perhaps opened their minds a bit, gotten them to think
                    a little further about their positions. I wouldn't exaggerate this. It was not
                    my principal role or that of anybody else in the Embassy. We were not there to
                    “convert” Israelis. We were there, I think, in large measure, to make sure that
                    they at least understand what our position was.</p>
                <p>That's a big job. Views get distorted in the press and by people who don't like
                    us and who exaggerate [these matters] to make them even more unpalatable. But it
                    was a lot of fun, because these are great people.</p>

                        fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was a political officer's dream. I know that when you serve in places
                    like the former communist world, you spend all of your time, grasping for the
                    most meager crumbs of information. You read “Pravda” and try to figure out why
                    the comma is here [instead of there]. In Israel you were just inundated with
                    information. You cannot possibly absorb all of it. There are six daily
                    newspapers which you have to go through. If you don't speak Hebrew, you rely on
                    the translation. I'm afraid that my reading knowledge of Hebrew was not so good
                    that I could sit down and read all the newspapers. We had a three-person
                    translation staff in the Political Section which did nothing but translate
                    articles. I supervised them, [in addition to] my other duties.</p>
                <p>There are three million [Israelis] whom you can talk to. And they'll all talk to
                    you. They're all more than eager to get their views across [to you]. So there's
                    no problem whatever about getting information. The problem is sorting it out and
                    making sense out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major issues that you were trying to get
                        across during this three-year period that you were there [in Israel]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: The peace process was obviously the focal point of our whole
                    relationship. Equally obviously, we were in it up to our necks. As I was the
                    “point” person for domestic political [activities], I spent a great deal of time
                    explaining why we advocated what we did and trying to get through some of the
                    nuances of [this issue]. For example, explaining why we took the position we did
                    on settlements and why we considered them an obstacle to peace. I wouldn't think
                    that that would require a lot of explanation, but if your definition of “peace”
                    is getting the Palestinians simply to roll over and accept permanent [Israeli]
                    occupation, obviously, [our position] doesn't fit in with that conception.</p>
                <p>We also tried to interpret what was going on in the Arab world. I didn't deal
                    with that so much. That wasn't really my “beat,” but I'd pick up a lot [of
                    information] in the sense of the real intentions of the Syrians and Egyptians
                    and why [the situation] is not as bad as [our contacts] seemed to think. Without
                    sharing intelligence with them from Embassy reporting and elsewhere, you can
                    pass on an awful lot of information that will fill in gaps in their
                    understanding of what's going on in the Arab world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the Israeli media and the politicians
                        well-informed about what really was happening? Did they have—I won't say
                        “objective,” because that's the wrong term. But did they have a relatively
                        realistic idea of the dynamics of, say, Syria, Egypt, [and other Arab
                        states]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>KULICK: There was a significant body of Israelis who were quite expert on the
                    Arab world. They included scholars and journalists who read Arabic, who can
                    listen to broadcasts in Arabic, and who can easily read [these statements with
                    or without] translation. They have a relatively sophisticated understanding. But
                    there were very few Israelis who knew this [situation] from the [point of view]
                    of “understanding the enemy.” And if that's your point of view, you have a
                    built-in distortion. It's kind of like the Hobble [satellite] telescope. If you
                    shave the mirror too thin, it's going to throw the focus off. Obviously, [these
                    Arab countries] were their enemies, but not genetically programed to be so, not
                    implacably so, and ultimately people that they were going to have to deal with.
                    So you had to “break through” that that preconception [that the Arabs were]
                    people implacably opposed to their existence. You can understand the dynamic,
                    but you may believe that their current plan is to destroy you, rather than that
                    they need to reach some kind of reconciliation with you. I'm no expert on the
                    Arab world and that wasn't one of my principal concerns. But, inevitably, I
                    wound up spending a lot of time talking about things like that.</p>
                <p>We haven't really talked about internal [Israeli politics], which is what I
                    really concentrated on. I wasn't there to argue with them or tell them [what to
                    do]. I was there to understand what was going on within the Israeli political
                    structure, which was as fascinating as any internal political process that I can
                    imagine. [Israel] had a full spectrum in its representative parliament that ran
                    from communists to [people who were] practically neo-fascists. Perhaps “fascist”
                    isn't really the right word, but they were an extremely hard-line, conservative
                    faction that advocated, for example, the expulsion of all of the Arabs from the
                    Occupied Territories. They were a fringe, just as the communists were a fringe.
                    In the middle you had divisions along religious versus secular lines and,
                    obviously, Arab versus Jew. And you also had splits within Israeli Jewry, not
                    only between religious and non-religious but between Sephardis, people of North
                    African and Middle Eastern origins, and Ashkenazis, people of European
                    origins.</p>
                <p>There was a very significant split, not so much on the major political issues but
                    on domestic, social [matters] concerning the division of the “pie” and so forth.
                    The Likud Party played that very effectively and really came to power, not so
                    much because of its advocacy of a “hard line” toward the Arabs, but because it
                    was able to convince a significant portion of the Sephardic, lower working class
                    that they were being “screwed” by the European, Ashkenazi, oligarchic, upper
                    class [Jews]. There were many efforts to manipulate class consciousness and
                    ethnic [awareness]. It was a significant element in Israeli political life. It
                    had nothing to do with attitudes toward the peace process. The tendency among
                    diplomats and foreigners is to see everything from that point of view, because
                    that was so important to us. Among other things, what I tried to do was to point
                    out that there were a lot of other things going on which had nothing to do with
                    the peace process. They had to do with how economic benefits are distributed,
                    how the economy was organized, and the resentment of secular against religious
                    [Jews] who played a disproportionately powerful role in political life because
                    of the way the system is structured.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The [Israeli] Parliament was [elected under a process of] proportional
                    representation. You needed only one percent [of the votes] to obtain
                    representation in Parliament, so there were 15 [political] parties there at any
                    given time. [As a result, there were] razor thin coalitions which were always
                    dependent on the votes of these small, usually religious parties. They were
                    essentially “for sale,” usually to the highest bidder—the [coalition] that gave
                    the religious [parties] the most influence over domestic life and the most money
                    to run their institutions. They were very corrupt. It was a very corrupt
                    system—not so much personally corrupt but institutionally corrupt. These were
                    all things that were important for Washington to understand—how decisions are
                    made there [in Israel]</p>

                        religious parties, or were they a little more difficult [to approach]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: They were more difficult because they weren't interested in a lot of the
                    issues that we were interested in. The issues [in which they were concerned]
                    were far more parochial. They had a few, fairly sophisticated spokesmen. Well,
                    they all played the “Knesset game” very well, but not in terms that related
                    particularly to what was on our agenda regarding Israel. They didn't, by and
                    large, care that much about the peace process. They'd go along with whichever
                    party made them the best offer. Until 1977 that was “the Left,” the Labor Party.
                    After 1977, when the Likud emerged as the largest single party, the “line” of
                    the religious parties moved sharply to the Right. That is not to say that that
                    was the only reason. There has been a steady, Rightward drift in Israeli
                    national life since the beginning [of the independence of Israel] in 1948. The
                    parties that today are considered “centrist” were considered “Far Right” 50
                    years ago. The parties that are now on the “Left” were considered “centrist”
                    parties way back then, when the “Left”...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time [they sought] sort of a socialist utopia. How
                        did you find that the Israeli Government worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: A would-be socialist utopia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it as an American, how did the [Israeli]
                        Government work? How did they “deliver the goods” when you were there as far
                        as social programs—food and all the things...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>KULICK: You start off with the fact that Israel had a parliamentary, rather than
                    a presidential system, so that the whole process by which decisions are made and
                    goods are distributed is quite different from our system. I think that much more
                    of [this process] went on in Parliament than would be the case here in the
                    United States. The government, in any parliamentary system, is an extension of
                    the majority party or coalition in the Parliament. And politics are much more
                    personal than they are here, in dealing with a country of 3.5 million people. So
                    you need to know the personal histories of a lot of these people to understand
                    their relationships with other members of the government. Menachem Begin's aunt
                    was [Arik] Sharon's “wet nurse,” or something like that. There's not a whole lot
                    of intermarriage in the sense you have in a dynastic monarchy. However, it was
                    important to know the personal histories of these people. It took a lot of time
                    to get to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left [Israel] and just moved over a little to the
                        South? You left [Tel Aviv] in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No. I came back to Washington. [Tel Aviv] was my last overseas post [in
                    the Foreign Service].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought that you went out to the Sinai.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No. I went to the unit [in the State Department] here in Washington that
                    was setting up the multinational observer force, established [under the]
                    Israel-Egypt peace treaty. This was a multinational [operation] outside the UN
                    system because the UN, of course, completely rejected the Camp David Agreement
                    and would not or could not provide a peacekeeping force. However, one of the
                    conditions that the Israelis insisted on was that there be a kind of
                    multinational force out there in the Sinai to monitor Egyptian activities and
                    serve as a “trip wire.” So the U. S. took it on itself to organize such a force,
                    which we did. I volunteered to serve in the group that was putting this force
                    together, frankly because I hoped to stay in Israel—an option which I had failed
                    to exercise at the time that I should have and which I could have done, at the
                    end of my second year [in Tel Aviv].</p>
                <p>But at that point my wife was very eager to get back to the United States. We
                    weren't too happy with our son's schooling. However, by the end of the third
                    year [in Tel Aviv] we had changed our minds. But it was really too late to stay
                    on in my Embassy position. I saw this Sinai possibility as a way of staying
                    there. Anyhow, I did get involved in that group, but all of the work was done
                    back here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that time is moving on. This is almost a
                        parenthesis to [your assignment to] the Italian desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>KULICK: I was [on the Sinai planning group] for close to a year. I should say,
                    just to put the cap on the Israeli segment of my career, that in the summer of
                    1982 I went back out to the Embassy [in Tel Aviv] for about four weeks on TDY
                    [temporary duty]. Again, this was my wife's idea. [She said], why not offer
                    myself to the Embassy as a utility person?. The war in Lebanon had broken out. I
                    knew that the Embassy [in Tel Aviv] would be “stretched,” with transitions
                    between assignments and so forth. So I prevailed on Ambassador Sam Lewis to
                    bring me out there. The Embassy gave me an [airline] ticket. I found my own
                    housing. I “house sat” for somebody who was on R&amp;R [Rest and Recreation]. I
                    spent a month at the Embassy, reporting on Lebanon, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impact did [your period of TDY at the Embassy in Tel
                        Aviv] have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: You mean, [because I came back]?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not that. I'm talking about dealing with [the war in
                        Lebanon] during the time you were there [on TDY]. What was the feeling in
                        our Embassy [in Tel Aviv] regarding this movement into Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Very negative. That was one of the points that came out. However,
                    ironically, a lot of people believed—myself included—that the only reason that
                    the Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982 was because they got “a wink and a nod”
                    from [then Secretary of State] Al Haig. He has consistently denied this, and
                    it's not written down anywhere. However, I have no doubt that they [the
                    Israelis] looked at Haig and considered what he had to say and concluded that
                    they could do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had an interview with [Ambassador] Nick Veliotes, who
                        said that they weren't sure—I mean, that NEA [the Bureau of Near Eastern
                        Affairs]—wasn't sure [about Haig's role]. They [got in touch with then
                        Israeli Defense Minister] Sharon and said, “Well, now, listen here.”
                        [Veliotes] wasn't sure what Haig had said to him [Sharon] and tried to
                        persuade Sharon that we were not receptive to that type of action [the
                        Israeli move into Lebanon]. Of course, if you're somebody like Sharon, you
                        hear what you want to hear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that Haig had probably, as one military man to
                        another, sort of said, “Well, I can understand...”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>KULICK: Yes. I'm not saying that I'm certain that Haig did this with the full
                    cognizance [of President Reagan], but I have no doubt that Sharon, at least,
                    interpreted Haig—and I personally think that he interpreted him correctly—as
                    saying, “Boy, you've got a real mess there. Somebody's got to clean it up.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, anyway, this was not a glorious time for the
                        Embassy [in Tel Aviv].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, it was a period of great tension between Israel and the United
                    States. Well, you know, they [the Israeli Defense Forces] were at the gates of
                    Beirut. I guess that we probably came down on them as hard, at that point, as we
                    had at any time since 1976, when we forced them out of Sinai. However,
                    Ambassador Sam Lewis had the standing and the access and the trust to be able to
                    handle that without any great [damage] to [Israeli-American] relations.</p>
                <p>The Italian desk was something that I sought out. I love Italy and thought that
                    this would lead to an [Italian] assignment, hopefully in Rome. The Country
                    Director said that they'd been looking for someone who spoke Italian. I said,
                    “Look, this assignment that I'm in now is winding up early. I have 10 weeks or
                    so [in hand]. I'll go to the FSI and study Italian.” The Country Director said,
                    “Oh, what can you do in 10 weeks?” I replied, “Look, trust me. I can learn
                    Italian in 10 weeks.” And I tested at the 3 [Speaking] and 3 [Reading] level
                    after 10 weeks. Unfortunately, I've lost most of my Italian [since then]. What
                    you learn at that pace doesn't stay with you, unless you really use it. And I
                    haven't had much opportunity to use it.</p>
                <p>However, I went onto the Italian desk and then immediately said, “Hey, Ambassador
                    Sam Lewis wants me to come out to Tel Aviv.” The [Italian desk] wasn't too happy
                    about that, but I said that it was kind of a prior arrangement. Anyway, I came
                    back and really enjoyed what I was doing on the Italian desk.</p>
                <p>However, one day I got a telephone call from Charley Hill, asking me to come up
                    and talk to him about something the Secretary wanted me to do, or what he told
                    me that the Secretary wanted me to do: be a speech writer. I said, “I don't
                    really think so.” He said, in effect, “This is an offer that you can't refuse.”
                    What particularly struck me about that “offer” was that I had been offered the
                    same job when William D. Rogers was Secretary of State some years before, when I
                    had come back from my first assignment in Ethiopia. I'd resisted [the
                    assignment] then and turned it down, because I was working on environmental
                    affairs, something that I really was very much interested in. I was a little
                    afraid of taking on a speech writing job. This time, the second time around, my
                    wife said to me, “Look, you don't really want to run away from this. It's a
                    challenge, but you ought to take it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>So, although I had no desire to leave the Office of Western European Affairs, I
                    took the job. It was the biggest mistake that I made in my entire career. I
                    should have listened to my inner voice, because it was not the right assignment
                    for me. I proved [to myself] what I had suspected all along: I just don't fit
                    into that kind of isolated, intellectual environment. I'm really an “operator”
                    and not just a “thinker.” I need to be out there making things happen. They
                    liked what I wrote, and it was well received. However, it was absolute hell for
                    me for two years. And Secretary Shultz is a very difficult person to work for,
                    because he's a Sphinx: he never tells you what he wants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's sort of a stone face.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: He'd say, “Write me a speech on [nuclear] non-proliferation.” I'd say,
                    “Well, what about it?” And he'd say, “Send me [a draft] and I'll tell you if
                    this is what I want.”</p>
                <p>I learned a lot but I did not enjoy it at all. In fact, at one point I went to
                    the Director of Policy Planning and I said, “Please, let me get out of this
                    job.” And he said, “Well, if you can find another job, go ahead.” So, actually,
                    I found myself a job in H...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: H is the Bureau of Congressional Relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: In the Middle Eastern job there. I thought that this was going to be a
                    lot of fun. But then I was told that when Congress was in session, I'd better
                    forget about seeing my family. I'd be there until midnight every night. I took
                    [that news] home with me. [Laughter] You asked the question earlier. That was an
                    extremely difficult scene. So I kind of tucked my tail between my legs and went
                    back and said, “On second thought, this isn't something that I want to do.” I
                    should have said to all concerned, “However much this may discomfort you, I
                    can't go back to speech writing.” But I did go back and did it for another year.
                    And I survived.</p>
                <p>I'm proud of what I wrote. I wrote speeches on subjects that I knew nothing
                    whatever about when I started out. But by the time I finished, I had a fair
                    amount of knowledge about things like non-proliferation and even on economics,
                    about which I'm a total ignoramus. But I can string words together reasonably
                    well. I had very little contact with Secretary Shultz. I only saw him, face to
                    face, about five times during this whole period. Peter Rodman, who was Director
                    of Policy Planning, was, in fact, chief speech writer [for the Secretary],
                    although it didn't appear in the title on the door [of his office]. In fact, he
                    had the last word on speeches. A few, minor things were pretty much completely
                    mine, but on the really big speeches Peter had a major impact. I did that for
                    two years, finishing up in February, 1985.</p>
                <p>For the first time in my career I found myself without an onward assignment,
                    midway between assignment cycles. So I went to the Board of Examiners, which is
                    a traditional kind of perch...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a parking place but it's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did it for a year and enjoyed it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I went in there, thinking that it would be a year or a year and a
                    quarter. I made one field trip out to Atlanta where we [administered] all of the
                    exams for three or four weeks.</p>
                <p>Then I found out about a job in IO, [the Bureau of] International Organization
                    Affairs, in UN Political Affairs [UNP]. The position of Deputy Director [of UNP]
                    was open there. That appealed to me a great deal. I'd always been interested in
                    UN affairs. I think that this was still before the period of “open assignments.”
                    I went down and talked to the Office Director. He said, “Do you want the job?” I
                    said, “Sure.” I [took over the] job in April, 1985, as one of two deputy
                    directors in a 12-person office. I covered Africa, Latin America (about which I
                    knew nothing), the Middle East, peacekeeping, and multilateral arms control.
                    [The latter] was a complete waste of time. There were meaningful discussions
                    going on in the bilateral U. S.-Soviet context, but there are various,
                    miscellaneous things that the UN putters around with in the field of arms
                    control, frankly just to give some countries...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I guess that the chemical weapons treaty was the one multilateral treaty
                    that attracted some real attention in the United Nations.</p>
                <p>But that was a lot of fun. I enjoyed that. I got involved in peacekeeping issues
                    concerning the Golan Heights, in Cyprus, and then, of course, in Lebanon in
                    connection with the UN Force in Lebanon. The Lebanon [question] really involved
                    the domestic politics of [that country], trying to persuade Congress that this
                    was something that we needed to do. [We also had a hassle with the people in
                    [the U. S. Mission to the UN] in New York about what our assessment was and what
                    their terms of reference were, rules of engagement, and all that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The project there which I most enjoyed, on which I had the most personal
                    autonomy, was the effort to get the United Nations to open the war crimes
                    archive, which had lain moldering untouched in a warehouse somewhere in Long
                    Island for 40 years. No one had even known about it. There were literally
                    millions of documents which [the UN] had inherited from the [international]
                    tribunal which had conducted the Nuremberg trials. After the Nuremberg trials
                    were over, the records were all turned over to the UN. Well, there was the
                    Berlin Documentation Center, which had...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, [the Berlin Documentation Center] took over the
                        Nazi records...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: And the UN took over the Nuremberg Tribunal records. Then, somehow, just
                    by accident, somebody stumbled on these things. Stories had begun to come out
                    about [Kurt] Waldheim [Austrian Foreign Minister, then UN Secretary General, and
                    then President of Austria] and his activities during World War II. The searchers
                    had stumbled onto these archives and found vast, untapped resources that had
                    never [been looked at]. They were supposedly there for law enforcement purposes,
                    but nobody was pursuing war criminals at that point. Anyhow, a clamor arose
                    about the fact that these documents were there, but nobody had access to them.
                    There was a lot of pressure from Congress. Naturally, some Congressmen wanted to
                    hold up our UN contribution—in other words, to make it a hostage to [someone's]
                    private agenda. Together with USUN [United States Mission to the United Nations]
                    I negotiated a system whereby these documents, for all intents and purposes,
                    were opened to the public. They were [theoretically] limited to law enforcement
                    agencies, legitimate scholars, universities, and so forth, but the categories
                    were broad enough to cover anybody. Basically, you had to get a “permission
                    slip” from USUN. And USUN was told that, unless the applicant comes in
                    representing some scandal sheet, they should err on the side of generosity [in
                    issuing these slips].</p>
                <p>I enjoyed doing that. I frankly don't know what has resulted from it. The
                    concerns that were expressed were that these [documents] would be misused. There
                    is a lot of mistaken, raw, unevaluated intelligence in [those files]—including
                    unsubstantiated allegations made against people. Anybody [whose name is
                    mentioned in those files] is open to abuse, their lives could be ruined, and
                    their reputations could be besmirched because of some possibly bogus information
                    [in them]. I haven't heard that that has happened but I haven't heard that
                    anything has happened [at all]. Maybe people were more concerned about
                    establishing the principle [of access] than they were actually to do anything
                    with [the documents].</p>
                <p>I have seen that the Office of Special Investigations of the Department of
                    Justice actually has used those files, but I haven't heard about any improper
                    use of them. However, after the Damjanjuk fiasco no one should necessarily take
                    that for granted.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>We could talk a lot about the UN, but I should say that this was a period of a
                    real ebb in our relations with the United Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask whether the Reagan administration,
                        particularly at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It was the depths of our antipathetic relations with the United Nations.
                    [Jeane] Kirkpatrick [former U. S. Ambassador to the UN] was a died in the wool
                    UN hater, however she may have clothed her rhetoric. I think that, finally, they
                    [the Reagan administration] were just out to discredit the United Nations That
                    is not to say that there were not a lot of things going on there which cast
                    discredit on the United Nations. The UN had been allowed to sink into a pit of
                    what we would now call “international political correctness” and [become] a
                    cesspool of anti-Western, anti-Israeli [attitudes], bordering on the
                    anti-Semitic. [The UN] needed a good shaking up. If the Reagan administration
                    went too far in the other direction, who knows, in the long sweep of history
                    that [may have been] an inevitable reaction toward some kind of synthesis. I
                    don't know. I found it very distasteful. What was so ironic was that everyone I
                    worked with below the political level felt exactly the same way. It was kind of
                    a case of the “professionals” against the “politicos” in an almost classical
                    kind of way.</p>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary [in IO] was Alan Keys, a very provocatively Right wing
                    kind of character—very articulate and extremely bright but, I think, a kind of
                    malign character because he used all of this demagogy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't he fairly young? I heard people [comment about him]
                        when he first came in. He gave long lectures, almost monologues, and
                        harangues. People were saying, “My God!” He didn't convince anybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: No, he really didn't. I suspect that he didn't mind. I had the feeling
                    that he would rather hear the sound of his own voice than almost anything else.
                    He had been one of Kirkpatrick's deputies in New York. At that point, of course,
                    it was New York against Washington and a more or less constant attack against
                    the bureaucracy. When Keys came down [to Washington], [Vernon] “Dick” Walters
                    was assigned to New York as Ambassador. He was a much more low key, “good old
                    boy.” Things were suddenly turned around, and it was Washington backing New York
                    all the way.</p>

                <p>KULICK: Yes, IO/UNP [Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Office of UN

                        of the time and then Dick Walters was there for part of the time. I'm not
                        sure of the transition point. I worked with Walters when I was in the Office
                        of Southern African Affairs.</hi>

                        Southern Africa. What was your impression—and perhaps that of the people

                        which, I suppose, you could describe as “Right wing”? I'm not sure that that
                        is quite accurate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: As you know, she was a so-called “Jackson Democrat” when she started
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring to “Scoop” Jackson, Democratic Senator
                        from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: That's right. In other words, she was [among those people] whose basic
                    orientation was anti-communist. They regarded themselves as sort of “muscular
                    Democrats” on foreign policy. The reason that they were Democrats was that, on
                    the whole, they tended to have a fairly liberal, domestic orientation, a social
                    democratic, domestic orientation, but were very “hawkish” on foreign policy. You
                    know, [this faction] was started by a lot of people like Irving Kristol and
                    Norman Podhoretz. Frankly, my explanation was always that their spokesmen were
                    always heavily Jewish, with a Zionist background. I think that they came [to
                    this position] out of a recognition that strong support for Israel required a
                    very vigorous, assertive American foreign policy. Yet they had come from
                    socialist backgrounds, with strong social democratic values. So you got this
                    kind of blend of liberal, domestic views, and quite conservative, international
                    views. Gradually, their domestic views shifted over to accommodate their
                    international views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a group they've probably been in greater proximity to
                        the communists, as far as fighting them on the ground is concerned. Often
                        the social democratic group is the most anti-communist, because they had
                        been in the trenches, fighting them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>KULICK: Right, but that didn't reflect itself in a conservative, social agenda,
                    at least initially. They more or less held on to their social democratic values
                    but coupled them with a strong, forward-leaning, anti-communist [stance].
                    “Scoop” Jackson didn't come out of that background at all but he exemplified the
                    combination of values that they subscribed to. They sort of coalesced around
                    him. Gradually, they more or less shed their old, Democratic skin and reemerged
                    as Republicans. Jeane Kirkpatrick didn't join the Republican Party until three
                    or four years after Reagan came into office or even [later than that]. It was
                    regarded as a great event when she came to terms with the fact that she really
                    wasn't a Democrat any more. Of course, the explanation was always, “We didn't
                    abandon the Democrats. The Democrats abandoned us.”</p>
                <p>However, as far as attitudes toward her and those like her are concerned, I think
                    that, in general, there was a fairly clear split along political/career lines.
                    By and large the career people had little sympathy for that philosophy. You know
                    the views which I have expressed [previously in this interview]. I think that
                    Foreign Service Officers, by and large, tend to have a liberal world view simply
                    because they live in the real world and understand that it's far more complex
                    than the kind of [simplistic attitudes] which, I think, conservatives like to
                    hide behind. But that's obviously a very personal bias.</p>
                <p>As far as the view of Kirkpatrick was concerned, the Bureau [of International
                    Organization Affairs] was fairly well staffed with political appointees, because
                    they were relied upon to reflect that point of view. But there always was a
                    certain tension between them and the career people who, I think, had a more
                    appreciative view of the potential of the UN. Not “mushy headed” and not “One
                    World” [in outlook] but recognizing that we couldn't do everything ourselves and
                    that we needed the UN as a forum for talking with people whom we really couldn't
                    talk to in any other context. Anyhow, that's my view.</p>
                <p>Speaking personally, I think that her [Jeane Kirkpatrick's] ultimate agenda was
                    to discredit the United Nations because, I think, she personally regarded it
                    somehow as a tool of the Soviets and fundamentally opposed to U. S. interests.
                    Certainly, she was tied in with this whole group of neo-conservatives. I hadn't
                    used that term before, but that was the umbrella under which they all operated.
                    I think that the patently hostile attitude of most of UN members and UN
                    decisions toward Israel very definitely influenced that point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Israel was always under fire in the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>KULICK: You know, [these neo-conservatives] were right. The UN was very hostile
                    to Israel, but [in my view] that's no reason to abolish the United Nations. It's
                    a reason to stick with it and, over time, I think, [to improve it]. It would be
                    interesting to hear from her how she looks back on that time. She will probably
                    take credit for having “reformed” the United Nations, or at least “purged it” of
                    a lot of radical, “Third World” kind of excesses which it indulged in. In fact,
                    I think that neither she nor anyone else had anything to do with that at all.
                    [Rather], it had to do with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the general
                    corruption of that whole system which imploded of its own weight.</p>
                <p>Having said that, I do think that it was important for us to draw some lines in
                    the UN and make it clear that, however much we believed in the institution, we
                    could not continue to support the kinds of rhetorical excesses that went on
                    there, as well as the management excesses which turned one [UN] agency after
                    another into instruments of the “Third World” ideological agenda. I haven't
                    reached a balanced view [on this matter] myself. Of late I've become quite
                    involved in the Bosnian question. I'm extremely pleased to see that Kirkpatrick
                    has taken a very vigorous stand on that issue. I would not necessarily have
                    predicted this from her posture when she was Ambassador to the UN or even
                    necessarily from her other views on foreign policy. All of this is kind of
                    academic, because I had no personal dealings with her, anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering. Was it the feeling in IO that she
                        was effective or not effective, as far as the policy at that time [was

                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Oh, I think that she was quite effective in implementing the policy that
                    she was given to carry out. Sure. No, I don't think that there's any question
                    about that. The debate was over the policy itself and not whether she was an
                    effective spokesperson and advocate for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the USUN staff looked at IO—or at least
                        the Foreign Service contingent within it—as almost “the enemy”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: At USUN?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>KULICK: Well, USUN was staffed with Foreign Service Officers also. You had this
                    dichotomy both in New York as well as in Washington. Now, USUN in New York was
                    run by the Ambassador, and she used the Mission largely to promote her own
                    agenda, but there were certainly people in the Mission who were not 100%
                    sympathetic with her. They would commiserate with those of us in Washington who
                    felt the same way. Also, Kirkpatrick, during the early part of her tenure [at
                    USUN] had a very weak counterpart in Washington, Greg Newell [Assistant
                    Secretary for International Organization Affairs], who was quite ineffectual.
                    And I think that that was by design. I think that when she took the job in New
                    York, she made sure that her counterpart in IO was somebody who would give her
                    no trouble. And that certainly was what she got.</p>
                <p>Then, when she left [USUN], Alan Keys, who was her deputy, came to Washington and
                    effectively shifted the whole locus of that ideological juggernaut from New York
                    to Washington. She was replaced in New York by Ambassador Vernon Walters, who
                    was no ideologue by any means. So the whole ideological intensity shifted to
                    Washington. Previously, [USUN in] New York kind of “drove” the policy. When Alan
                    Keys came down here, Washington “drove” the policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to the Office of Southern African
                        Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I moved to [the position of] Deputy Director in the Office of Southern
                    African Affairs in the summer of 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Southern Africa include?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Southern Africa is everything South of the border between Tanzania and
                    Mozambique. It goes right across the continent. So it includes Mozambique;
                    Angola; the three former countries of the British Central African Federation,
                    Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi; South Africa; Namibia; and the three small, former
                    British colonies of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland—10 countries
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your principal concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: There were two Deputy Directors in the office: myself and, at first,
                    Larry Napper. The Director was Gib Landford. I had the “Southern Tier”—basically
                    South Africa, the “BLS” countries [Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland], and
                    Namibia. Larry had the “Northern Tier”—the two former Portuguese colonies
                    [Mozambique and Angola] and the three former countries of the British Central
                    African Federation [Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Malawi].</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>This was a pretty logical division because he [Larry] was concerned with the war
                    in Angola, which was by far the principal preoccupation of the “Northern Tier,”
                    and, to a lesser extent, the war in Mozambique. Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi
                    caused few problems but were closely tied in with what was going on in Angola
                    and Mozambique. I dealt with South Africa, Namibia, and the three “BLS”
                    countries.</p>
                <p>Our principal concerns were overwhelmingly dominated by South Africa itself, not
                    surprisingly. The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (the CAAA) had been enacted
                    in 1986, the year before I was assigned to the Office of Southern African
                    Affairs. This [legislation] mandated a comprehensive [group of] sanctions
                    against South Africa. Our office was responsible for seeing to it that [the
                    sanctions] were implemented, although that responsibility was divided between
                    us, the Department of Commerce, and the Treasury Department also. We had the
                    political responsibility for ensuring [compliance]. For example, our office
                    issued an annual report on compliance with sanctions and specifically how
                    American companies were complying with the requirements of the Comprehensive
                    Anti-Apartheid Act in terms of ensuring equal employment opportunity, job
                    training, resistance to apartheid in the work place, and all of that sort of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>We also dealt with many American companies which were trying to decide whether
                    they should stay [in South Africa] or withdraw. In other words, what were the
                    trade opportunities, what were the political considerations, and so forth?</p>
                <p>Of course, South Africa was engaged in a pretty aggressive campaign to
                    destabilize its neighbors. So we were constantly “locking horns” with them over
                    raids into Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and so forth, as well as the excesses of
                    apartheid within South Africa itself and the human rights dimension of all that.
                    I [joined the office] just before the turning point, when it began to become
                    clear that things were going to change in South Africa. Unfortunately, I wasn't
                    there for the election when De Klerk came to power. That [occurred] a few months
                    after I left. However, it was pretty clear that they [the South African whites
                    saw] the handwriting on the wall and [understood] that apartheid was doomed [to
                    be considered] as nothing more than a [worn-out] system for the oppression of
                    blacks. It was now going to be formally abolished or so heavily revised that it
                    would no longer be apartheid. I don't think that any of us were quite visionary
                    enough—I wasn't, at least—to believe that six months after I left the office
                    Nelson Mandela would be released from prison and that, four years later, there
                    would be an all-races election and a new constitution. The old South Africa
                    would be gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>But it was clear that it was heading that way. Sanctions were really starting to
                    bite. I personally had real doubts about the efficacy of sanctions. I had done a
                    kind of 180 degree turn on that question a year or so before, because I made a
                    false comparison, based on my experience in Israel, having seen how Israelis
                    reacted when put under that kind of pressure. There was the concept of a
                    “laager” mentality. My assumption was that the Afrikaners, or white South
                    Africans in general, would react that way—perhaps even more so. In the case of
                    Israel, what was being demanded of them was not to go out of existence but to
                    take chances with their definition of security and to abandon a certain,
                    grandiose vision of their territorial and historical destiny. What the white
                    South Africans were being asked to do was, in effect, to give up their whole
                    social and political structure. The demand was that they accept majority rule
                    and, in effect, live as a minority. My assumption was that they would never do
                    that under external pressure, under the pressure of sanctions. [I felt that] the
                    pressure would only drive them deeper into the “laager” and that the only way
                    that things were going to change would be for rising prosperity somehow to erode
                    the structures of apartheid. It was clear that, structurally, that system was
                    not workable, if [South African whites] wanted to maintain a high standard of
                    living and [to have] continuing economic growth.</p>
                <p>Well, I think that I was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point [the Bureau of] African Affairs was being
                        run by whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: By Chester A. Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.
                    He held that position throughout the entire eight years of the Reagan
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a continuing policy of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: “Constructive engagement.” The term was coined in an article that he
                    wrote for “Foreign Affairs” in 1980. It was basically the article that got him
                    his job. I think that the term “constructive engagement” is a very accurate and
                    descriptive term for his philosophy, which was that, essentially, disengaging
                    from South Africa via sanctions and other routes would not [be successful]. This
                    was the view which I was describing earlier inthe interview. Disengaging from
                    South Africa would not change the situation. This could only be changed by
                    embracing [the country] and, in effect, “flooding” it with American investment
                    and business, albeit with a requirement that these American business firms
                    exemplify and embody American principles and so forth, [on the assumption] that,
                    both by example and by virtue of increasing prosperity, change in South Africa
                    would be brought about.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>During most of this period Crocker's agenda involved getting a settlement in
                    Namibia. This is something which, he believed, could be done. He didn't think
                    that we could “abolish” apartheid in our time—or his time, anyway. But he did
                    think—ultimately correctly—that South Africa could be induced to withdraw from
                    Namibia and that Namibia could be brought to independence, in accordance with
                    the UN resolution passed in 1975. In effect, this resolution terminated South
                    Africa's legal right to be in Namibia and mandated that Namibia should become
                    independent, effective immediately. The philosophy [underlying this UN
                    resolution] was that you have to work with the South Africans. They're there
                    primarily for security reasons—or, at least, that is an argument which they make
                    and which has some validity, particularly when Angola, to the North, was full of
                    Cubans and Russians. [Crocker's] approach was that by getting the Cubans to pull
                    out of Angola we could then demand that the South Africans pull out of Namibia—a
                    symmetrical kind of arrangement, whereby Namibia would become a neutral “buffer”
                    between two, non-hostile states. His view had been that, were South Africa to
                    withdraw from Namibia while the Cubans, in effect, were running Angola, the
                    Cubans would then overrun Namibia, and the South Africans would wake up having
                    an outpost of the Soviet Union on their northern border. That is an
                    oversimplification, but that was essentially his view.</p>
                <p>So [Crocker] devoted most of his energy to this. He didn't focus on Namibia per
                    say. He said that that would happen of its own accord, once the Angolan “knot”
                    was untied. So most of his efforts were devoted to working out an agreement
                    between us and the Russians, for all intents and purposes, to get the Cubans out
                    of Angola. At that time the Russians already recognized that Angola was a
                    “wasting” asset and that they were getting nothing out of being there.
                    Therefore, the [Russians'] proxies, the Cubans, did not benefit them by being
                    there. [The problem with this analysis was that], by this point, the Cubans were
                    no longer the proxies of the Russians. They were there in their own right. I
                    don't think that the Russians were putting very much money into [Angola] at all.
                    And the Russians wanted “out” of there. They weren't getting too much out of it,
                    so there was a convergence of interest with the United States to try to resolve
                    this [problem], so that “the Russians” could get out “honorably,” rather than
                    being seen to cut and run, leaving Angola to [Jonas] Savimbi.</p>
                <p>Crocker had a very good, working relationship with the Russians. This was
                    probably the first example of a real convergence [of interest] between us. The
                    same is true of the Cubans. I'm telling you this, although I didn't work on that
                    aspect. I observed it. I sort of “backed him up” when the field of focus moved
                    over to Namibia, once the Angola issue looked as if it was pretty close to
                    [being] a “done deal.”</p>
                <p>In fact, I spent a good deal of my time working with the UN in getting their
                    transition assistance group into Namibia to start the clock rolling toward the
                    year of transition to independence. I spent a lot of time working on logistics
                    with the UN, arranging for “troop lift” and that kind of thing, [and]
                    negotiating with the South Africans on the terms of their withdrawal. That went
                    surprisingly easily. Crocker was right. Once [the] Angolan [problem] was
                    settled—but it turned out that it wasn't settled at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still going on today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: And much worse than it was, but without the Cubans. It's a sad but
                    inescapable reality that, once the Cubans were out of there, nobody gave a damn.
                    The Angolans are slaughtering each other and starving people, but that's just
                    not on our radar scope.</p>
                <p>Namibia, on the other hand, is a quiet success story. It's now been three or four
                    years since it became independent, and it seems to be working. The economy is
                    holding [together] quite successfully, and the white population that provides
                    the capital and economic know-how has not “cut and run” but stayed in place. The
                    economy is being “Africanized.” Namibia [was able to arrange] for the return of
                    Walvis Bay from South Africa without a peep, once the South Africans made it
                    clear that South Africa was going to have majority rule, too.</p>
                <p>I feel good about that. My role was certainly a peripheral one, but it's one of
                    the things I worked on that I feel turned out really well—so far, at least.</p>
                <p>Since this is nearly the end of the interview, I suppose I can make a little
                    philosophical departure here and reflect on my career choice when I entered the
                    Foreign Service as an Africanist, full of optimism and idealism, thinking that I
                    was going to be part of the “new” world and that Africa was going toavoid all of
                    the mistakes that everybody else had made. Looking back over it, I consider it a
                    striking display of naivete which, I have to say, was shared by many of my
                    colleagues. I don't think that I was alone in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an enormous amount of enthusiasm about
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Under the impact of the Civil Rights Movement [in the United States] and
                    the idealism of the 1960's, Africa seemed to be a kind of “tabula rasa” [a place
                    cleared of the mistakes of the past]. Here [we were] in the seventh decade of
                    the 20th century, and [the African countries] were emerging into independence.
                    World War II and everything connected with it were behind us. It was a new era,
                    of “flower power” and who knows what else? The reality is that everybody makes
                    his own mistakes. You have to crawl before you can walk. You aren't born a
                    full-grown adult. Everybody else in the world has to go through the [process of
                    growing up]. I don't mean that in any condescending kind of way. I don't mean to
                    [compare Africans to infants], but [those countries] were in their infancy as
                    national, sovereign states. They're still in their infancy, in many ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>It's hard to see what 35 years of U. S. involvement in independent Africa have
                    done for Africa. I don't mean that it's all our fault, by any stretch of the
                    imagination. Neither does it seem to me that what we have been able to do there,
                    either, in terms of diplomatic contact or military or economic assistance, has
                    helped much. Africa is a bloody mess, with three or four striking exceptions.
                    Botswana is one of them and Namibia also—ironically in the part of the continent
                    that seemed the most troubled in 1960—and which took the longest time to make
                    the transition. [Those two countries] may, in fact, have been blessed by that
                    [extended period of time] because they, unlike the [countries which] became
                    independent in the 1960's, seem to have been able to learn from their mistakes.
                    They also built up a kind of economic infrastructure during this extended,
                    colonial phase which those [countries] which gained independence in the 1960's
                    did not enjoy.</p>
                <p>I got out of Africa pretty much after my experience in the “Horn of Africa” and
                    moved to the Middle East, because I had the feeling already by the 1970's that
                    Africa [was facing growing problems]. I spent five, wonderful years in Somalia
                    and Ethiopia and really enjoyed [the experience]. However, within six months of
                    my leaving Somalia, they went through a coup d'etat, and the only “working”
                    democracy in Africa was finished. Two years after I left Ethiopia, [Emperor]
                    Haile Selassie fell, and the country was taken over by a communist or virtually
                    communist military dictatorship. It then sank into 17 years of civil war and
                    destruction.</p>
                <p>It's hard not to feel some disillusionment. I still have colleagues in the
                    Foreign Service who spent a full career in Africa and really feel gratified [by
                    the experience]. I didn't share that feeling. Now I think that we're looking at
                    real catastrophe in Africa. I would like to mention an article by Robert Kaplan
                    in the “Atlantic,” which many people have read but which you [say that you]
                    haven't read yet. I commend it to you. I have a copy of [the article] here. The
                    article predicts more or less complete anarchy and national disintegration of
                    much of the African continent, pointing out that in large parts of West
                    Africa—in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and elsewhere—this process is already well
                    under way. Kaplan says that he thinks that [the same process] is going to extend
                    to the Middle East, too. So I don't get a “pass” because I spent the second half
                    of my career working on the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It looks as if the “glue” that held things together—the
                        East-West conflict—kept things frozen on both sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: It's not at all clear that Africa in the long run was the beneficiary of
                    the attention of the East and the West generated by the Cold War. Basically, I
                    think that I agree with those Africans who say that they were essentially “used”
                    as pawns. When the Cold War was over, the pawns were simply discarded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, [the Cold War] held things together. Whether that's
                        a good thing or not is another...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>KULICK: That is not to say that the Africans themselves did not try to exploit
                    this artificial kind of attention. The Somalis were the worst [example of this],
                    and they're now suffering the consequences. However, all over Africa [the
                    various countries] played East against West for all they were worth. And what
                    they were worth, in most cases, was a bunch of useless weapons that are now
                    piles of rust. They are worse off—far worse off, economically—than they were 25
                    years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired after [your assignment to the Office of
                        Southern African Affairs]? When did you retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: I retired in September, 1989—mandatory retirement, I'm not ashamed to
                    say. I wasn't happy about it. I would have liked to stay, but not everybody can
                    be a general. I haven't regretted...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been in some very interesting places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: If anyone has the leisure to listen to this entire interview, he or she
                    will hear that I never regretted anything that I did in the Foreign Service,
                    with the possible exception of the two years I spent as a speech writer. With
                    that exception I never had a job that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. There aren't
                    that many people who can look back on a 23-year career and say that, whatever
                    their field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whatever their field. You're absolutely right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: So I feel very privileged and pleased at what I did in the Foreign
                    Service. I still think that it's a great profession, although I don't think that
                    it's what it used to be, sociologically, if nothing else. It's a very different
                    kind of institution now with the “turning inward” phase we are entering into [as
                    a nation]—neo-isolationism. I think that the Foreign Service will have less
                    attraction for lots of people. Certainly, it's not getting the kind of support
                    in terms of resources that it desperately needs from the national pie. And that
                    situation is only going to get worse. I look back on those years [in the Foreign
                    Service] with great satisfaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KULICK: Thank you.</p>
