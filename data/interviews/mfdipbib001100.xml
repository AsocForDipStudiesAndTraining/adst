                <p>THOMAS C. SORENSEN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Larry Hall </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 25, 1990</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Larry Hall, interviewing Tom Sorensen for the
                        USIA-AA Oral History Project. The date is July 25, 1990, and the place is
                        Albemarle County, near Charlottesville, Virginia, the home of Tom
                        Sorensen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BIO-SKETCH</p>
                <p>Tom, would you kindly give us a brief bio-sketch, starting with where you were
                    born and where you were educated?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I was born on March 31, 1926, in Lincoln, Nebraska, where my father was
                    a lawyer who was active in politics. He subsequently was elected to two terms as
                    Attorney General of Nebraska, and had two unsuccessful tries for public office
                    after that.</p>
                <p>I went to Lincoln High School, a public school, and to the University of
                    Nebraska, where I had a Bachelor's Degree with majors in Political Science and
                    in Journalism. I did graduate work thereafter in political science, although I
                    did not complete my thesis.</p>
                <p>Because my father and mother were intensely interested in public affairs, from
                    early childhood there were daily discussions at the dinner table about national,
                    state and international politics. I had a great interest in international
                    politics, fueled by World War II which came along at an impressionable age, when
                    I was a teenager.</p>
                <p>Early Pre-USIA Work in Journalism</p>
                <p>In graduate school, I specialized in international affairs. I went to work
                    virtually full time when I was 19 years old for The Nebraska State Journal.
                    Subsequently, for several years, I was news director of an independent radio
                    station in Lincoln, and did commentary, as well as news, and much of that
                    focused on international affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>So, when I saw in Editor and Publisher Magazine in November of 1950 that they
                    were looking for journalists with an interest in international affairs for
                    overseas assignments in the State Department's Foreign Information Program, I
                    was enthralled.</p>
                <p>1951: Entrance Into USIA Predecessor Agency:Beirut in January '52</p>
                <p>I had earlier met a fellow Nebraskan, Charlie Arnot, who was then head of IPS,
                    the press service, and so I applied. Things moved very slowly in those days and
                    maybe they still do. The full field clearance took a long time, but in November
                    of 1951, I joined the Service.</p>
                <p>I had earlier been told that my assignment would be Baghdad, as Information
                    Officer, but the Information Officer in Beirut had the misfortune to be married
                    to the sister of the British spy McLean so the poor man was dismissed from the
                    Service as a “security risk.” As a consequence, luckily for me, I got the
                    assignment in Beirut and, after a Washington orientation period, went with my
                    wife, Mary, and nearly two- year-old daughter, Ann, to Beirut, in January
                    1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, is it also true that you once had a student while you
                        were back at Nebraska, Johnny Carson?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Yes, I taught two courses in that period — I was a graduate student and
                    also working for the newspaper and then the radio station — two courses at the
                    School of Journalism: the basic “Beginning Journalism,” and “Radio Journalism,”
                    which was compulsory for speech majors.</p>
                <p>Carson was a speech major, an amiable fellow earning his way through college by
                    putting on magic shows in church basements. I liked his style, so after I
                    applied at USIA, I tried to get him to come to KLMS as Assistant News
                    Director.</p>
                <p>He thought about it and told me a couple of days later that no, he thought he'd
                    like to try to break into the big time and go to the Coast. I said that I
                    thought that was immature and so on, but I did offer Carson, as I recall, $35 a
                    week, a little bit less than he gets now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you, sir. Now, would you kindly elaborate a little
                        bit on the kind of assignments you had with USIA first, starting with Beirut
                        and then going on to your service in Baghdad and subsequently Egypt, and
                        then back in Washington, where you were controlling some of the operations
                        in the Near East and comment on the relationship of that work that you did
                        at that time to the foreign policy of the United States, the usefulness of
                        this whole endeavor to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SORENSEN: In Beirut, my first boss was a gentleman named Winfield Hancock Lyon,
                    Jr., who, I believe, was a political appointee, non-career. When the Democrats
                    lost the 1952 election, Mr. Lyon lost his job, and I had the wonderful good
                    fortune to have you, Larry, come down from Turkey and become PAO in September
                    1953.</p>
                <p>Our Ambassador, Ray Hare had a very high respect for you, as you will recall. He
                    also had a high respect for the USIS function. When I say “high,” I mean
                    relative to other Foreign Service Officers of his age and era, which wasn't to
                    say tremendously high. He felt it was a peripheral, but useful activity. So, I
                    found working with you extremely enjoyable, and with the Cultural Affairs
                    Officers at the time, Mildred Vardaman, and later John Nevins. I was in Beirut
                    for four years before being transferred to Washington for Arabic language
                    training.</p>
                <p>1956: Temporary Assignment to Baghdato Help Set Up Propaganda Side of Baghdad
                    Pact.</p>
                <p>After six months, I was asked by G. Huntington Damon, our Area Director, to go to
                    Baghdad on temporary assignment to help set up the propaganda side of the
                    Counter-Subversion Office of the Baghdad Pact. The Baghdad Pact, you will
                    recall, was that unfortunate notion of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. It
                    was a mistaken concept from the start, an alliance of unequals which most Arabs
                    (including most Iraqis) saw as simply the new face of western imperialism.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, we were so “successful” in countering subversion that there was a
                    coup d'etat in Baghdad two years later, and somebody told me — I'm not sure it's
                    true — that the Iraqi representative on the Counter-Subversion staff was one of
                    the conspirators in the Qasim Revolution.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was there for a few months, successfully resisted it as a permanent
                    assignment, and returned to Washington before Christmas 1956.</p>
                <p>February, 1957: Information Officer, USIS Cairo</p>
                <p>In February '57 I was sent to Cairo as Information Officer under PAO Bill
                    Weathersby. I was there until the spring of '59, when I came back to the U.S. to
                    the Agency to be the Desk Officer, Program and Policy Officer, for the Near East
                    — Lebanon, Syria, and Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in all of those jobs, you had a good chance to
                        observe the usefulness of the whole USIA function in relation to the whole
                        foreign policy of the United States in that area, which was largely
                        concerned at that time with the relationships — not exclusively, but with
                        the relationships — between the Arab world and Israel, and the peripheral
                        aspects of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Arab World's Love/Hate Relationship With U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>What do you think of the way that USIA fit into that role within the Foreign
                    Service community?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Well, then as now, the Arabs had a love-hate relationship the United
                    States. They believed, then and now, that the United States was responsible for
                    the creation of Israel, and sustenance of Israel, whom they viewed as an alien
                    intruder into their region. At the same time, they had a special affection for
                    the United States, stemming partly from our democratic institutions and our
                    Jeffersonian history, but also, in part, from the fact that the Americans they
                    had known in that region over the previous century had been benign missionaries,
                    teachers and medical people, who provided a great deal of assistance in helping
                    the development of the region.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Syrian Protestant College became the American University of Beirut,
                    which has survived, despite all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And created many Prime Ministers for most of the Arab
                        world in its time, did it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: That is right, but more then than now. So, there was this affection for
                    the United States and what the United States stood for in general, and there was
                    a disaffection for what the United States stood for in particular. That was at
                    the heart of U.S./Arab relations then, as it is at the heart of U.S./Arab
                    relations now.</p>
                <p>Role of USIA in Arab World in 1950'S</p>
                <p>Now to come around to answer your immediate question: The role of USIA, (which I
                    think I see more clearly now than I did then) was to provide sustenance for
                    those who wanted to maintain this American link. They needed to know about us,
                    to hear about us. Our explanations about U.S. policy were mostly futile, but the
                    flow of information about the United States, and cultural activities involving
                    the United States, kept the flame alive for the day when relations would be
                    better. We are still waiting for that day, but that was the function of USIA. I
                    think it was a valuable one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think it was a valuable one? I was just about to ask
                        you. In fact, that role, that long-term role, do you think that would
                        justify the existence of those operations in any case, even though we were
                        not able to foster specific, local, foreign policy objectives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Well, we wasted a lot of time and money and emotional capital in trying
                    to do the impossible, and that was both a strategic and a tactical error on our
                    part. But, what we did do, on the other side, on the long-term — call it
                    “cultural,” although I still have trouble with that word in this context — side,
                    was worth the money expended.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SORENSEN: There Is No Split — and Should Not Be —Between Cultural and
                    Informational Aspects of USIA Programs</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you comment, in a general way, on the different
                        roles? Is there a split between information and culture? Are these two
                        different things and do they blend into each other, or what kind of a mix do
                        you think the Agency might have had best in the Middle East, if that wasn't
                        ideal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I never thought there was a split. I didn't then and I don't now. If
                    one creates a split, it turns the purely information part into a kind of PR
                    propaganda machine, whose credibility is damaged by being separated from the
                    total presentation of the American story. We'll go into this further later on
                    when we discussed what happened subsequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I think the two belong together. I thought so then; I think so now;
                    and, of course, although they were then separated in Washington, they were not
                    separated in the field. The Public Affairs Officer was in charge of both the
                    cultural and the information programs.Although the cultural program was
                    back-stopped in the State Department, the Ambassador, in every instance that I
                    know and, certainly, in Beirut and in Cairo and in Baghdad, looked to the PAO
                    just as much for guidance on the cultural side as he did on the information
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that was generally true, although it may have
                        varied from post to post in intensity. I'm going to ask you a question in a
                        minute on the specific types of programs you think were most effective in
                        those days, in connection with your operating on the ground in Beirut, in
                        Cairo, in Baghdad, and from your viewpoint in Washington, as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Exchange of Persons Programs Was the Most Effective USIEffort in Arab World in
                    Late 1950s</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What specific kinds of programs, if you can think of some,
                        do you think were most effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I think a number of the programs had a positive effect. The exchange of
                    persons program certainly did. It brought adult leaders, opinion makers, doers
                    and shakers, to the U.S., and students as well. Their visits to the United
                    States had a positive effect on a great many of them, with both short-and
                    long-term consequences. The program also brought American academics and
                    performers abroad — useful, but probably less so.</p>

                    Also Other Media</p>
                <p>In Lebanon, where there were many small newspapers, all hungry for content, we
                    filled the papers with our press releases. I became skeptical of the
                    effectiveness of this; we were counting column inches, not changed minds.
                    Looking back, maybe I wasn't entirely right. The flood of column inches kept a
                    flood of information about the United States in front of the Lebanese. The
                    Christian Lebanese, who worried about their eventual fate in a vast sea of
                    Muslims, wanted to always have a contact, a tie, with the United States,
                    although they too periodically felt betrayed by the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from 1956 to 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: 1957 to '59. They were very enjoyable years, although Egyptians needed
                    permission from the Ministry of Interior to have contacts with us, so you knew
                    that the people you knew and were friendly with were all authorized “friends” of
                    the Americans.</p>
                <p>It was a period in the Middle East, at all levels of diplomacy, private diplomacy
                    as well as public diplomacy, of little progress. I didn't think we accomplished
                    anything. Even now I don't feel I accomplished much in the two years I was in
                    Cairo, except helping to keep that pipeline of information about America. Now,
                    of course, Egypt is our friend. Maybe we helped lay the base for that back
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The material providing that continuing contact was just
                        news stories about the United States in general, films about the United
                        States in general, nothing to do with specifics of foreign policy, but about
                        the U.S. and keeping them in touch with us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: That is right. We had a very effective Cultural Officer in Cairo for
                    most of the time I was there, Bill Lovegrove who now, sadly, is no longer with
                    us. Lovegrove was not at all politically minded. This, the Egyptians liked. They
                    didn't want anything political.</p>
                <p>I was clearly politically minded, and Lovegrove was ten times more effective than
                    I was. He had the usual suspects, you know, piano players and various artistic
                    ventures and so on there, all of which the Egyptians responded to warmly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But not to separate cultural items from information items,
                        I assumed that Lovegrove used USIA films and USIA books and even some of the
                        pamphlet material that you had available in his programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: His library was full of people looking at all of our media products.
                    All the various media were used. In the field, as you know, unlike in
                    Washington, there weren't walls between the media. They were mixed together and
                    used according to what the people on the scene believed was the best way to use
                    them. They weren't considered, in the places I served in the field, IPS programs
                    or IMS programs or ICS programs. They were post programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. You were there for a number of critical years as
                        far as relations between the Arab world and the United States were
                        concerned. Do you have any feelings about the Voice of America and its
                        Arabic or its English language programs into that area, or from your
                        experience in Washington, do you have any feelings about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VOA Was Listened To and Was Useful</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: The Voice of America was listened to. You will recall that we had
                    transmission facilities on — was it Rhodes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rhodes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Broadcasting a medium wave signal into the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As well as short.</hi>

                <p>SORENSEN: As well as short, but the medium wave had, by far, the greatest impact.
                    People listened to it. Again, it was part of the totality of this connection
                    with America that I talked about. It didn't make anybody change his views
                    overnight. But the Egyptians weren't dumb. They knew that their own radio was
                    hopelessly propagandistic, and so even though they might have not liked American
                    policy, they listened to the Voice (and the BBC) when they wanted to know what
                    was really happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. So, again, the VOA served, along with all of the
                        other arms of the USIA establishment, to keep up that continuing link
                        between people and the United States, even though they may have frowned upon
                        our foreign policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: There was another way in which the VOA was important. Nasser's regime
                    did not accurately convey to the Egyptian people, through the totally controlled
                    and nationalized press, what American policy really was. We could not get it
                    into the newspapers, because the newspapers weren't allowed to print it.</p>
                <p>We published a little newspaper called As-Saddaga (Friendship), which had
                    extremely limited circulation, restricted by the government. So the only way to
                    find out what American policy was, was to listen to commentary on the Voice of
                    America.</p>
                <p>Now, some people thought that the Voice of America was only for news and it
                    shouldn't appear to be an instrument of American policy because listeners might
                    think that it had something to do with the U.S. Government. But I never met a
                    listener to the Voice of America who didn't think The Voice had everything to do
                    with the U.S. Government. Nobody out there thinks it's an independent radio
                    station.</p>
                <p>While they wanted to hear the straight news, and that's what got, the editorial,
                    the commentary, provided them with an accurate description of U.S. foreign
                    policy in the area which they were not getting from their own media or from
                    their own government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you agree that that was a good idea, as long as the
                        commentary was clearly labeled “commentary,” separate from the news?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Yes, I do, and I fought for that then and believe in it now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, now let's talk about the period, your point of view
                        as the Deputy Director of the Agency, after your appointment under Ed Murrow
                        during the Kennedy Administration, and your view from the top of the Agency
                        as to its relationship with other parts of the foreign policy community in
                        Washington, with the White House, as well as the Department of State, and
                        then the effectiveness of the Agency and where its strengths and weaknesses
                        are, and perhaps with reference to specifics of foreign policy at the time
                        and your comments on the present and future, as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So, why don't you start there, with your appointment and how it came about?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Well, as you know, my brother, Ted, was the principal policy assistant
                    to Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts from 1953-1961 — though he and spent
                    most of the years between '56 and '60 with Senator Kennedy running for
                    president. Kennedy was nominated and elected in '60, and Ted was appointed
                    Special Counsel to the President.</p>
                <p>I felt a little nervous about this relationship during the campaign and my Area
                    Director, Bill King, sent me on an inspection tour of the region covering most
                    of the fall of 1960. So, when there were some leaks; as I recall it, Kennedy was
                    drawing on a classified USIA poll showing a decline in U.S. prestige, I was glad
                    to be thousands of miles away. I didn't have anything to do with that leak, if
                    indeed there was a leak, but it helped to have distanced myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A great piece of administration by Bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: After the election, Kennedy had, like all transitions do, a number of
                    task forces working up various position papers between the first week in
                    November and inauguration on January 20, 1961. The transition was being
                    coordinated by Dick Neustadt, a Harvard professor who is an expert on the
                    presidency and on transitions. Clark Clifford also was playing a major role as
                    the most experienced Democratic former White House man around in those
                    days.Taking a look at USIA was a group headed by one of Adlai Stevenson's law
                    partners, John Sharon, assisted by Lloyd Free, a public opinion pollster, who
                    had been in USIA —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean USIA before it was USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Before it was USIA, that's right, in the State Department days. Lloyd
                    Free basically drafted that report for the Sharon Committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>In addition to that, Senator John Kennedy — I'd met him a number of times since I
                    first returned to Washington on leave in 1954, and we'd nearly always talked
                    about USIA — asked me to give him an insider's view of what I thought USIA
                    should be doing and how it should be organized. I provided a report to him, one
                    of the main points of which was that I thought that the Washington separation of
                    the Cultural Program was artificial, unnecessary and unwise. I had a meeting
                    with President-elect Kennedy in early January 1961, at which he discussed the
                    memo with me.</p>
                <p>He asked me who I thought should be appointed Director of USIA. I mentioned Ed
                    Murrow, along with one or two others, but I'm sure I had nothing to do with
                    Murrow's appointment. Chet Bowles had presented Murrow's name and, of course,
                    Murrow's name was very well known to Kennedy, and Kennedy was known to Murrow —
                    not entirely favorably, at this point but that's another story.</p>
                <p>When Murrow was appointed Director, Kennedy gave him my report, which I gather
                    Murrow liked. Don Wilson, of the Washington bureau of Life Magazine, a very able
                    journalist and a close personal friend of Bob Kennedy — Susan Wilson and Ethel
                    Kennedy had been girlhood friends — had been nominated by the President to be
                    the Deputy Director of the Agency, a Presidential appointment.</p>
                <p>Wilson actually came before Murrow. He was selected first, and I was assigned to
                    the Office of the Director (Abbott Washburn was Acting Director during that
                    time) to help Wilson get oriented and so on.</p>
                <p>Murrow came in and asked me to help him get oriented, and in the process we
                    talked about everything. After a week or so, he said, “Do you want to be Deputy
                    Director for Policy and Plans?” It's what I had wanted and dreamt about but
                    hadn't expected, so I said, “Uh, uh,” and he said sharply, “Well, do you want it
                    or not?” I assured him I did.</p>
                <p>I asked him if this wouldn't create some kind of embarrassment. He said, “I
                    didn't ask the President, but I told him I was going to do it, and he said,
                    'Fine.'” Murrow was subsequently nice enough to say at the first staff meeting
                    that, “I would have appointed Tom Sorensen, even if he'd been my brother,” which
                    was typical Murrow humor.</p>
                <p>Sorensen's Intent to Reorient AgencObjectives and Operational Methodologies</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>What I wanted to accomplish in that job was fairly defined and not very broad.
                    Murrow had Wilson and me involved in everything, from personnel to budget, but I
                    focused on policy, on “the message.” I wanted to change the mission of the
                    Agency, both the written Mission that the President promulgates, (there had been
                    an Eisenhower Statement of Mission after the Agency was created in 1953) but
                    even more so the “lower case” mission as perceived by the people who worked
                    there. I wanted to see the President's mandate to USIA rewritten to make USIA
                    more of a pointed tool of U.S. foreign policy, rather than some sort of vague,
                    general, “Tell the American story abroad” (whatever that is), assignment. I
                    thought that loose definition meant 50 things to 49 people, and that it diffused
                    the effort and effectiveness of the Agency.</p>
                <p>I did not want to turn USIA into some kind of hard hitting Ministry of
                    Propaganda, not at all. But I wanted it to become an objective-oriented rather
                    than media-oriented organization.</p>
                <p>As I saw it, we should start with the objective: Identify what it is we are
                    trying to persuade people to believe about us. Then, but only then, create
                    products aimed at achieving that objective. In other words starting with the
                    result you want and working backwards, rather than starting from the product and
                    going out there and looking for a result.</p>
                <p>This did not require changing the tone of the Voice of America, although it meant
                    sharpening its editorials to reflect the views of the United States Government
                    and not the views of some editorial writer. The same applied to the other media,
                    but the issue was more crucial with the Voice of America, partly because radio
                    goes directly to the consumer rather than through the USIS field posts, but also
                    because the Voice, perhaps because it dealt directly with the consumer, had a
                    very special esprit de corps, a very special view of itself as an independent
                    radio. This view was fostered by VOA's very effective leader, Henry Loomis, who
                    had first come into the Agency as a Special Assistant to Theodore Streibert, its
                    first Director.</p>
                <p>I also wanted to see the Cultural Program managed by State, integrated in so far
                    as much as it was politically possible, into the total effort. (I say
                    “politically possible,” because the father of the program, Senator J. William
                    Fulbright of Arkansas, was absolutely opposed to having the activity in USIA,
                    and it didn't happen until Fulbright left the Senate.)</p>
                <p>I saw the Agency's mission, both in Washington and world-wide, as the peg on
                    which this all hung. I thought we ought to have clear-cut objectives in each
                    country. I was a big believer in country plans, plans that also were objective-
                    centered, that started with the objectives and worked back to operations. This
                    was the opposite of the all too common, “We've got a nice big Press Section,
                    we've got this section and we've got that section, now how can we use them to do
                    something helpful?” World-wide and at the country level, I wanted the USIA
                    effort to be honed to be more effective.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>So, I created in the Office of Policy and Plans, which was the operating part of
                    my job, a little operation to identify themes, which would apply worldwide, to
                    help the media focus on the kind of product that was needed. This way, a guy who
                    wanted to make a great film in IMS wouldn't be doing something totally different
                    from a guy who had this idea for a great commentary in IPS or somebody who had
                    an idea for a great books program in ICS, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
                <p>The idea was not to homogenize or politicize. The idea was to sharpen and
                    coordinate the message so that the Agency would have greater impact. Edgar D.
                    Brooke, who had been a PAO in Beirut (though I had not served under him there
                    except for three months when I was in Beirut on TDY during the U.S. Marines'
                    landing in 1958), returned to Washington to take on this extremely difficult
                    job. Ed got a lot of resistance from a lot of quarters, but in his — and this is
                    one reason why I thought he was the right man for the job — in his charming,
                    southern Virginia manner, he was a lot less abrasive than I was in those days,
                    and he went around smoothing feelings that I ruffled.</p>
                <p>USIA Gets New Statement of Mission</p>
                <p>Murrow supported this approach 100 percent. In due time, at our suggestion,
                    McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President for National Security
                    Affairs, asked Murrow to provide a new draft Statement of Mission for USIA.
                    Murrow asked me to draft it and I did. It went over to the White House, was
                    approved by Mac Bundy and the President and became operative.Well, of course,
                    just because you have a Statement of Mission doesn't mean that everything or
                    even anything changes immediately, but at least it's there, in print.</p>
                <p>VOA Fear That Policy Oversight at Agency LeveWould Damage Its Credibility: Turf
                    Battles Followed</p>
                <p>Now, there was then — although, perhaps, not as much as there was later, under
                    Lyndon Johnson, under some other presidents — this fear, sometimes touching on
                    paranoia, among some Voice of America staff that the policy people were trying
                    to interfere with their running a free and independent radio station, which
                    would somehow damage its credibility. Actually, its credibility, its virginity,
                    was equally precious to us on the policy side, maybe more so because we were
                    more interested in the objective-centered approach than were the people at the
                    Voice, but we saw it differently in execution.</p>
                <p>So here we have Edward R. Murrow, now Director of the United States Information
                    Agency, who spent a lot of time in his radio and television career battling CBS
                    management interference in product. Henry Loomis, a great bureaucratic
                    in-fighter, played this angle for all it was worth — which was plenty. He
                    massaged this part of Murrow's psyche constantly. Of course, Murrow knew what
                    Loomis was doing. Sometimes Murrow came down on Loomis' side, but more often on
                    mine.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Ed Murrow as a Program Administrator</p>
                <p>I have no quarrel at all with the way Murrow dealt with that issue. You know, he
                    had the reputation of being a poor administrator. Wrong. A good administrator is
                    one who could do just what he did, in balancing those two important aspects of
                    running a government broadcast station. I thought at the time he did it
                    brilliantly (perhaps because he usually agreed with me) and, in retrospect, I
                    still think so. I don't believe that Murrow ever lost the confidence of Henry
                    Loomis, while at the same time he retained my total confidence. That's effective
                    administration!</p>
                <p>Was USIA “in on the Takeoffs” as well a"the Crash Landings”?</p>
                <p>Back in 1960, and I guess it goes on until this day, there was always talk about
                    “being in on the takeoffs as well as the crash landings of American foreign
                    policy,” one of the grand old cliches of the business. It was actually used, I
                    think, in the Sharon Report, possibly in mine, and Murrow, not normally a man
                    for cliches, used it as well.</p>
                <p>He told Kennedy, when he was appointed, that he thought that should be the case.
                    Kennedy recognized that Murrow was a great Voice of America. I mean, Murrow was
                    the “voice of America” in many ways before he became Director of USIA.</p>
                <p>Kennedy, possibly because he was of the new generation, possibly because he was
                    an ex-journalist, possibly because he had very close ties to a number of
                    journalists, understood, better than any of his predecessors, how important this
                    element of political management was. “News management,” his critics called it in
                    those days. “Public diplomacy” it's called in foreign affairs. Kennedy grasped
                    the importance of the psychological aspects in the conduct of foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>However, that didn't magically transform the view in the Department of State.
                    Traditional, but able diplomats, from Chip Bohlen to Alex Johnson, may have
                    given it a little lip service, but I don't think they saw it as Kennedy did, and
                    Secretary of State Dean Rusk, certainly did not. However, Rusk had a good
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Robert Manning, (subsequently
                    editor of The Atlantic), his deputy Jim Greenfield, (subsequently foreign editor
                    of The New York Times), who did. As did Carl Rowan, who followed Manning as
                    Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, and of course succeeded Murrow as
                    Director of USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying, Tom, it's not enough to just say that you
                        have to be in on the takeoffs as well as the crash landings; you have to do
                        something about it. Murrow did what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: President Kennedy used the National Security Council as a kind of inner
                    cabinet on foreign affairs. The people at the NSC table were the people he
                    wanted there, including Murrow.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Kennedy later told both Arthur Schlesinger and my brother that Murrow didn't
                    speak up as much as Kennedy would have liked, but husbanded his thoughts — but
                    when he did speak up, he was listened to. Like the rest of us, he wasn't right
                    all the time, but Murrow had a lot of international experience, and he had a
                    judgment about the opinion of mankind that was shrewd and informed.</p>
                <p>USIA Was Not in on Bay of PigBut Were on Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
                <p>Murrow was not told, nor were many others including my brother Ted, about the Bay
                    of Pigs in advance. But Kennedy never made that mistake again, and the head of
                    the Agency was involved in all subsequent takeoffs, as well as landings in that
                    administration.</p>
                <p>I say “the head of the Agency,” because in the great crisis of the Kennedy
                    Administration and possibly of the '60s, possibly of the entire post-war period,
                    the Cuban Missile Crisis, Murrow was in the hospital and Don Wilson, who was
                    Acting Director of the Agency, served on the inner NSC, “EXCOM,” the Executive
                    Committee of the NSC.</p>
                <p>So, USIA was in on it. There might have been jurisdictional disputes with the
                    Public Affairs people at State, who were not represented in EXCOM, but there
                    were not.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of the crisis, when the Soviet missile launches were first
                    spotted by U-2 surveillance aircraft over Cuba, the President was insistent that
                    his hand not be revealed until he revealed it. He was a little unhappy, when I
                    had been lunching at the White House with my brother Ted, (who was and is
                    extremely discreet), and guessed that there was something big afoot about Cuba
                    or Berlin or something. In order not to have me speculating over at 1776
                    Pennsylvania Avenue, Kennedy, grumbling, authorized my brother to tell me at the
                    same time that Don Wilson was brought in.</p>
                <p>This was, interestingly enough, even prior to Pierre Salinger's being brought in
                    by a day or two, but it shows the value that Kennedy attached to USIA. He wanted
                    this story told abroad in exactly the right way so the U.S. would not be viewed
                    as the aggressor; that it was not developing a pretext to attack Cuba.</p>
                <p>I had the privilege (and pleasure) of writing the policy guidance for us and for
                    the posts, which was transmitted simultaneously with the President's speech. In
                    advance I wrote the policy guidance, a “talking points” paper; and we had a
                    press and radio commentary written. There was unhappiness at the Voice on that,
                    but nobody seemed to feel that it was a time to worry about bureaucratic
                    privileges.</p>
                <p>Serious Disagreement on Handling oPresident Kennedy's Speech at American
                    University</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>However, there was a real problem a few months later. I got so annoyed that I
                    remember it to this day. President Kennedy, in a speech at the American
                    University commencement, wanted to send a message to the Soviet Union that, in
                    the wake of the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis, we were now prepared to
                    try a new tack to ease the cold war. It was this speech that led to negotiations
                    for the underground nuclear test ban treaty of a few months later. That the
                    crafting, presentation, and dissemination of that speech was carefully
                    orchestrated. It was “public diplomacy” at its best.</p>
                <p>Mac Bundy was, I think, out of town; anyway, Carl Kaysen, his Deputy at the NSC,
                    worked with me on this and we worked with my brother, Ted, who was drafting some
                    language before Kennedy's final version. At speech time, all was ready and the
                    USIA policy guidance written and distributed.</p>
                <p>The Voice kissed it off, despite policy guidance. Well, this was a case where I
                    believed that the Administration's judgment was better than the copy editor's
                    judgment at the Voice, which after all is the U.S. Government's radio
                    station.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “kissed it off,” what precisely do you
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I don't now recall the details. It was maybe not the lead story, or it
                    was given short shrift. The Voice's daily commentary was on some other subject.
                    It didn't have impact. We didn't do our job.</p>
                <p>I raised holy hell about this, so Murrow summoned a meeting of Loomis and me.
                    Henry said that, in his opinion, the speech wasn't that important. Henry was
                    defending his turf and his men, and that's okay. But, I don't think it mattered
                    what Henry's opinion was or what my opinion was.</p>
                <p>Our boss, the President of the United States, was making a major innovation in
                    foreign policy and if the VOA doesn't participate in that, when does it? That is
                    an egregious example of what happened in lesser ways at other times, the
                    specifics of which I no longer remember.Of course, there is a natural tension
                    between the broadcasters and policy side that will always be there. Since
                    Charlie Wicks' directorship, this has, in part, been bypassed by having direct
                    satellite press conferences with U.S. government officials answering questions
                    from newsmen without having the intermediary of a policy officer in IOP (or
                    whatever it is called now) or a commentary editor or writer at the Voice of
                    America. Now, it is direct, and that's fine.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>The “WorldNet” interviews have been enormously successful. I travel abroad as a
                    businessman, and journalists tell me they love it, this televised satellite
                    press conference. I think it's a great innovation of USIA, and one of the
                    reasons it's great is it removes all the middlemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Do you suggest that — don't let me put words in your
                        mouth, but this implies something about the background of the particular
                        American official being interviewed, in terms of his own cognizance of how
                        messages get across, does it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Well, it does, and you've got to be sure that the official who is being
                    interviewed is someone who truly reflects the nuances of U.S. policy. While you
                    don't have a USIA middle man, the official is the middle man, in effect, between
                    the President and the Secretary of State — if he's not the President or the
                    Secretary of State, which he usually isn't.</p>
                <p>He can get it wrong, but I'd rather have him get it wrong than one of us in the
                    relaying business, so to speak, get it wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, the selection process of picking the particular
                        official who will be interviewed takes the place of providing a policy
                        guidance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Absolutely, Larry. I think that's a good way of putting it and it's
                    extremely important. I mean, it's almost as important as what the guy says,
                    because if you pick the wrong one or the guy who is not articulate or the guy
                    who can't handle himself, or the guy who doesn't quite understand policy, or,
                    indeed, somebody who may not be 100 percent in favor of it, it is — as you
                    government people say — counter productive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a sense, this suggests that the role of public
                        diplomacy needs to be understood by our top level spokesmen in whatever
                        department of government may be called upon to answer to a foreign audience
                        and should understand what public diplomacy is and how it works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Yes. I think that, although they may not know about or have any better
                    understanding of USIA now than they did 30 years ago, that the role of public
                    diplomacy by whomever — USIA doesn't have a monopoly on public diplomacy — is a
                    lot better understood now than it was then, and it's a lot more taken for
                    granted, including, in the Department of State at the upper levels, than it
                    was.</p>
                <p>Of course, we have a whole new generation of Foreign Service officers, or two
                    generations of Foreign Service officers, who have grown up in the field with
                    competent USIA people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, would you please say something about the CIA/USIA
                        relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: After the Bay of Pigs fiasco in April, 1961, the CIA's Deputy Director
                    for Plans, who was in charge of operations, was eased out of office along with
                    the CIA Director, Alan Dulles.</p>
                <p>John McCone came in as Director and the new DDP was Dick Helms. McCone told
                    Murrow, “We don't want ever again to get caught by something like the Bay of
                    Pigs, where the CIA believed that the people of Cuba would overthrow Castro when
                    USIA had polls saying the opposite. We're going to start a new
                    relationship.”</p>
                <p>Two things happened. One is that, for quite a long period of time, Helms came
                    regularly to my office and gave me general briefings on what the CIA was doing,
                    with particular emphasis in the psychological field.</p>
                <p>Secondly, from that time on, Murrow, Wilson and I were brought the very highly
                    classified daily CIA report by a courier who sat in our respective offices as we
                    read it.</p>
                <p>On Murrow's last day in office — I'm jumping ahead now, but in early January of
                    1965, Wilson and I were sitting there morosely and Murrow's secretary buzzes him
                    and says, “The CIA courier is here. Do you want to read it?” Murrow said, “Oh, I
                    might as well, it's my last day. On the other hand, I could wait until tomorrow
                    and read it in The New York Times.”</p>
                <p>We all laughed and Yoichi Okamoto, USIA's best photographer (later LBJ's), took
                    the picture of that, and is the picture that appears on the back cover of my
                    book. A similar photo appears in Joe Persico's recent wonderful biography of Ed
                    Murrow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The title of your book is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: The Word War: The Story of American Propaganda, published in 1968 by
                    Harper &amp; Row, with a foreword by Robert F. Kennedy. I should add that the
                    book obviously contains far more detailed recollections and views than this
                    interview could — and more accurate, too, as I wrote it in the several years
                    following my departure from USIA, not 25 years later as we are today.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Anyway, the relationship between USIA and CIA was cordial, was correct, during
                    the time I was there, both with Murrow and my year with Carl Rowan. I mean, I
                    have no way of knowing whether they did sneak somebody in, but they would have
                    no special reason to. They had a staff man, Bill Carpenter, who was a liaison
                    with my office. (We had liaisons with other foreign affairs departments.) So,
                    the relationship was good, and McCone and Murrow had a very good relationship
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>Anecdotes: Meetings With Jack Kennedy —Before and After He Became President</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. Is there anything else along that particular
                        line you'd like to say here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: There were a couple of individuals that I knew who were career CIA
                    people who were recruited into USIA, but when they cut their ties with the CIA,
                    their ties were cut. There's no question about it. They pledged that, and I
                    totally believed them. At least one of them went on to have a very distinguished
                    career in USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To clarify a little bit, when you mentioned the liaison
                        with the CIA, that was a special liaison with the DDP. We had always had
                        liaison at the area level with the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, do you have any anecdotes about President Kennedy and USIA?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: On my daughter Ann's twelfth birthday, I took her —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year would that be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: That would be 1962, February 13, 1962. I took daughter Ann, at brother
                    Ted's kind invitation, over to have lunch in the White House Mess. We went
                    upstairs to show her the President's Oval Office and all that, and while we were
                    there, the President came in. He chatted with us, and there was a very candid
                    discussion about lots of things including personnel that Ann was told she was
                    not to relate at school the next day.</p>
                <p>Then Kennedy noted that his Administration was being hammered by young
                    newspapermen out in Vietnam. David Halberstam and various others were writing
                    all this stuff because they “didn't understand U.S. policy” and what was really
                    happening. Since I was an ex-newspaperman and a USIA man, wouldn't it be a good
                    idea — said the President — for me to go out there, talk to people in the
                    embassy, talk to all these troublesome journalists who were stationed there, and
                    come back and give him a report?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Well, I said, “Yes, sir,” although I opined that maybe it wasn't a great idea
                    because my being Ted's brother brought the issue closer to his office than it
                    probably should be. He subsequently agreed. I can't remember now whether he
                    agreed on the spot or whether it was a day or two later. Anyway, somebody else
                    went out there.</p>
                <p>Of course, it was a mission impossible because the parties were irreconcilable.
                    You know more about that than I do, but that was, I think, Kennedy's first touch
                    of this, what later on became, of course, a terrible problem in both the Johnson
                    and Nixon Administrations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You met the President on other occasions, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I met him on a number of occasions. I first met him before he was
                    President in 1954, when I came back from Beirut on home leave, and my brother
                    had gone to work for Kennedy the year before after his election to the Senate
                    from Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>My brother, Ted, had had a temporary job for a special committee chaired by
                    Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. The committee's work ran out, and Ted liked
                    working on the Hill, and asked where he might find another job. Douglas said,
                    “Young Congressman Kennedy has been elected to the Senate and is looking for a
                    legislative assistant.” Ted said, “Well, I don't know, I mean, his father is not
                    liberal like you are,” and this and that. Douglas suggested that Ted go see him.
                    So, they interviewed each other and it worked out and Ted was working for
                    Kennedy.I had my own doubts about Kennedy. There had been all the publicity
                    either that year or the year before, I guess the year before, about his marriage
                    to socialite Jacqueline Bouvier, and stories about his absenteeism in the House,
                    so I thought, “This is a lightweight.”</p>
                <p>I had my reunion with Ted. He and I had always been close, since childhood. He
                    said, “Would you like to meet the Senator?” I said, “Sure. Why not?” So, he took
                    me into his office. Senator Kennedy had a great crop of hair and he looked about
                    18. That's before he cut his hair to look older.</p>
                <p>He said, “You've been Information Officer in Beirut the last couple of years?” I
                    said, “Yes.” He said, “Sit down.” For 40 minutes, he grilled me about the Middle
                    East. He knew a lot about the region. He wanted to know about all the players,
                    both the Arab players and the American diplomat players. He wanted to know all
                    the nuances. He grasped it all immediately.</p>
                <p>I emerged from his office awestruck. I said, “Ted, you've got a future president
                    on your hands,” which perhaps I didn't really believe, but I said so.
                    Thereafter, I saw him from time to time through Ted.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>My brother was living in McLean, Virginia. When I was in the States, I often
                    would visit him. He'd go by and pick up his boss, who also lived in McLean, and
                    then they'd drive and drop me off at USIA, and then they'd drive on down to the
                    Capitol Building.</p>
                <p>So, I saw him off and on, on various occasions, though not too many times after
                    he became President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom, I know it's 25 years ago, but you've been a student
                        of foreign affairs all of your life, perhaps more intensively now than ever.
                        Your business has always been in connection with foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So, how do you see, at this moment in history when Eastern Europe is becoming
                    democratic, in a way at least, and the Soviet Union apparently is much less of a
                    threat worldwide, how do you see the function of USIA or is there a function
                    left for USIA, the Voice of America or those other voices, the Exchange of
                    Persons Program, the whole bit?</p>
                <p>The Role and Importance of USIA: (1) In the Cold War Era, an (2) Now, in the
                    Post-Cold War Climate</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Well, like all of us, I suppose, I had doubts about the effectiveness
                    of what we were doing. It would vary from time to time. The temperature would go
                    up and the temperature would go down. Then, for a long time, I was particularly
                    skeptical about what we could do in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>But it is clear now that one of the reasons events moved so rapidly last fall and
                    winter was the existence of a very large group of people who had held on to a
                    lifeline with the west, with democratic ideals, with the United States.</p>
                <p>Not just the formal dissidents, important as they were, the Vaclav Havels and so
                    on, but a great many others who were dissidents in their hearts, Eastern
                    Europe's “silent majority.” For 45 years they were tuned into us, literally and
                    figuratively.</p>
                <p>USIA clearly played an important role during that long Cold War period, although
                    USIA was not the key factor, nor perhaps even a factor at all, in bringing down
                    those regimes.Now USIA can be important in helping new regimes evolve. They are
                    not all going to be democratic and there will be lots of difficulty and some
                    will have an easier time than others, but I think that the message of democratic
                    pluralism, conveyed in large measure to Eastern Europe (where everything else
                    was shut off) by the United States Information Agency, will continue to be
                    terribly important.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Eastern Europe is a great Jeffersonian victory. The moral stature of the United
                    States has probably never been higher. By example, by our history and by our
                    presence, we could play a major role in the development of these new societies
                    in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>I think USIA, with its now unhindered cultural and information programs, can be
                    enormously important. I think that that has also been true, though I was
                    skeptical for a long time, in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>I commented at the outset of this interview that the USIA is the guardian of the
                    pipelines, so to speak. There are other pipelines but this is the official
                    pipeline. It can be as important now as it was in the Cold War. But it will
                    require a lot of perestroika at home. It may be difficult for those who have had
                    a Cold War orientation for decades to switch to something else suddenly, but
                    switch they're going to have to do, or somebody else is going to have to do it
                    for them.</p>
                <p>The tasks of USIA have changed, but the mission of USIA now hasn't changed in the
                    slightest bit since the 1960s: to promote the broad foreign policy objectives of
                    the United States, long term and short term, on the psychological side. The need
                    remains.</p>
                <p>Now, USIA had a big Cold War constituency when it didn't have much of any other
                    constituency. Now that that rallying issue is gone, one worries about the
                    Agency's future. Perhaps ethnic groups in the United States, which were so
                    interested all those years in the captive nations, will perceive this role for
                    USIA, and continue or renew their support for it, but I think we have to worry
                    about it.</p>
                <p>A lot depends on what kind of president we have and what kind of Secretary of
                    State, and whether they understand this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are suggesting that we had a great role in Eastern
                        Europe, and you are saying that we continue to have a role. What about the
                        rest of the world? A lot of people are saying that the information
                        revolution, which makes it possible for even people in the Third World daily
                        to get private Associated Press and other news reports of what's happening
                        here, how do you see the need for an official role continuing, an official
                        voice, an official disseminator, continuing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I don't think it's essentially changed at all. For one thing, they
                    don't have access to the Associated Press because the government-controlled
                    newspapers in these Third World countries, most of which are not democracies,
                    don't allow the free flow of information. They may allow the Associated Press
                    in, but it is edited, government edited before it is printed.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The need to bypass the private media and make clear what the U.S. is and what it
                    stands for is as great now as it was before, and maybe in some ways it's
                    greater. A lot of those Third World countries had the Soviet Union as a role
                    model. They've lost that role model now. A lot of countries in Africa had a
                    cause in South Africa. They are in the process of losing that cause. Now, having
                    lost their role model and their cause, they are up for grabs, so to speak.</p>
                <p>Many of their leaders who have been in office for a long time and prant about
                    socialism and democracy while actually perpetuating themselves in office and
                    enriching themselves, these guys are going to be out of office. Eastern Europe
                    taught people power. It's a scary thing. They taught it in the Middle East, in
                    Africa, as well as elsewhere. I think that the role of USIA now becomes
                    tremendously important as the world goes through this post-Cold War period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think, in part, are you saying that the complexity of a
                        democratic, or a pluralistic, society is such that these countries that now
                        have the opportunity to become democratic need to know the difficulties that
                        can be encountered as well as the rewards that are contained therein?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: Absolutely. We need a vastly increased Exchange of Persons Program. I
                    don't know what all these programs are called now, but we ought to have a lot
                    more people from Eastern Europe coming here. We ought to have a lot more people
                    going to Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>I am personally very pessimistic about Africa, Sub-Sahara Africa. Outside of
                    South Africa, I don't see many signs of change there. But, why should one be too
                    skeptical when we see what results there were in Eastern Europe?</p>
                <p>I think that the USIA is important in Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, and Malaysia, the
                    Tigers of Southeast Asia, who have made enormous strides forward in their
                    economies but lag behind in their political and social structures. We ought to
                    be spending a ton of dough in Japan, whose relations with the United States are
                    going to be probably the most important in the next decade. At best, they're
                    going to be abrasive and, at worst, they're going to be a lot worse than that.
                    We've got to be there, and we've got to be there speaking Japanese — not just
                    the language, but the mentality.</p>
                <p>Business, the private sector, plays a big role now in all of this, not in the
                    socialist Third World countries, but in the developed and developing economies.
                    Nonetheless, there is still a need to wrap it all up, to explain what the
                    official position is, to be heard over that great cacophony of noise out
                    there.</p>
                <p>I am really higher on the USIA's need now than I have been at any time probably
                    in the last 20 years. We need it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will make a small point and then ask you a question
                        whether you agree or not. In the United States now, information and
                        activities have developed to such a degree that the private information
                        sector has become, in effect, a kind of shadow government, in a way,
                        constantly trying to bring its forces to play on the federal
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In a sense, if these are the conveyors of the only message overseas, it is not
                    quite a balanced program unless there is an official voice. Would you agree that
                    there is anything to that?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I think there is a lot to that. I wouldn't use the phrase “shadow
                    government,” because they don't have a program of their own. The media are
                    reacting and they are making it a lot tougher for our government than they used
                    to, which — as a taxpayer not a bureaucrat — I quite like.</p>
                <p>I mean, the idea that the private media can do it alone is absurd. American
                    newspapers don't circulate overseas. Except for CNN in a few places, American
                    television isn't seen overseas. American movies are designed primarily for ages
                    12 to 18 now, and I'm not sure that I want that to be the sole message of
                    America overseas, rock videos and all that kind of stuff. Maybe I'm getting too
                    old.</p>
                <p>But, I never thought the private media did it and they definitely don't do it
                    now. I travel abroad a fair amount and, you struggle to get your hands on a copy
                    of The International Herald Tribune or the European or Asian edition of The Wall
                    Street Journal. Occasionally, there is a wrinkled copy of some edition of Time
                    magazine, and that's it. The American media are not over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact, CNN is starting to export its
                        product, so there will be probably on a continuing basis, there will be more
                        television news made by Americans seen abroad, but would that upset your
                        argument in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I think that's great, but I think it's a long time before there is
                    broad, general dissemination. CNN is seen mostly by Americans in four-star
                    luxury hotels. The people we're aiming at don't see it. I suppose, if they're
                    smart, a lot of government offices are getting CNN abroad just to supplement
                    their news tickers, but I think it's awhile before we have general satellite
                    broadcasting with the airwaves full of everybody's message.</p>
                <p>But even then there will be an important place for USIA. Okay, so now we know
                    from CNN what Ted Turner stands for. What does the American government stand
                    for? Again, let's don't kid ourselves that USIA's just another radio station or
                    another TV station.</p>
                <p>Where Does VOA Belon in the Government vs. Privat News Dissemination?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. There has been some comment lately that perhaps the
                        Voice of America, which has desired this for years, as you have indicated,
                        should become semi-independent and not have necessarily the guidance of the
                        USIA or any other part of the rest of the foreign policy establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Do you think there is any merit to that?</p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I understand what it promoters mean by semi-independent. “Semi,” means
                    we broadcasters get funded, get our salaries and all expenses paid, by the U.S.
                    government. “Independent” means we broadcast whatever we like.</p>
                <p>I think that is absurd. I see no argument for a semi-independent radio station.
                    What is the point of it? In any case, anybody who has spent any time overseas at
                    all seriously talking to people about this knows that, without exception, people
                    believe the Voice of America is the U.S. government radio station. And so it is.
                    Passing a law saying it's semi-independent or putting it under a board of
                    trustees like Radio Liberty and saying, “This is an independent station,”
                    wouldn't fool anybody.</p>
                <p>I think it would be a big mistake to fractionate this business after all the
                    years it took to bring it together.</p>
                <p>Exchange of Persons Program: Where? Department of State or USIA?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about the idea that the Exchange of
                        Persons Program should go back into the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: I think that is an equally terrible idea. The State Department's
                    business is diplomacy, and there are already too many people who've gotten into
                    the diplomatic act. I don't blame the State Department's concern about the
                    proliferation of attach�s from other agencies and departments of the government,
                    but I don't think the State Department ought to get into other people's
                    business, either.</p>
                <p>The whole psychological area ought to be in one place, because when properly done
                    it is an integrated effort. The pieces belong together. You can artificially
                    separate them, as we did in the '50s and '60s, but it would still be
                    artificial.</p>
                <p>It certainly would mean a would mean decline in the influence and the value of
                    public diplomacy. If you believe in public diplomacy, you can't really believe
                    in breaking this thing up.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel the academic community would be any more apt
                        to support foreign policy public diplomacy were the Department of State to
                        be the custodian of the Exchange of Persons Program rather than the
                        Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: No. I've never seen any sign that the academic community thinks the
                    State Department is more pure than USIA. In any event, what the academic
                    community thinks (if there is such a thing as the “academic community” and I
                    doubt it has a monolithic view of anything); but if there is such a thing, I'm
                    not sure that what it wants should be decisive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine. Thank you, Tom, for all of this. Is there anything
                        else that you can think of that you'd like to add at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SORENSEN: No, but I probably will later.</p>
                <p>
