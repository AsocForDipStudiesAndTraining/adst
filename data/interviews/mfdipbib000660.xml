                <p>Interviewed by: Albert W. Atwood</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 1982</p>
                <p>Copyright 1999 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall the first time that I met you; it was at a very
                        busy intersection in Washington. My wife and I were riding with Mrs. Nelson
                        Johnson, wife of the former Ambassador to China and also a former Club
                        member, 1919-1954. It was an amusing incident because we stopped at this
                        busy intersection and you were going across as a pedestrian and - recognized
                        her and came rushing over to the car to greet her, both of you utterly
                        oblivious to the line of cars back of her! I was introduced to you at that
                        time. Unfortunately, I had never known Nelson Johnson. He died before I
                        really became acquainted with Mrs. Johnson. Did you know him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes. I knew Nelson Johnson in the Foreign Service when we were both here
                    in Washington after World War II. I had a number of anecdotes about him from
                    various Foreign Service officers. One of Nelson's favorite stories was about an
                    American going abroad for the first time, by ship. He found himself sitting at
                    meals beside a Frenchman who spoke little or no English.</p>
                <p>The first time they met the Frenchman said bon appetit, and the American,
                    thinking that this was his name, replied, “Jones.” Little more was said because
                    of the problem of communication. But at each meal the two exchanged the same
                    pleasantry, the Frenchman saying “bon appetite” and the American replying
                    “Jones.” Toward the end of the trip it occurred to the American that surely they
                    didn't have to introduce themselves on each occasion and that perhaps there was
                    some misunderstanding of an international nature. On the last evening on
                    shipboard as the two came to dinner the American decided to explore the
                    possibility that the Frenchman was not really just introducing himself but was
                    conveying some friendly sentiment, and so he spoke first and exclaimed, “bon
                    appetit.” The Frenchman was surprised and delighted and in the spirit of the
                    occasion bowed and exclaimed “Jones.”</p>
                <p>I heard Nelson tell this story many times, and it always brought roars of
                    laughter from himself, which of course brought much laughter from me. He seemed
                    to feel that this tale reflected the problems of international
                    understanding.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ken, I noticed from the records that you've been a member
                        of the Cosmos Club for some 30 years, joining in 1952. Do you recall who
                        your sponsors were at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: My primary sponsor was a geologist friend, William D. Johnston. He was a
                    very heavy man and yet seemed agile in the climbing of mountains. He was also
                    internationally minded and became interested in Thailand, an interest that
                    brought us together. He had an amusing way of talking and telling stories, and
                    we were often together at Scientist Cliffs in Maryland where we too had our
                    vacations. I had been encouraged to become a member by William Cullen Dennis,
                    the president of Earlham College, where I taught philosophy in 1939-41. At that
                    time I came to Washington, initially to make a report on the Japanese in
                    Indochina on the invitation of ColoneWilliam Donovan in August 1941 when he
                    began to set up the Office of the Coordinator of Information. But I was then so
                    preoccupied with the war that I didn't take time to appreciate the Cosmos
                    Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I understand it, you became a minister in the
                        Presbyterian Church in 1927 and shortly thereafter you and your wife were
                        sent to Siam as missionaries. I understand that you spent one year in
                        Bangkok, learning the language, customs, and traditions of the country, and
                        the next nine years as a missionary in various parts of Siam, as the country
                        was then known. Do tell me a bit about those ten years you had over
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: I became a missionary because of a series of sermons I preached in
                    Columbus, New Jersey, where I was pastor of a church while I was also a student
                    in the theological seminary at Princeton. I was one of my own converts. At
                    Princeton my studies had included Semitic philology, Hebrew, and Greek. So I
                    expected to become a missionary in the Middle East. At one time it seemed that
                    Margaret, my wife, and I might be sent to a place called Hilla, which was on the
                    road to Baghdad. But the only opening at the time was in Siam. The day before we
                    landed in Bangkok on a little 90 ton steamer going up from Singapore, Margaret
                    asked me to tell her all I knew about Siam. I said that I understood that most
                    of the Thai people were twins. She thought that was interesting and asked for
                    more information. I said they had a great many white elephants in the country
                    and I was sure it must rain a lot as I had seen a picture of the king sitting
                    under an umbrella built like a fountain with nine tiers. Aside from these
                    observations I didn't know a thing. I didn't even know where we were going when
                    we landed. Fortunately we were met and taken to a residence.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The same day we landed, our Ford coupe, shipped in a box from New York, was
                    unboxed and fueled and I had my first adventure in driving on the wrong side of
                    the road as traffic moved in the English rather than the American pattern. The
                    first year we spent in Bangkok studying the language. I've never been bashful
                    about languages so that as soon as I learned a few words I'd rush out into the
                    street and try them out on someone. My first two words were “how much” and
                    “expensive.” I went into numerous shops and asked “how much” while pointing at
                    something. After getting a reply I would say “expensive” and start out of the
                    shop. What followed in words was beyond me because I had not yet learned to
                    count. Feeling sorry for frustrated shopkeepers who would follow me down the
                    street while lowering their price step by step, I quickly learned how to count
                    so as to know what the price actually was.</p>
                <p>Both Margaret and I studied three hours a day with a teacher and then spent
                    another three hours studying for the next lesson. We learned the language
                    thoroughly as we expected to work with people and knew we had to be able to
                    converse with ease and without dictionary in hand. After six months I preached
                    my first sermon in a Bangkok church, not without some consternation in the
                    audience. An elder in the church came to me afterward and congratulated me on my
                    sermon and with a kindly smile said that I had told him something new about
                    Jesus that he had never heard before. I had said that Jesus was crucified on a
                    pair of wooden pants. The words for cross and for pants were close in sound, and
                    I had used the word for pants. I was as amused as the elder was. We discovered
                    that the Thai language required an ear for tone, for music, as the meaning of a
                    word or sound changed with the tone, whether it was high, low, even, rising or
                    falling, or acute either high or low. It was common for a missionary to ask his
                    servant for a tiger when what he wanted was his jacket. We discovered also that
                    some 60% of the words were derived from Sanskrit or Pali, classic languages of
                    India, and that the language was replete with terms derived from the Buddhist
                    religion, which arrived centuries before via Ceylon and Burma. So I knew I would
                    have to study India if I were to understand the people of Siam. I later studied
                    both Sanskrit and Pali at the University of Chicago, where I took courses also
                    on India.</p>
                <p>After a year in Bangkok we were assigned to Nakhon Si Thammarat on the east coast
                    of the peninsula facing the Gulf of Siam. A year later we moved across the
                    peninsula to a town called Trang (a Malay word meaning “light”). In Nakhon Si
                    Thammarat we lived in the compound of a girls' school with the principal, a Miss
                    Helen McCague.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Our first incredible experience occurred one Sunday when I was coming home from
                    church dressed in a white duck suit and carrying a Malacca cane. As I came up
                    the road toward the house, which was on the edge of town, I looked across a high
                    hedge and saw five servants of the compound standing and looking at something. I
                    came through the gateway, and to my horror I saw our newborn baby girl lying
                    naked on a mat with a sun helmet over her head to shade her eyes, but with a 12
                    foot king cobra encircling her and with its head erect and swaying above her
                    while it examined her, presumably to determine what to do with her. The king
                    cobra is different from the ordinary cobra, which is generally 3 to 4 feet long.
                    This is a giant breed that is not afraid of people and will attack, sometimes
                    without provocation. They may grow in size to between 9 and even up to 15 feet.
                    Such a cobra may strike chest high on a person while the ordinary cobra seldom
                    hits above the ankle.</p>
                <p>Well, I being a father didn't think of all this. I just let out a war whoop and
                    started racing across the lawn leaving my Malacca cane. The king cobra,
                    apparently recognizing a reckless father coming to save the baby, reared up an
                    extra foot or more to view the approaching conflict and suddenly took off like
                    an express train, spinning the baby like a top as it unwound. I later observed
                    portraits of Buddha in temples encircled protectively by such a cobra with its
                    coils keeping him safe from the monsoon wind and its hood spread like an
                    umbrella over his head. And as Buddha was a prince, son of a king, a mythology
                    developed that if one were so embraced by a king cobra that person was a prince
                    or princess. The myth was reinforced by the fact that a Sino-Thai infant was so
                    embraced and grew up to drive the Burmese out of Siam and become King Chao Tak,
                    a boyhood friend of the man who had him later assassinated to become king
                    himself, the first monarch of the Chakri Dynasty. I was frequently informed by
                    Thai that my daughter would grow up to become a princess and marry a prince or
                    even a king. She did, American style, marrying a football hero.</p>
                <p>Soon after this first dramatic experience with the wildlife of Siam I went on a
                    tour with the evangelist of the station, an elderly gentleman who was about to
                    retire and whom I was supposed to replace. He had been in Siam about 40 years
                    and was proud of his preaching ability. We went to the town of Singora. He then
                    set out to show me how to go about preaching. He stood on a box in the market
                    place and began to sing a hymn and soon got a crowd together. As he preached
                    there would be a murmur of awe now and then. I was impressed and went to stand
                    among the listeners in the hope that I might hear what they had to say. I
                    discovered that the murmurs of awe occurred when he made some dramatic shouts
                    when his mouth would open wide but his teeth would remain closed. This
                    performance held the crowd spellbound. I realized there was more to mission work
                    than met the eye. I had everything to learn, of course. In that part of South
                    Siam there was a large Chinese population on the rubber plantations and tin
                    mines. They did the heavy labor and were the commercial class. They also ran the
                    restaurants in market places, and this led me to decide to abandon the practice
                    of other missionaries who traveled with their own cook and equipment and to
                    depend on the Chinese cook-shops. And this led me into closer contact with
                    Chinese.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>As I went from town to town I discovered that the Chinese in Siam had no schools
                    to speak of. This was not surprising as they came from a coolie class in China.
                    They admired scholarship but had few scholars among them. I saw also that they
                    had money and could afford schools, and I talked to them about setting up
                    schools. And then I learned also that I could get little out of them while
                    speaking Thai. So I began to study Chinese while traveling about, my informant
                    being a Swatow Chinese who was an evangelist to the Chinese. In about six months
                    I was able to preach and converse in the Swatow or Tacho dialect. I was
                    surprised to have Chinese inform me I was from a village in China named Pho
                    Leng, because of my nasal intonations, of which I was unaware.</p>
                <p>When I was fairly fluent in Chinese I started a campaign in a town on the
                    railroad line largely inhabited by Chinese. The Chinese merchants would go to
                    the local opium den about 10 o'clock and again at about 4 in the afternoon for a
                    pipe or two of opium. I would follow along and sit on the side of the divan and
                    chat with them about schools. I would first select a good piece of land on which
                    a school might be built and find out who owned it. Then I would become
                    acquainted with that man, find out if he was Chinese, and follow him to the
                    opium den. I would talk to him about building a Chinese school on his property
                    that would be owned and operated by the Chinese community. The conversation
                    would move on to the bricks and lumber and roofing and labor involved, and then
                    I would ask him to bring together some of the leading Chinese merchants to
                    discuss ways and means. This first school took about a year to promote and
                    build—a modest effort that offered only primary education through the fourth
                    grade. I helped procure the teachers from Bangkok, Singapore, Penang. All funds,
                    materials, and labor were provided locally.</p>
                <p>A frequent question was what was in it for me—and did they have to become
                    Christians. My only suggestion was that they provide for a reading room for the
                    Chinese community and subscribe to Chinese newspapers and periodicals, and that
                    I would provide some Chinese Christian periodicals published in China and
                    Singapore. Over a period of about seven years was able to bring into being a
                    number of such schools along the railroad line and had a waiting list of
                    invitations from other towns on the west coast. Eventually all these schools
                    established Christian chapels and hired dual-purpose teachers who could function
                    also as pastors or preachers as needed. My parish extended from the Kra Isthmus
                    to the Malay border, a couple of hundred miles, and I toured the area traveling
                    by train, bullock cart, elephant, coastal boats, river craft, bicycle, and on
                    foot. In order to keep in touch with widely scattered Thai and Chinese
                    communities I began to publish a letter, which evolved into a brief monthly
                    journal in both Thai and Chinese. By the time we left Siam in late 1937 I had a
                    lively correspondence with Thai and Chinese, with my Chinese evangelist handling
                    the Chinese end of things. I could read hand-scribbled Thai and I used Thai
                    typewriters, but hand-written Chinese was beyond me. I still, in 1982,
                    occasionally receive letters in Thai and find to my own surprise that I still
                    have no trouble reading the script.</p>

                <p>As for Margaret, she was busy running a large household, having three children,
                    and acting as principal of the Anugun School for Girls. She was a very effective
                    educator and introduced a kind of primary education for Siamese children who
                    were able to read in a very short time as compared to the length of time that it
                    would take to learn to read in the public schools. They might be in a public
                    school for two or three years before they could achieve the skills that Margaret
                    achieved in about a year. This led the minister of education to come down from
                    Bangkok to inspect Margaret's program and methods. By the time we left Siam in
                    late 1937, I had a 10-year file of several Siamese-language newspapers and
                    periodicals as well as a library collection of books, pamphlets, and maps on the
                    area. There had been a coup d'etat in 1932 against the absolute monarchy, which
                    I felt was of historic significance and on which I obtained substantial
                    documentation over a 5-year period.</p>
                <p>After we returned to the United States in 1937, I resigned from the mission for
                    various reasons. But here's one anecdote that might show the cultural interplay
                    we had with one Thai village, a village on the railroad line near Tungson. I had
                    inherited a small notebook from a former Thai evangelist who had noted on the
                    cover the phrase: “Those that have been talked.” It contained a list of names in
                    the village and nothing more. The first time I visited the village I consulted
                    the notebook and began asking where the people were on the list. The village was
                    soon empty of people because they were alarmed by this stranger carrying a book
                    with their names in it. I finally convinced them of my innocent intentions and
                    eventually we became friends. I visited the village every few months and would
                    stay in the house of the village chief, sleeping on a mat at the end of a row of
                    sleeping children.</p>
                <p>One day, two of the men of that village came some 40 miles to visit us. I'd
                    stayed with them and eaten their food, and they stayed with us and ate our food.
                    They spent their days looking over the town and fields. After a week or so they
                    returned home. They returned about a month later with their village chief and I
                    could see they had something very heavy on their minds. They stayed a week or
                    more and again toured the countryside. Then they said they would like to have a
                    serious consultation with me. The village chief said that they liked me and my
                    family and that it was obvious that we liked them, too. He said, “You have a
                    very large compound.” It was about 6 acres because it had been acquired when the
                    mission was hoping to build a boys' school. It was an old pepper garden with
                    many wells.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>The village chief said, “You have many coconut trees, enough to feed a village.
                    And betelnut trees in plenty, which would take care of our chewing of betel.”
                    This was an aromatic kind of chewing tobacco that stained the teeth red at first
                    and then turned them black. The chief said that they purposed to move their
                    whole village over to our compound, and he said, “We think we could be a real
                    help. For instance, you could fire all of your servants (who were Chinese) and
                    we'd do all your compound work and the housework and take care of your children.
                    You have only one wife. You're a young man of great importance; so you could
                    have the pick of our girls and you could have a number of wives, which would be
                    appropriate to your position. And then instead of just the two children that you
                    have, you could have a great many that would really establish you here. And when
                    you went out, instead of going alone—we see you always have books with you- -one
                    of us could carry your betelnut set, you really ought to chew betelnut. It's
                    very good for you, for the digestion, very stimulating. Another one could carry
                    a spittoon. You shouldn't just spit any place. Another one could carry your
                    cheroots. You should really learn to smoke our cheroots; they are very fragrant
                    and settle the stomach. And we notice that every day you go on a bicycle to meet
                    some men and you rush around with a club and hit a ball. We'd be glad to do that
                    work for you. You don't need to sweat like that. And wherever you went you would
                    have an entourage that would show you were a person of importance. And then when
                    we got into trouble, why you'd take care of us and represent us before the
                    government, and you and we could have a very good and happy relationship.</p>
                <p>Now we have discovered some fields that you could buy, and we would work those
                    fields and you'd never have to buy any more rice. We'd raise your vegetables and
                    chickens also. And we'd be your people.”</p>
                <p>I was quite impressed and I thanked them warmly. But I told them that in the
                    first place I had a little problem. In about another year or so I would return
                    to the United States and then they would become orphans. And whether I returned
                    to Siam or not was problematical. I might and I might not. Furthermore I didn't
                    own the compound. So that I'd have to ask permission from the company that owned
                    it. They got the idea. They realized that although we would have been very happy
                    together it might not work if I returned to the United States. So that was the
                    end of that adventure.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One of my unusual experiences involved a missionary colleague named Dr. L. C.
                    Bulkley who ran the Trang hospital; a wounded tiger; a young professional
                    hunter; and Dr. Livingston's shoulder. When Margaret and I moved across the
                    peninsula from Nakhon Si Thammarat to Trang, south Siam, we had as a resident
                    physician Dr. L. C. Bulkley whose father was a prominent physician in New York
                    City and who insisted that his son also become a physician. But L.C.'s interests
                    were more veterinarian than his father anticipated and he became an inveterate
                    hunter of tigers and other game. We soon learned to count on the doctor's
                    vanishing on the nights before the full moon, during the full moon, and a day or
                    so after the full moon when he went tiger hunting. And we were very much
                    impressed by his achievements. His stairwell was literally fenced at the top on
                    three sides with tiger skulls ranging from huge ones in the middle of the “U”
                    down to cub-sized ones at the ends of the “U” - all of which glared at one
                    ascending the stairs to the second floor. The doctor was only too glad to show
                    pictures of himself with gun in hand and foot resting on the body or head of a
                    dead tiger, which he had presumably just killed.</p>
                <p>Looking at the pictures I asked him where each tiger was shot and how he did it,
                    and how he encountered the tiger. And I began to wonder at his replies, which
                    were somewhat vague, such as, “This one was killed over near Nam Dok.” Or, “Oh,
                    that one was shot while taking a drink from the Daang Creek.” And then asked a
                    direct question. “You did shoot them, didn't you?” And then he looked at me from
                    sad brown eyes and confessed, “No.” He went on to explain that he had a standing
                    offer of 10 cents to anyone who brought him an animal to look at with an option
                    to buy, even if the tigers were dead. As a consequence he had a parade of
                    enormous proportions passing by with every kind of wild animal from king cobras
                    to black panthers and tigers and young elephants. Dr. Bulkley tried several
                    times to get me to go tiger hunting with him, but I was not interested as I had
                    never had much success even shooting rabbits sitting on the ground and looking
                    at me. I had had some success shooting birds on the wing for some reason I never
                    understood. So tigers-definitely no!</p>
                <p>One night in 1934 or 1935 I had been to a church meeting and at about 10 p.m. or
                    so I was riding my bicycle slowly from the church past the hospital on the road
                    home. I saw a light in the operating room, which was separate from but connected
                    to the hospital and wondered why the doctor was working so late at night. I
                    turned my cycle in that direction and stopped at the foot of the steps leading
                    up into the operating room and could see through the open screen door the figure
                    of Dr. Bulkley at the operating table. I could not see any assistant working
                    with him giving anesthesia. The doctor was alone and he was chuckling some more.
                    I became alarmed and wondered if he was out of his mind and what he was up
                    to.</p>
                <p>I cautiously went up the steps and said, “Good evening, Doctor.You're working
                    late. What's the emergency?”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The doctor didn't even look up at me as I entered the room. He welcomed me as a
                    helper and told me to take over the anesthesia, chloroform, which he was having
                    to administer with one hand as the patient needed it, while engaging in surgery.
                    On the table lay a young man, little more than a boy, who, the doctor told me,
                    was a professional hunter, a boy who loved to hunt rather than go to school and
                    who had been required to attend classes but had managed to complete the
                    mandatory attendance, learning little or nothing. He couldn't even read. But,
                    this boy was going to become the luckiest boy in the world because, when the
                    doctor completed his surgery on the boy's left shoulder, he would have provided
                    him with a shoulder exactly like the shoulder of Dr. Livingston, who had been
                    mauled by a lion, also on the left shoulder. In fact, he announced, “This boy
                    might become famous because of his shoulder, the only one like the famous Dr.
                    Livingston's.”</p>
                <p>On a stand next to the table stood a model of Dr. Livingston's shoulder, which
                    Dr. Bulkley told me he had bought when he was first going through London en
                    route to Siam to become a missionary doctor. He had been a great admirer of Dr.
                    Livingston and in hero worship style had bought this model to inspire him in his
                    own missionary work. As Dr. Bulkley cut and sutured and did what surgeons do to
                    shoulders, be kept chuckling and talking about the boy and how it came about.
                    And I kept adding chloroform now and then and hoping I wouldn't give him too
                    much, which I knew was easy to do. I had seen my own little daughter, Peggy,
                    operated on by Dr. Bulkley under chloroform and suddenly turn white and stop
                    breathing only to be brought back to life when Dr. Bulkley dropped the
                    chloroform pad and gave her a shaking and slapping and got her back alive
                    again.</p>
                <p>What had happened was that Dr. Bulkley and his hunter went after tiger on a route
                    followed almost nightly by a tiger which the boy had studied. This was the way
                    tigers were usually shot—by cutting across the path of a tiger on his nightly
                    rounds and generally getting a shot in at close quarters. Most tigers were shot
                    with 12-gauge double- barreled shotguns, often with one barrel loaded with
                    screws and nails for the initial shot. Dr. Bulkley, however, thought this not
                    sporting and he carried a rifle—and perhaps for that reason never got close
                    enough to bag his own tiger. This night he had had a skilled hunter who brought
                    him in close for his shot—and he hit the tiger but only wounded it. It was dusk
                    and they followed the blood droppings for a while but didn't get another shot
                    before it became too dark and too dangerous to trail the tiger. Up to then the
                    young hunter had been in the lead and Dr. Bulkley behind. When they decided to
                    go back they reversed the order and Dr. Bulkley took the lead. They went only a
                    short distance when the wounded tiger leaped from the top of a termite mound
                    beside the trail and knocked the boy to the ground and seized his shoulder
                    intending to drag him off into the jungle. Dr. Bulkley was astounded and swung
                    around in the direction of the attacking tiger, and as he did his gun went off
                    accidentally and killed the tiger, fortunately missing the boy. It was the only
                    tiger he ever shot and he had not planned that shot!</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Making sure the tiger was dead and the boy alive but in great pain, Bulkley ran
                    to the nearest village to get help. He got some men to rip out a bamboo-woven
                    wall from a shack to use as a stretcher. They carried the boy on the stretcher
                    out of the jungle to the road where Dr. Bulkley's car stood and loaded him into
                    the back seat. Bulkley then drove to his hospital, which was about an hour's
                    drive or more away. When the doctor examined the boy's shoulder and saw the kind
                    of bone separation and crushing that had occurred it suddenly struck him that
                    this was a close parallel to the experience of Dr. Livingston. He brought out
                    his shoulder model, which indicated what the injury was and shows how it had
                    been treated. He then decided that with only a little extra help he could give
                    the boy the same kind of shoulder as his hero, Dr. Livingston. That was when I
                    arrived on the scene. I was curious about the boy and visited him daily. He was
                    in pain. and feverish, but like so many country Thai had remarkable healing
                    qualities. To entertain him I took a copy of Aesop's Fables in Thai and read him
                    some stories of the animals in the Fables. As a hunter he was fascinated with
                    animals and took a great interest in the stories. One day he remarked that he
                    wished he could read them himself, but was no good at it. He was not the first
                    young Thai whom I had known who had managed to go through as much as four years
                    of primary school and come out unscathed.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I had learned as a foreigner studying the language was
                    that the alphabet was phonetic and indeed was probably designed to help
                    assimilate non-Thai. There were clear indications, critical markings and
                    arrangements, that told one whether the tone was rising, dropping, high, low, or
                    acute—and whether the vowels were long or short, etc. So I began to show the boy
                    how the language was put together and how easy it would be for him to read, if
                    he really wanted to. Margaret had had a similar experience teaching a maid, Maa
                    Cham, to read. She caught on quickly and became so excited reading that for a
                    time she didn't want to work but read. Once the word was pronounced phonetically
                    the Thai who spoke the language immediately knew the meaning for most words. And
                    this was the case with the young hunter. I left him with the copy of Aesop's
                    Fables to read when he pleased.</p>
                <p>During the Eisenhower administration I was employed by the Operations
                    Coordinating Board, an adjunct to the National Security Council, and had my
                    office in the Executive Office Building. I think it was in 1956 or 1957 that I
                    had a phone call from the Thai Embassy asking for an appointment for the Thai
                    Minister for Adult Education. I explained that I was no longer on a State
                    Department political desk and that his call on me would be wasted but that if
                    they could tell me his interest or problem I would be glad to help him see the
                    appropriate officials. The Embassy officer said that it was a personal interest
                    and would take only a few minutes. And so we set a time.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The Thai official, handsomely dressed, arrived on time, and stood before me
                    expectantly for a few minutes without sitting down. Then he asked me if I
                    remembered him. I have always found this an annoying question, unfair really,
                    and thought to myself that this was going to be embarrassing to both of us
                    because he obviously expected me to remember him. My mind was totally blank, and
                    I made the usual dishonest response that I thought he looked familiar but
                    couldn't quite remember where and when we had met. He laughed at my remark and
                    then asked, “Do you remember a young boy mauled by a tiger near Trang who was
                    operated on by Dr. Bulkley?”</p>
                <p>I said, yes, I did remember such a boy and felt sorry for the young man in a way
                    because like Dr. Livingston who had had a similar experience, the young hunter
                    would never be able to hold his gun in shooting position again since he could
                    not raise his left arm into shooting position, and his work as a hunter was thus
                    ended.</p>
                <p>The Thai official then showed me that he indeed could not raise hileft arm to
                    hold a gun in shooting position and said, “I was that boy!”</p>
                <p>He then told me how he had gone on in his education and had now become Minister
                    of Education for Adult Education. He said also that he still liked to read
                    Aesop's Fables now and then but had long since worn out the paper copy I had
                    given him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ken, I understand that after you came back to the
                        United States in 1937, you went to the University of Chicago and obtained a
                        Ph.D. and a short time thereafter you went to Earlham College as a professor
                        and head of the philosophy department.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, I wish you would tell me a little bit of something

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LANDON: Well, I had gotten my M.A. at the University of Chicago in 1932, and
                    after coming back from Siam at the end of 1937 I went first to Harvard and then
                    to Chicago to see about graduate study. I chose Chicago because I could get the
                    courses I wanted and also was attracted by the plan of President Hutchins. His
                    idea was that if one was in residence for three successive quarters and if,
                    during that period of time, he was able to take the written exams in the chosen
                    discipline, pass French, German, and any other language requirements, complete a
                    dissertation and the oral examinations, then he could complete all the
                    requirements for the Ph.D. I decided that I would try to do it, as I was short
                    on money and time was urgent. Well, I about killed myself in the process and
                    finally, when I went up to get my hood, President Hutchins was sitting in a big
                    armchair on the platform. He looked up at me and then he looked at a little note
                    he had and he said, “I understand that you got your doctorate in three quarters
                    here under my plan.” And I said, “Yes, that seems to be the case.” He laughed
                    and said, “I always wondered who the damn fools would be who'd try to do it. I'm
                    glad you succeeded.”After that I became a professor of philosophy at Earlham
                    College. I got the job in a very unusual fashion. I had first tried to interest
                    various universities in Southeast Asian studies. I was sponsored by the American
                    Council of Learned Societies and by Mortimer Graves in particular. He sent me to
                    visit the Far Eastern departments of the universities of Pennsylvania,
                    Princeton, Columbia, Yale, Harvard, and Chicago and also urged them to take an
                    interest in Southeast Asian studies.</p>
                <p>As bait, one of my old friends, His Royal Highness Prince Damrong, who was in
                    exile in Penang after the coup d'�tat of 1932, agreed to let me locate at some
                    university his famous library collection, probably the finest in the world at
                    that time on southeast Asia. He had spent a lifetime collecting his materials
                    and got his start in World War I when he confiscated the collection of a German
                    scholar in Bangkok named Frankfurter. Damrong himself was a fine scholar and had
                    founded the National Library in Bangkok, also the Ministry of Education. But I
                    could not give his library away. No American university would accept it. The
                    great librarian Metcalf at Harvard said to me, “Mr. Landon, Harvard does not
                    have a course on southeast Asia. We would never use it. And he added,
                    prophetically, we probably never will have such a course.” Harvard, still, in
                    1982, has not discovered southeast Asia and has only trivial interest in Vietnam
                    because of its relation to China.</p>
                <p>I was up against it financially and I had to get a job. I suppose that my
                    procedure was very unorthodox. I drove to almost every college and university in
                    Illinois. Indiana, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania hunting for a teaching
                    position of some sort. This was in 1938 going into 1939. I finally got a job at
                    Earlham College out of a gas station on four nickels. I drove into the town, saw
                    the Earlham campus, went to a gas-station telephone, dropped in a nickel and
                    asked to speak to the college president. I didn't know at the time that he was a
                    sucker for telephone calls and seldom wrote a letter. We talked a while and he
                    asked me what position I was applying for.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I thought of my theological background as a Presbyterian missionary and knew that
                    Earlham was a Quaker school, so I decided not to mention religion. So I said I
                    was applying for a position teaching philosophy. The phone seemed dead for a few
                    moments and then President Dennis said that this was rather unexpected and a
                    little odd as that position had become vacant only the night before about 10
                    p.m. He asked how I knew about it. I said that these things got around rather
                    quickly and went on to present my case as a philosophy professor. After I
                    dropped in my fourth nickel I said to him, Mr. President, I've told you just
                    about everything I can over this phone, and that was my last nickel; may I come
                    to see you? So he allowed me to go to his office.</p>
                <p>President Dennis asked me many questions about what I thought I could teach. I
                    was prepared to tell him I could teach anything. Finally he said, “Do you think
                    that the head of your department at Chicago would believe that you could teach
                    all the courses we need here at Earlham? I said, very blithely, “Why don't you
                    ask him?” “Well,” he said, “I will.” And he turned around, picked up his phone,
                    and called the university. In a moment or so he had the head of my department.
                    Then a monologue went on in which he sat there looking at me while asking most
                    of the questions he had asked me. Finally he thanked the Chicago professor and
                    hung up and laughed. He sat and looked at me a moment and then said, “He says
                    you can!”</p>
                <p>So I got the job teaching philosophy. Later President Dennis told me that I had
                    three balls and two strikes on me to begin with, as he had a policy of getting
                    his philosophers from Harvard and disliked Chicago, that he was opposed to
                    having a preacher or a theologian teach philosophy on the grounds that they
                    lacked a broad outlook, and that he preferred a Quaker for the job as the
                    department of philosophy was supposed to be the soul of the college. At any rate
                    I got the job. That was 1939. In 1940, I offered the first course in Chinese
                    philosophy ever offered in this country for undergraduates, although of course
                    there had been graduate courses. I thought I was going on then in Asian or
                    Oriental philosophy as my field of specialization. I added Indian philosophy the
                    next semester. Then I discovered that although I was translating a history of
                    Chinese philosophy, Dirk Bodde at the University of Pennsylvania had the rights
                    to translate it; so I gave that up.</p>
                <p>Later in 1942 I gave the Taft lectures in Chinese philosophy at the University of
                    Cincinnati, and then a series of five lectures in the same field at Yale. There
                    were two Kennedys at Yale who wanted me on the faculty. One was head of the
                    Chinese language department and the other was a sociologist who specialized on
                    Indonesia. They wanted me to teach something on southeast Asia and hoped that I
                    could satisfy the department of philosophy, which had a teaching vacancy at that
                    time. At the close of my five lectures the head of the Yale department of
                    philosophy kindly gave me a protocol luncheon and took the opportunity to inform
                    me that they at Yale did not regard my presentations as real philosophy. He
                    said, “Your lectures on Chinese philosophy are nothing but ethics!” That seemed
                    to wind up my teaching of Chinese philosophy, but I continued for another ten
                    years as a book editor for the Journal of Philosophy, published at Columbia
                    University and edited by Herbert Schneider, writing reviews on books dealing
                    with Oriental philosophy.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I suppose I should say, that I had a couple of books published on southeast Asia:
                    one on Thailand, which dealt with the 1932 revolution, and the other dealing
                    with the Chinese in Thailand, both of which continue to be available in reprint
                    form in 1982. The latter book came out just before WWII, and I had the odd
                    experience of encountering a Japanese intelligence officer who had come to
                    Washington to see me while also attending an academic conference and who
                    presented me with his copy in the Japanese language of my Chinese in Thailand. I
                    told him I did not know it had been translated into Japanese. He said that he
                    had carried it in his knapsack throughout the war and that the Japanese military
                    had found it one of their best guides in dealing with the people of
                    Thailand!</p>
                <p>In 1947, the head of the department of comparative religion at the University of
                    Chicago, supported by Dr. Harley Farnsworth McNair, a historian on China,
                    invited me to give the Haskell lectures in comparative religion, hoping that if
                    we were mutually pleased they might offer me a position to succeed Professor A.
                    Eustace Haydon, who was the head of the department of comparative religion. So I
                    took leave from the State Department for one academic quarter to give the
                    Haskell lectures on religions in southeast Asia. The lectures later formed a
                    book, Southeast Asia, Crossroads of Religions, University of Chicago Press,
                    1949. I was shocked to discover when we discussed job possibilities that a full
                    professor's salary was only about half as much as I was already receiving at the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ken, with the heating up of WWII, I understand you
                        came to Washington and spent the next 25 years of your life in various
                        government services, mostly as the southeast Asia expert in the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes, I began in 1941, six months before the war. Margaret and I were at
                    Gull Lake, Michigan, and I was out in a rowboat with the kids when Margaret came
                    out and shouted that I was to go to a telephone at Hickory Corners and call
                    operator something or other in Washington. We'd had a friend who'd had a baby in
                    Union Station once before and I said to Margaret, “My gosh, I wonder if Agnes
                    has done it again.” I didn't know anybody in Washington. But when I made the
                    call I found I was in telephonic communication with Ernest Griffith of the
                    Library of Congress and with a ColoneWilliam Donovan. It was one of those party
                    lines with about eight other phones on it, and they all went off the hook to
                    listen in. The voices in Washington got fainter and fainter, but I gathered that
                    Colonel Donovan, speaking on behalf of President Roosevelt, wanted me to come to
                    Washington immediately and make a report on the Japanese in Indochina. I was to
                    get there just as fast as possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>I said that I was not a rich man and couldn't afford it, and I was on vacation.
                    Then I heard faintly that I would either be paid $15 a day or $50 a day, I
                    couldn't make out which. I said to Margaret, “Wouldn't it be wonderful if it was
                    $50.” And she said, “Well, it would be wonderful if it's $15. It's more than
                    you're making now teaching philosophy.” And I agreed that even $15 a day would
                    be splendid, which it was. So I went off to Washington. I think I was the first
                    substantive employee dealing with an area that Colonel Donovan engaged in his
                    new office of the Coordinator of Information in August 1941. We met in the
                    Triangle Building; Donovan had two secretaries and a receptionist and me. When I
                    arrived, they wanted me to put together a report in three weeks, which he would
                    then give to the President, on the Japanese in Indochina and their intentions
                    toward the rest of southeast Asia, particularly Thailand.</p>
                <p>I went to work and soon had two offices, one in the Triangle Building and another
                    in the Library of Congress. The second day, when I went into the Triangle
                    Building office, the door swung back and bumped into someone—a tall, bald-headed
                    man whose coat sleeves were too short for him. He said, “Hello, I'm James
                    Roosevelt. My father asked me to come to see you to be of any help you might
                    need in preparing your report for him on the Japanese in Indochina.”</p>
                <p>I thanked him and said, “Yes, I would like to know what the U.S. Government
                    already knew so that I wouldn't duplicate.” He said that he thought I should go
                    to G-2. I asked him what G-2 was, and he said it was “Intelligence.” I said that
                    was nice and where was it and how could I get there. And he said he would take
                    me. In about 10 minutes we were sitting in a limousine built to hold nine and I
                    almost got lost in the back seat. We drove a few blocks to the Navy temporary
                    building on Constitution Avenue and walked up to the second level where G-2 was
                    located, headed by a Major Pettigrew, a Japan language officer. James Roosevelt
                    informed the major that I was to make a report to his father on the Japanese in
                    Indochina and asked him to let me see what they had in their files on southeast
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>Major Pettigrew was very agreeable and called a sergeant and instructed him to
                    open the file case on southeast Asia for me. He went to a safe and located a
                    key, which unlocked a draw bar on a cabinet marked Southeast Asia. The top
                    drawer was empty and the two bottom drawers were empty. The second drawer held
                    one file folder, which he handed me. I opened it and discovered four articles
                    written by me for Asia Magazine published by the John Day Co. That was it!</p>
                <p>I asked Major Pettigrew what he would do in case he wanted to know something
                    about southeast Asia, and he said he would ask our allies, the British, the
                    French, or the Dutch.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>At the end of my three weeks I completed my report and turned it over to Colonel
                    Donovan. I'd been asked such questions as, “If the Japanese are going to move
                    against Thailand, when will they go?” “Is it likely that the Japanese might
                    bypass Thailand and strike farther south?” “Would the Thai fight the Japanese if
                    invaded, and if so how long could they resist?” Well, I didn't know much about
                    Japan, although I had written an article for Asia magazine entitled, “Siam Rides
                    the Tiger,” the tiger being Japan. This article had caused the Thai to put me on
                    their CID list as a person who should not be permitted to return to Siam because
                    they felt that my article put Siam in a difficult position with Japan.</p>
                <p>I didn't know anything about Japanese intentions, but I did know a great deal
                    about the terrain and the Thai because I had been both a country boy as well as
                    a city boy in Siam and I was very familiar with the royal family, the Thai
                    officials, and Buddhist clergy, as well as the geography, the rainfall, and the
                    seasons. With terrain in mind I said that if the Japanese were smart and if they
                    were going to move against Thailand, they surely would start in the first or
                    second week of December—no earlier because they'd be bogged down in the fields,
                    which would still be soaked by the monsoon season, and later than that they'd be
                    wasting their time as the rains would start again in late April or May. And then
                    I said goodbye to Colonel Donovan, and he said “Where are you going?” And I
                    said, “Back to Earlham College, it's time for the Fall semester.” “Oh,” he said,
                    “I can't spare you.” He wanted me to stay a few more weeks and asked if I would
                    stay if my college president would permit it. And I said yes. He turned to the
                    phone and in a few moments was talking with college president William Cullen
                    Dennis, who was very sympathetic, having been legal adviser to Chiang Kai-shek
                    at one time. Incidentally, he was also a member of the Cosmos Club. Dennis said
                    I could stay, “But, he has got to be back here to teach the spring semester in
                    January.” That was agreed, but Pearl Harbor occurred, and I never did go back
                    except to lecture or visit. So I was with Donovan for that first year. After
                    Pearl Harbor, Donovan wanted to make propaganda broadcasts. Arrangements were
                    made for the Thai Minister, Seni Pramoj, to make the first broadcast directed to
                    Thailand. And then I began to make broadcasts. We recorded on platters in the
                    facilities of the Department of the Interior, and then the recordings were flown
                    out to San Francisco for broadcasting. Then I became involved in helping
                    organize a Free Thai Movement, using Thai student volunteers under the direction
                    of the Thai military attach�'s Colonel Karb Kunjara, who had been trained in
                    England. The chief American training officer was ColonePreston Goodfellow. The
                    Free Thai Movement became an intelligence operation under the Office of
                    Strategic Services when that came into being. At first the Thai worked out of
                    China, but after the Chinese intelligence chief, Tai Li, had a couple of the
                    Thai killed and also interfered in other ways in Thai effectiveness, the locus
                    was changed to Ceylon as a way station en route to Bangkok. Before the end of
                    the war the OSS had agents located inside the Thai royal palace sponsored by the
                    Regent, Pridi Panomyong, the hero of my first book on Thailand.</p>
                <p>Although I left Donovan toward the end of 1942 for the Board of Economic Warfare
                    to select bombing targets and related activities, I kept in touch with the Thai
                    operations under Donovan and continued to make broadcasts in Thai.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>One of my most amusing incidents while I was at the Board of Economic Warfare,
                    which was headed by Milo Perkins, occurred when I was informed by Max Ways, one
                    of my many chiefs, to go and meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff about elephants
                    and the Stilwell operations in the China-Burma theater. I encountered them in a
                    building that is now part of the Department of State on 21st Street—very elegant
                    quarters that inspired me with awe and made me think I would like to become a
                    four-star general. I had never before seen so many medals in one room.</p>
                <p>They said they were faced with a problem in logistics because of the jungle and
                    mountainous nature of the terrain—how to move supplies—was it to be tractors? or
                    elephants? or both? They knew about tractors and trucks but they wanted to know
                    about elephants. I had traveled with elephants and knew something about them.
                    They wanted to know how many miles an elephant could go in a day. Well, that was
                    easy. I said 16 miles. They were dumbfounded to think that I knew that, and so I
                    explained that after an elephant has gone 16 miles he won't go any farther
                    because he's got to eat. And furthermore the staging areas in ancient Cambodia
                    were 16 miles apart. Then they wanted to know how many hours an elephant would
                    work if he was pulling things and I said about 4 hours. He had to eat 20 hours a
                    day to keep his belly full of leaves and bark, which he dragged down out of
                    trees, and even then if he was required to do heavy work he required a bucket of
                    rough rice for Strength.</p>
                <p>Then they said that the terrain was terrible and with deep valleys. They asked
                    how steep a hill an elephant could go up. I said that if need be he could go up
                    on his knees, if the load was not too heavy. And how steep a hill could an
                    elephant go down? And I said they were just like boys when it came to going
                    down. If the hill is very steep they would sit down, put their trunk up in front
                    and tail up behind, and slide on their bottoms, trumpeting all the way. I've
                    seen them slide 50 or 60 feet down steep banks into the Mekong River. Then they
                    wanted to know how much weight an elephant could carry on its back. I said they
                    had weak backs for their size and maybe 500 pounds would be the maximum, but of
                    course when dragging they could pull a half ton or aton or more depending again
                    on the terrain.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>This conversation sticks in my mind after all these years as one of the more
                    hilarious moments with the Joint Chiefs. As far as I know they settled for only
                    one herd of elephants in charge of a man known as Elephant Bill, whom I had
                    known briefly with the Borneo Lumber Company. Years later Elephant Bill wrote
                    two books on his elephants, and I have a copy of them both as a memento. I think
                    they might not have used the elephants if they had not talked with me about
                    them. Many years later while Ben Hibbs was still editor of the Saturday Evening
                    Post, I tried my hand at writing short stories and wrote one about an elephant.
                    One of their readers picked the story out of the slush pile as a possible short
                    story, which it proved to be. The story went into many reprints in about a dozen
                    languages and I received some fan mail on it. The letter that pleased me most
                    was from the head elephant trainer who was responsible for the herd with the
                    Barnum and Bailey Circus. He wrote to say that he had read the story many times
                    and hoped I would write more about elephants because he felt I knew and
                    understood elephants. I don't think I knew as much as he implied, but I liked
                    his letter.</p>
                <p>In late 1943 I was still in touch with the Free Thai Movement under Donovan and
                    sent out some telegrams to a General Timmerman (I think that is how to spell his
                    name) in Ceylon at Colombo. The answers unfortunately came back via the State
                    Department, not the OSS. I found out what the identification numbers were on
                    these highly classified telegrams and for the first time went to the Department
                    of State, Far Eastern Bureau, and was directed by a receptionist to see an
                    officer named Sabin Chase. I asked him to let me see these telegrams explaining
                    that they were the answer to my outgoing.</p>
                <p>Sabin Chase viewed me with absolute consternation and paled visibly and then
                    excused himself, and I could hear him hurrying down the hall. In a few moments
                    another officer burst through the swinging doors, followed by Chase. He informed
                    me that I could not see the telegrams and demanded to know how I knew about them
                    and proceeded to give me a scolding. So I too became angry and told him he was a
                    dummy, he didn't even know what the telegrams were about, that I had sent the
                    outgoing and I demanded the incoming, and if I couldn't get them from him in a
                    courteous way I would see his chief and if need be his chief's chief. I didn't
                    realize it at first but I soon discovered that the more I tore into him the more
                    he liked it, and he then introduced himself as Larry Salisbury and took me down
                    the hall to call on Political Adviser Stanley Hornbeck (a Cosmos Club member).
                    They decided that the best thing to do with me was to hire me, and so that's how
                    I became a political affairs officer in the Far Eastern Bureau.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>At that time it was a small bureau with only eight officers, I being the eighth,
                    with Joseph Ballantine as chief. There was an octagonal “FE” seal stamped on all
                    papers, and Ballantine told me that I would see every piece of paper that came
                    in and out of FE and that every piece of paper would have this octagonal seal on
                    it and I was to put my initial “L” in the northeast corner and no place else and
                    his “B” would be in the center. He also gave me orders never but never to take
                    any document out of the department home for study. He said this is the way
                    you'll get into trouble, taking papers home. So I obeyed that order and was very
                    grateful later on for the advice, because several of my colleagues did not
                    follow it and later had some problems of a security nature.</p>
                <p>Those were very informal days, and many people didn't realize that security was
                    becoming important. In fact, for a couple of years the files on southeast Asia
                    reposed in a drawer of my desk, which I locked at night if I remembered. I was
                    the first desk officer the State Department ever had who had lived in southeast
                    Asia and spoke a southeast Asian language. I was quite a shock to the nervous
                    system of the European desk officers on the French, British Commonwealth, and
                    Dutch desks because they had always taken the lead on any proposed action since
                    these were colonial areas. So now here was I in a position to become a drafting
                    officer, and I shortly found myself drafting policy papers for Franklin
                    Roosevelt on Indochina. What to do about Indochina? The President didn't care
                    for the French and thought they were very poor colonialists. He was determined
                    that the French should not return to Indochina. So I was assigned the job of
                    drafting these policy papers, which of course had to be cleared not only with my
                    masters in FE but also with the French desk and the superior officers in
                    EUR.</p>
                <p>Now this in a sense marks the kind of activity I had for most of the rest of my
                    25 years in government. I was always an Indian, never a chief. As for the policy
                    papers on Indochina for Roosevelt, I think I must have re-written them 30 times
                    before I could get the language well enough to obtain a “no objection” from EUR.
                    Eventually something had to go over to the White House, and I remember the
                    thrill I got when the original drifted down the line back to me and in the
                    margin, in fine clear handwriting I read, “I want no French returned to
                    Indochina, F.D.R.”</p>
                <p>I continued to be a political desk officer in the State Department until about
                    1954 in the Eisenhower administration. Foster Dulles became the Secretary of
                    State, and he launched a program to require departmental officers to become
                    foreign service officers. I had no desire to become a foreign service officer
                    for many reasons, but chiefly because I had no desire to go off to Africa or
                    Latin America or Europe and preferred to work on southeast Asia. Under the new
                    program it meant that if I were to continue in the Department of State, I would
                    never get any further advancement, in salary or position.</p>
                <p>So I called on Elmer Stats, who administered the Operations Coordinating Board,
                    an adjunct of the National Security Council, and was taken on with respect to
                    the area from Kabul to Saigon to Djakarta.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Bill Atwood has asked me to talk about one of my many trips to southeast Asia as
                    a State Department officer. After WWII, I went out in October for the
                    British-Siamese negotiations to settle their alleged state of war. The Thai had
                    declared war on both the British and the United States and the British had
                    responded in kind but we didn't. We went on the advice of the Thai Minister,
                    Seni Pramoj, that the declaration didn't really represent the Thai people, and
                    he refused to extend the declaration of war officially.</p>
                <p>At the end of the war the British had made 21 demands on the Thai, which if
                    accepted would have made Thailand a Virtual British colony. The problem was,
                    what could the U.S. do about these demands? I was sent out as a political
                    adviser, of sorts, to the charg� d'affaires, Charles Yost, who was about to open
                    our legation in Bangkok. Those were very unusual times, and I was able to write
                    myself travel orders authorizing me to go anywhere I chose to in southeast Asia.
                    The U.S. negotiator beat down the British demands until the 21 faded to about I,
                    which related to requiring the Thai to provide free rice for areas presumably
                    deficient in that grain. These negotiations came to an end in December to the
                    satisfaction of the Thai and the United States. During this period and
                    subsequently I had time to tour most of southeast Asia. on one trip I decided to
                    go up- country in Thailand to see the state of the nation. I had a car for my
                    use, a somewhat dilapidated Chevy, and I had two young OSS men plus a driver for
                    my car, as my escorts. I think that trip was in November, and I found myself
                    driving along a road behind some 90,000 Japanese troops walking along the
                    highway under their own officers with no Allied military around, going to their
                    camp to await repatriation.</p>
                <p>At first we thought it was a big herd of buffalo because of the dust and then
                    discovered these were troops from Burma and Thailand. The OSS men were driving a
                    jeep and both our cars had American flags pasted on the windshields. We had a
                    conference as to what to do and decided to go on. I said, “Let's just step on
                    the horns in both cars and see what happens.” So we drove up behind the troops
                    and blew our horns. Japanese officers turned and saw the American flags and the
                    uniforms of the OSS men and gave some commands and began to move the troops to
                    the side of the road as they continued marching. We of course drove slowly, and
                    it took us a long time to get past the troops. The officers all saluted our flag
                    as we drove slowly by. We went on into Cambodia.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Among other places I visited Angkor Wat, and I spent several days there and was
                    met by the French Curator who came up from Phnom Penh to meet me. He brought his
                    family along also, and we had an expert tour of the various temples directed by
                    the one man in residence who knew the most about them at that time. I took a
                    quick trip to Saigon and then went down to Singapore, where Pat Mallon was the
                    consul general, and on to Batavia, as Djakarta was then called, where Foote was
                    the consul general. Back in Bangkok, I received orders from the Department to go
                    back to Saigon and try to go up to Hanoi. At that time the British were supposed
                    to be taking the surrender of the Japanese south of the 16th parallel and
                    General Lo Han, representing Chiang Kai-shek, in the north. So I went over to
                    Saigon again and met with DeGaulle's representative acting as High Commissioner,
                    Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu. He had been a monk and had been brought out of his
                    monastery to become High Commissioner. He brought with him a mistress, a Madame
                    Galsworthy.</p>
                <p>I had read the Forsyte Saga and I was somewhat up on the Glasworthy family; so I
                    was quite intrigued by Madame Galsworthy, who was of the French side of the
                    family and bilingual in French and English. The admiral included her in our
                    first luncheon together as my interpreter because the word had gone ahead of me
                    that my French was terrible, which it was. I read French, of course, but I had
                    never tried to speak it much. The Admiral spoke the most beautiful French and I
                    had no trouble understanding him, and so, to my regret, I didn't see any more of
                    Madame Galsworthy. The Admiral was very helpful and arranged for me to ride to
                    Hanoi on a plane with General Salan of later Algerian misfortune. Well, General
                    Salan was supposed to go to Hanoi and take charge of the French community and
                    any troops that might be left over. The Chinese General Lo Han was in
                    occupation.</p>
                <p>I was told to join General Salan at the airport at 6 a.m. But how to get a taxi
                    to the airport? I managed it by paying a large sum to a driver—half of it the
                    evening before and the rest on delivery. I arrived at the airport without having
                    had time for a shave or anything to eat or drink. And the airport was deserted.
                    Along about 9 a.m. a few people drifted in, including a pilot of the C-47, which
                    was sitting cold and unattended on the strip. About 10 o'clock the General
                    showed up with his aides, well fed and well drunk on champagne. And I still
                    hadn't had anything to eat or drink.</p>
                <p>General Salan ignored me as we got on the plane and sat in bucket seats facing
                    each other, with the baggage piled in the middle. As we took off, without
                    warming up the engine, we all leaned forward on the baggage to keep it from
                    bounding around. In the air, I tried the General in English and he responded in
                    a mongrel French I couldn't understand. I tried him in Chinese with no avail.
                    Then I tried him in Thai and he showed interest—he speaking a Lao dialect
                    similar to Thai. So we conversed for a while. As he had learned his Lao from
                    mistresses, and I had learned from a sainted Presbyterian old maid, there were
                    marked differences in our selection of words.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>We arrived in Hanoi at about 4 p.m. after a stop at Pakse. I still had had
                    nothing to eat or drink all day. It was stinking hot and I was very depressed.
                    General Salan was met by a French delegation and they all loaded up their cars
                    and drove off leaving me absolutely alone, with no other cars in sight, on the
                    wrong side of the river from Hanoi and about 30 miles out of town. I had no
                    wheels and no Americans to meet me because there were no Americans, I thought,
                    after the withdrawal of an OSS mission, which had been there for a time until it
                    got involved in the political warfare going on among the French, British,
                    Chinese, and Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh.</p>
                <p>So I had a problem. I had a little tin trunk with me containing my belongings,
                    which I dragged over to the nearest building. At that point I smelled something
                    cooking and looked around the corner of the building and saw a Chinese GI
                    squatting in front of a charcoal brazier, making a bowl of stew. Well, I hustled
                    right over to him, squatted down beside him, and spoke to him in Swatow Chinese,
                    a south China dialect. Lo Han's troops were from the south. I took the family
                    approach and called him “Brother, Ah Hia,” and he looked at me in some surprise.
                    And I said, “Brother, I'm just starving to death. Brother, I haven't had
                    anything to eat or drink all day and I am very hungry. Will you sell me part of
                    your stew?”He sat back on his heels and looked at me perplexed and then said,
                    “No, it's all the stew I have and it's my dinner.” I began to urge him further
                    and he said he didn't want my money; he just wanted his stew. “Anyway,” he said,
                    “I have only the one bowl to eat from and we couldn't divide it.” And I said,
                    Brother, who needs more than one bowl in a hungry family?” And then he put the
                    clincher on me, he thought, when he said, “Ah, but I have only on pair of
                    chopsticks!” And I said, “Who needs more than one pair of chopsticks between
                    brothers?”</p>
                <p>Well, this struck him funny and he gave up the contest and so we squatted with
                    the bowl between us and we passed the bowl and the chopsticks back and forth
                    until there wasn't a morsel left.</p>
                <p>We squatted and looked at each other for a while and he asked me where I had come
                    from and what was I going to do. And I asked him if he could help me get into
                    town, and he said the only wheels would be a lorry loaded with Chinese troops
                    going in for recreation and he wished he was going too. So, I persuaded him to
                    hail down a lorryload of Chinese, about 40 of them standing in the open back,
                    packed in like sardines. He said he had this Chinese redhead who wanted to go,
                    too, and how about it. They stared at me in disbelief until I began chattering
                    at them in Chinese, and they gave me a hand up so I could stand among them going
                    in to Hanoi. And I stood there with my head bobbing around among theirs for some
                    30 miles. They put me off in front of the Hotel Metropole, but the hotel didn't
                    have any rooms they weren't full. So I said that was all right I would sleep in
                    the corridor. I carried a small mosquito net.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The next day I cleaned up, dressed as well as I could, and went across the
                    esplanade to the High Commissioner's palace, which had been taken over by Ho Chi
                    Minh, the alleged president and head of the Viet Minh, hoping with his new
                    constitution to head a new Vietnam free from French colonialism. I sent in my
                    card and he received me. I told him who I was, from the State Department. I was
                    fascinated to discover that he spoke flawless English, which I would call “TV
                    English” as it didn't seem to be any regional kind of English, just beautiful
                    English. Ho Chi Minh asked me how long I was staying, and I said I was just
                    taking a look around—maybe we would open a consulate after things settled down.
                    And he asked me if I could stay longer. I said I would stay longer if he wanted
                    me to but that I had expected to fly back in a couple of days with the plane I
                    had come up on. I added that I also had no place to stay. He asked me to stay a
                    couple of weeks and said he would provide a place for me to stay. And what he
                    did was to assign me to some quarters with an American graves mission hunting
                    for the bodies of Americans who had been shot down during the war. The house
                    where I went was large, and all the graves hunters were out in the countryside,
                    but the house was well occupied by their mistresses; so I had a lot of company
                    whenever I was there. Ho Chi Minh Provided me also with a tiny automobile,
                    French make, the size of a bathtub with just enough room for the driver in front
                    and me behind. We couldn't communicate except by sign language and I drove by
                    street map, pointing past the driver's face with my hand to indicate what
                    direction I wanted to go and making a chopping sign to tell him to stop.</p>
                <p>I had one meal a day with Ho Chi Minh most days, sometimes two, and we had
                    extensive conversations, always the same theme of independence for Vietnam, free
                    from the French and Chinese. He provided me with letters to the President and
                    Secretary of State asking that the American Government would help him keep the
                    French out, because as he said, “Your great president, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
                    didn't want the French to return,” And I said, “I know!”</p>
                <p>One day I received a delegation from the Vietnam-American Association to bolster
                    the line I had been receiving from Ho. They assured me that they were
                    nationalists and socialists, as was Ho Chi Minh, and not real Communists as
                    sometimes alleged. Their leader told me his name and I asked him to write it
                    down for me in my little notebook I carried with me. I said I wanted to be sure
                    and have the correct spelling. And he wrote “Le Duan.” Later, I learned that he
                    was the head of the Indo-Chinese Communist party. In subsequent conversations
                    with Ho he re-emphasized that he was primarily a nationalist and not really a
                    Communist. This was their party line, the same line they had been handing
                    Colonel Patti, the chief of the OSS mission, which had been withdrawn. In 1982
                    Colonel Patti wrote his story entitled Why Vietnam, in which he set forth at
                    length very much the same line that Ho and Le Duan had given me. I had the
                    pleasure of reviewing his book for the American Political Science Review.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>While in Hanoi I met again the French political adviser to Admiral d'Argenlieu
                    whom I had first met in Saigon. He was returning from Chung King where he had
                    been on a diplomatic mission to the Chinese. I flew back to Saigon with him on
                    his plane, and during the flight he gave me the details of the agreement with
                    the Chinese that he had negotiated and that was to be signed by both governments
                    on or about March 9. So as soon as I arrived in Saigon I put this information in
                    a cable to Washington and thus by happenstance provided the State Department and
                    other branches of the government the first details of this agreement. When I
                    finally returned to the Department in March, I was suddenly notorious for a day
                    and was beset with many questions, which I was unable to answer as I had already
                    told all I knew about the subject.</p>
                <p>One day at lunch, Ho Chi Minh told me of one occasion in the 1930s when he was in
                    Hanoi secretly working underground against the French. He was in a very relaxed
                    and bemused mood as he talked about those times. He said that the French had
                    been trying to capture him, and on this occasion in the 1930s they thought they
                    had him firmly trapped within an 8-block area surrounded by French police and
                    military. Ho said, “They really thought they had me at last. But what I did was,
                    I took off all my clothes down to my white underpants, but on a big coolie hat
                    that came down over my face, put on coolie rubber sandals, got a wide 2-seater
                    rickshaw, and had it loaded with a very fat Chinese market woman with a huge
                    basket of chickens on one side of her and baskets of vegetables on the other.
                    And then I, a little thin man, got between the shafts of the rickshaw and pulled
                    her right through the French lines. The French were more preoccupied looking at
                    the fat woman and chickens than they were at this thin little rickshaw puller.
                    He sat at the lunch table and had the heartiest laugh during my visits with
                    him.” He felt he had made fools of the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ken. This is Bill Atwood again and I understand that
                        when you first joined the Club there used to be several chairs that were
                        sort of honored for certain distinguished members and no one else dared sit
                        in them. Do you recall that incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes, I do. I was new in the Club. One day I came into lunch and sat at
                    the long table and I was frowned upon by a good many people and felt very
                    uncomfortable. I suddenly asked one of the fellows near me if I had made some
                    mistake. And a number of men spoke up and said that that was the chair that
                    Herbert Putnam, the Librarian of Congress, always sat in and no one else because
                    he sort of held court when he came and they had some fine discussions. I
                    realized that I was quite a comedown from the Librarian of Congress and I was
                    very glad to vacate that chair. I subsequently identified a number of other
                    chairs used by members who regularly lunched at the Club. I didn't get to the
                    Club every day of the week. Far from it. But I took care to avoid those chairs
                    used by the regulars and tried to sit near them so that I could enjoy their
                    pearls of wisdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ken, I understand that during your career in the Club you
                        served on the Admissions Committee through one of its most trying
                        experiences. I'm sure you have some very good reminiscences of that
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes. I had five years on the Admissions Committee. I had two years of
                    someone else's un-expired term and then three of my own, which seemed to me to
                    take care of my committee work for the Club for all time. I remember a number of
                    very interesting cases that came up. One was the night that the committee in its
                    wisdom rejected the artist who created the Iwo Jima monument, but with no
                    discussion voted in as a member a scientist who was the greatest living expert
                    on micro-organisms of some sort that ate the bottoms of ships in the Red Sea.
                    This was probably symptomatic of the scientific interests of the membership at
                    that time. I have noticed that everyone without exception considers himself an
                    expert in religion, politics, and art, regardless of how little he actually
                    knows. But when it comes to science, the knowledge has to be more substantially
                    founded. So art failed and science won on that particular occasion.</p>
                <p>The most noteworthy experience occurred when I was informed one night that I had
                    been assigned the portfolio of President John F. Kennedy, who had been nominated
                    for membership by John Kenneth Galbraith and someone I don't remember. I do
                    recall that I announced this unusual honor at home, and Margaret said later that
                    when I made my announcement I laughed like a crazy loon because I had just been
                    abolished from my job on the Board coordinating operations under the National
                    Security Council. McGeorge Bundy had called us together and read us a funerary
                    oration. Granted that it was better to be abolished than fired because you're on
                    the payroll and have no work. But you do have a hunting license to find another
                    resting place. And for four months I was in this ambivalent position. When I got
                    the portfolio of the President, I thought it was rather ironical that a possibly
                    discontented office holder should hold his portfolio. But of course, I was
                    determined with my Presbyterian and theological background to be quite
                    dispassionate. And then I discovered to my astonishment that a great many
                    members in the Club didn't want a President, any President, as a member, because
                    of the security problems and the inevitable upset to Club quiet atmosphere.
                    There was a great deal of informal discussion and some tension in the committee
                    to wonder what to do if someone blackballed the President's application. At the
                    same time a nomination for membership was made for Carl Rowan, who was a
                    newspaperman. He was not only a reporter and indeed a black reporter, which gave
                    him special attention because of possible racial prejudice, but he was also head
                    of the USIA in the Kennedy Administration. Rowan's nomination for membership
                    came up ahead of that of the President and there was some adverse discussion as
                    to whether Rowan was really distinguished in his field. I don't recall any
                    mention that he was a black man. Well, someone dropped in a blackball against
                    Carl Rowan, and he failed to become a member.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>That didn't shake the world, perhaps, but what did shake the world of the Club
                    was when John Kenneth Galbraith and a number of other people then wrote letters
                    of resignation on the grounds that the Club had discriminated on a racial basis.
                    It happened also at that time that I was briefing a man named Stevenson, a
                    cousin of Adlai Stevenson, to go to be Ambassador to the Philippines. Adlai gave
                    a reception for him. At the reception, which was attended by many of Adlai's
                    friends and admirers, suddenly his great hand came down on my shoulder and he
                    said, “Ken Landon, turn around here. Carl Rowan, I think you ought to know Ken
                    Landon. Ken Landon, you ought to know Carl Rowan better. Carl, Ken was on the
                    Admissions Committee of the Cosmos Club which just blackballed you.”</p>
                <p>Carl Rowan said nothing but looked at me with great distaste and I wondered what
                    to say. What I did say was, “Well, Mr. Rowan, I hope you appreciate what the
                    Club did for you. After all, we have given a man who had a parochial reputation
                    a national or possibly an international one. You really owe us a debt of
                    gratitude. But as for knowing nominees for membership, we on the committee make
                    it a point not to know them, so that we won't be prejudiced.” Adlai let out a
                    great guffaw and I left the party.</p>
                <p>Not very long after that the historian John Hope Franklin was elected a member
                    and so were one or two other black gentlemen who qualified. The Admissions
                    Committee then received letters from Galbraith and some others indicating that
                    as the Club was no longer discriminating racially they would withdraw their
                    resignations and rejoin the Club. The Board of Management, in its wisdom, sent
                    them letters saying that if they wanted to join the Club they would have to be
                    nominated (again) in the usual manner.</p>
                <p>As for the case of President Kennedy, as his sponsors had resigned from the Club,
                    his nomination was withdrawn and his portfolio was filed with no action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ken, during your sojourn in the State Department, I
                        understand you had one rather delightful trip out to Thailand for the
                        coronation of the King and subsequent marriage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes, that occurred in 1950. I had known the King as a young boy in
                    Bangkok in 1945-46. In fact, I was in the reception committee when he arrived in
                    the country from Switzerland with his brother, who at that time was King Ananda,
                    who was later assassinated. I had dinner with the Royal Family a number of times
                    in 1944-46 and I was familiar with their interests and their activities.</p>

                <p>In 1950 young King Phumiphon was to be crowned and married and his brother
                    cremated, in a sequence of events beginning with the cremation, which was a
                    Brahman ceremony for the coronation of the spirit of King Ananda, which would
                    take care of him. I asked the protocol office what they were planning to give
                    the young King as a wedding present and they said they were going to give him
                    some Steuben glass because he was interested in jazz music and dancing and
                    youthful activities. So I said the best thing to give him was a fancy,
                    modernistic Fisher phonograph with a complete set of Gershwin records. “Oh,”
                    they said, “we couldn't do that.” I asked, “Why not?” And they said it would
                    take the President himself to make such a decision and provide the funds from
                    his special fund. They said they didn't have that much leeway to choose.</p>
                <p>So I said I would write a memo to the President and clear it with protocol,
                    making the suggestion. Which I did. And the answer came back to protocol
                    approving the idea, and I was to go help buy it and take it out. So I did.</p>
                <p>At that time Edwin Stanton was our Ambassador and naturally he would make the
                    presentation. I had the pleasure of showing Ed all the workings and playing the
                    records to be sure they were all in good shape, and fortunately they were. We
                    were very pleased after the wedding to learn that when the King took his Queen
                    on their honeymoon this Fisher phonograph and records was the only wedding gift
                    he took with them.</p>
                <p>The National Geographic Magazine sent out W. Robert Moore, a photographer, to get
                    pictures of the cremation of King Ananda and the coronation and wedding of King
                    Phumiphon. Unfortunately, after arriving in Bangkok with all his equipment, he
                    got appendicitis and had to be in the hospital. So he farmed out his various
                    cameras to various people, and I was one of them. And there I was in white tie,
                    top hat, and coattails trying to take pictures at the same time I participated
                    in the ceremonies, where appropriate. At one time during a procession of the
                    King I made a mistake in protocol and got too high so that I was above the head
                    of the King. This caused some adverse comment in the newspapers, which pointed
                    out that this particular foreigner should have known better, which of course I
                    did. Other picture takers for Moore seized the opportunity to take pictures of
                    me taking pictures of the King, and one shot was printed in National Geographic
                    of this picture taker having his picture taken. In line with the King's interest
                    in jazz, I might say that the King got his wife from jazz sessions in
                    Switzerland. She played the piano, a jazz piano, and he played the saxophone. I
                    had known her first in Bangkok in 1945 when she was about 13 years old, and I
                    danced with her in the Suranurom Gardens. She had pigtails down her back and was
                    a very pretty little girl. At that time her father was being considered for
                    Ambassador to Washington. Lucky for her he was sent to London. She was one of
                    the pretty Thai girls who went often to Switzerland to entertain the brothers
                    Ananda and Phumiphon. Phumiphon fell in love with her. After his brother died,
                    many parents began pressing their daughters on Phumiphon as possible queen.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>One prominent family headed by Prince Dhani, a fine scholar and one time Minister
                    of Education, had a daughter highly eligible and looked like the front runner.
                    But Prince Dhani was a historian and a stickler for procedure and insisted that
                    the young couple must first call upon and secure the approval of the old Queen
                    Mother living in a palace north of Bangkok. This would entail requiring
                    Phumiphon to return from Switzerland, and he became inpatient and went ahead and
                    decided on the girl of his choice who had been playing jazz piano with him.</p>
                <p>In the Eisenhower Administration, when John Foster Dulles was Secretary of State,
                    he called me on the phone and said, “I am going out to Bangkok and want to take
                    a present to the King. “What should I take him?” And I said, “Take him an alto
                    saxophone. He doesn't have one. He has other saxophones but not an alto.” So
                    Dulles had such a saxophone purchased and suitably engraved and carried it out
                    with him.</p>
                <p>While speaking of kings and queens I was reminded of King Prajatipok and his
                    Queen Ramphaiphani, the King being the last absolute monarch in the Chakri line
                    who officiated at the time of the 1932 coup d'�tat which limited the monarchy
                    from that time on under diverse constitutions and military regimes. That King
                    was a dapper, slim man who loved to smoke huge cigars. At the time of the coup
                    he was having a constitution drafted by the American legal adviser, Raymond
                    Stevens, but the initiative was taken from him by the coup and subsequent events
                    described in my book Siam in Transition. The King wanted to disengage from the
                    scene but the military deprived him of that opportunity until he sought medical
                    attention and an operation for cataracts on one eye and was given leave to go to
                    the United States for the surgery. He then went on to England and settled there
                    until his death.</p>
                <p>Queen Ramphaiphani and many Thai were caught up in WWII, and the next time I
                    encountered her was at the end of the war in 1946 in a New York hotel. She and a
                    group of Thai students and diplomats were being repatriated, presumably to
                    Thailand, although I was given to understand that if they chose to go elsewhere
                    there would be no objection. So I was sent to New York to meet the group, which
                    were settled into a wing of the hotel, with some American constraints pending
                    further decisions. My job was not only to reassure them but also to find out
                    where they wanted to go and when.</p>
                <p>I walked into their area in the hotel and found them gathered in a large sitting
                    room reading and talking. They were all speaking in Thai, naturally. So I spoke
                    up in Thai and asked if I might meet them for a brief discussion of their plans.
                    The silence that struck that room made me feel that they thought I was the fox
                    entering the chicken house. They were at first very suspicious until a couple of
                    them and the Queen recognized me from pre-war times. I remember that one young
                    student in particular didn't want to return to Bangkok but wanted to go to
                    England—he had been in Germany—to complete his education. He later came to
                    Washington as Ambassador and then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he and I had
                    a good laugh as he recalled his initial alarm and then his pleasure at my help
                    in his going to England and not to Bangkok.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Queen Ramphaiphani came to Washington and during her stay sent word to me that
                    she would like to come to dinner at our house, which then as now was 4711 Fulton
                    Street, NW. One does not invite a queen to dinner, but royalty invites itself -
                    and she was being not only royal but wanted to see something of that remarkable
                    woman, Margaret Landon, who had written Anna and the King of Siam, which was
                    already in a movie starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunn. So we got the caterers
                    and trimmed up the house for the dinner.</p>
                <p>We heard the cars bringing the Royal Family to dinner and hurried to open the
                    front door. I had hardly opened the door when Prince Supawat, brother of the
                    Queen, came bursting in with great enthusiasm and upon seeing Margaret standing
                    with me exclaimed: “I am one member of the Royal Family that likes your book,
                    Anna and the King of Siam, about our famous King Mongkut. It is all true! I am a
                    painter and I know that every picture has both sunshine and shadow! He continued
                    to congratulate Margaret on her book as his sister mounted our steep front
                    stairs and came into our house more sedately.</p>
                <p>I had procured, while in Bangkok in 1945-46, a most complete set of classical
                    Thai records and I thought it would be nice if I could have one of my daughters
                    sit in an adjacent room, during dinner, and play some records. I picked a few
                    out and when I gave the signal at the second course of dinner, my daughter
                    started a record. Queen Ramphaiphani was startled at the music and her fork
                    dropped out of her hand and she burst into tears. She covered her eyes briefly
                    with her napkin and we were all stunned into silence and concern, not knowing
                    what had gone wrong. She dried her eyes and explained: “That particular music
                    was the favorite of my husband, and he had it played often by the Royal
                    Orchestra while we dined. The music brought back many happy memories when there
                    was no sadness!” I asked her if she would like to have my daughter play more
                    records and she said she would be delighted. And so the Royal Philharmonic
                    Orchestra of King Prajatipok entertained his queen at dinner in our home that
                    night!</p>
                <p>One of my most amusing memories, perhaps valuable for a time politically, was
                    when General, later Marshal, Sarit came to Washington before becoming prime
                    minister of Thailand in 1958. I had met him for the first time in Bangkok when
                    Ed Stanton was the Ambassador in 1950. My reading of the Thai language
                    newspapers led me to realize that General Sarit was going to become a very
                    prominent politician, and so I asked Stanton to arrange for me to call on him.
                    Stanton asked his military attach� to make the arrangements and the attach�
                    balked. He said that he didn't see that it was any of my business to call on a
                    General, which was his area of responsibility. He said that if I wanted to know
                    something military I should ask him to provide the answer. So I said to Stanton,
                    don't bother. I told some of my Thai friends I'd like to call on the General and
                    they sent word to him. General Sarit sent word back to me that the meeting would
                    be pointless because he didn't speak English. So I sent word back to him that I
                    didn't speak English either.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Sarit was amused and sent his car around for me. He was in command of the first
                    army tank corps in Bangkok, and his office was behind barbed wire, which was set
                    up as a maze. We had a very pleasant and unimportant conversation as he tried to
                    figure out what my interest was in him and I tried to figure out how able he was
                    and what ambitions he might have.</p>
                <p>So he came to Washington in the late 50s and by that time he was a big shot in
                    politics and it was only a question of time when he would take over the seat of
                    power. I knew this and he knew that I knew it. So he came out to our house for
                    dinner one night with his entourage of aides who filled the house. I still
                    remember that we had a caterer provide French food, which he stirred around on
                    his plate until Margaret served a turkey stuffed with wild rice, which she had
                    prepared herself. He then settled down to eat with great satisfaction and in
                    large quantity. We had a porch at the side of our residence that looked out on a
                    very quiet backyard. At dusk we went out to stand on the porch and the General
                    lighted a cheroot. As we were standing there a bit fat opossum came out from
                    under the porch and sat down on the grass and scratched itself. He looked at us
                    standing there and showed no alarm at all and finally, when he got through
                    scratching, he waddled out through the yard probably in search of his evening
                    snack. General Sarit looked at this animal in amazement and exclaimed, “Maa chao
                    woy, what's that?”</p>
                <p>I explained to him that it was an opossum, that they didn't have onjust like that
                    in Thailand. He asked me “Is it wild or is it tame?”</p>
                <p>I said, “It's wild.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Does it live here with you?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Yes, it lives here with me, under our porch.”</p>
                <p>He asked, “Is he afraid of you?” and I said no, he's used to me. Hsometimes
                    walked right past me.</p>
                <p>“Maa chao woy,” exclaimed General Sarit.Well, the birds were twittering around
                    the bird feeders in an apple tree, getting a final snack before bedtime, and he
                    admired them and asked me what I fed them. He wanted to know if they were wild
                    or tame. I said they were wild. He then proceeded to go through the same
                    questions he had asked about the opossum and when satisfied exclaimed again,
                    “Maa chao woy!” Then a mother chipmunk came out of a hedge at the east side of
                    stone steps that led up a steep terrace to the rest of the yard and proceeded
                    without haste to a hedge on the west side of the steps, followed by five little
                    chipmunk babies. General Sarit exclaimed in amazement, “Ai ya, what are those
                    animals?” And I explained what they were and that was a mother chipmunk taking
                    her children for an evening walk.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>“Maa chao woy,” he exclaimed, and asked “Are they wild or are they tame?” And I
                    said they were wild. And then the General went through the same questions again
                    that he had asked about the opossum. Were they afraid of me? Did they live with
                    me? And did I feed them? I assured him they took care of themselves in my very
                    quiet backyard.</p>
                <p>Then we stepped out into the garden and started up the steep stone steps. As we
                    went up, there were squirrels running around overhead. The General made no
                    comment but just observed them. When he came near the top of the steps of which
                    there were about fifteen, he stopped short of the top and stood silently,
                    absolutely dead still. Then he turned his head and asked me, “Ai ya, what's
                    this?”</p>
                <p>I stepped up beside him and there about four feet in front of him crouched a
                    great, fat rabbit chewing its cud, looking complacently at General Sarit and me.
                    “It's a rabbit,” Isaid.</p>
                <p>The General shook his head in wonder and exclaimed “Maa chao, woy” and then asked
                    the inevitable questions—is it wild or tame? Does it live with you? Is it afraid
                    of you? And while we were talking the rabbit casually hopped away into a hedge
                    at the back fence and disappeared. The general was silent as we went back down
                    the steps, but before we went back into the house he turned to me and said, “I
                    think I'm beginning to understand you. You've got the heart of a Buddhist, and
                    these animals know it and live with you.”</p>
                <p>Shortly after, in 1958, he became prime minister, and I flew out to Bangkok again
                    in 1960 while Working for the Operations Coordinating Board. At that time, Laos
                    was in a tense situation, and I flew there in the course of my travels in
                    southeast Asia. Coming back into Bangkok I landed one night at about 1 a.m. from
                    Saigon. An aide of the Prime Minister, Marshal Sarit, was at the airport to meet
                    me. He said that the Prime Minister wanted me to come to breakfast with him. “He
                    wants to talk to you about Laos and Vietnam.”</p>
                <p>I said that of course I would be very glad to do that, but—”you come out like
                    this at 1 o'clock in the morning?” And his reply was that Sarit wanted to see
                    me. So I went on to my quarters where I was staying with old friends and sent
                    word to the deputy chief of mission, Leonard Unger, to go with me if he could.
                    He came in his car about 7:30 a.m. and we drove to have breakfast with Sarit at
                    about 8 a.m. We were received in a very friendly fashion. There were just the
                    three of us—with numerous aides in the background but not at breakfast with
                    us.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>My conversation with Marshal Sarit was entirely in Thai, as usual. To my
                    astonishment Leonard Unger, who had been studying Thai during his lunch hours,
                    was able to follow a great deal of the conversation, occasionally asking what
                    some word meant. One of the things that bothered me during our conversation was
                    that the lights in the room gradually grew brighter and brighter until they were
                    almost blinding. And then the Prime Minister recalled his visit to our home in
                    Washington and the experience he had with the opossum, the birds, the chipmunks,
                    the squirrels, and the rabbit. Furthermore he recapitulated his questions to me
                    on each of the animals and his exclamations of wonder. Apparently, the visit had
                    really stuck in his mind.And then the lights began to dim and fade off and he
                    turned to other subjects briefly, and I thought to myself, thank heavens someone
                    had sense to dim those lights. And then Leonard Unger and I departed and went to
                    the embassy. Well, when I got to the embassy the phone was ringing like mad. Old
                    friends wanted to see me because they knew I was back in Bangkok. How did they
                    know, I asked. Why, I'd just been on live television with the Prime Minister and
                    they'd all listened to his tale about the animals in my backyard!</p>
                <p>While recalling some of my State Department experiences it might be of interest
                    for me to say something about my experience with the Kennedy administration and
                    with what became known as the counter-insurgency program and the establishment
                    of the National Interdepartmental Seminar under a presidential directive. After
                    I had been abolished by McGeorge Bundy along with the rest of the staff on the
                    Operations Coordinating Board, Dean Rusk graciously took me back into the State
                    Department. He really didn't have a job for me, and so I was put on hold in the
                    Foreign Service Institute on the grounds that I was a professor and teacher. I
                    found myself giving a two-week course on southeast Asia once every six weeks -
                    and I thought I might just coast out that way to retirement if nothing turned up
                    more exciting. Then I had a phone call from Walt Rostow after he and General
                    Maxwell Taylor had made a trip to Saigon toward the end of the first Kennedy
                    year, 1961, and they came back saying, “There's an insurgency in Vietnam and we
                    must counter insurgency.” Counter-insurgency became the clich� or touchstone
                    word for Kennedy policy in countering what was believed to be the wars of
                    national liberation sponsored by the Soviet and Chinese Communists around the
                    world. So Walt Rostow said, “Ken, I may have a job for you. Come on over.”</p>
                <p>So I went to his office and he had a National Security Council order in draft
                    form to be signed by President Kennedy to set up a training program to counter
                    insurgency—and, in particular, also, a country team training program for the top
                    brass in embassies, training ambassadors, generals, colonels, and the top
                    officials in CIA, USIA, and so forth. And Walt offered me the job of concocting
                    such a program under the directive. And I said something that came out sounding
                    like yes, sir. And I read the NSC draft looking for just one thing, money. I
                    wanted a blank check that the Under Secretary of State for administration would
                    honor when I began spending money.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Soon I met a committee that met under General Taylor and included General Krulak
                    for the military, Alexis Johnson for State, Walt Rostow, and some others. I was
                    given a very general directive because they didn't know what they wanted, not
                    even how many weeks the training program should be, and I didn't know what I was
                    going to be able to provide. That was in early 1962. I was told the first class
                    would consist of 60 senior officials and they would arrive the first week in
                    June. As I got started in March I saw I had a lot to do, setting up quarters at
                    the Foreign Service Institute, establishing a reference and study library
                    collection, and arranging for faculty - but, first and foremost, inventing a
                    curriculum on how to counter insurgency. I was bemused to think that I was
                    expected to dream up how to counter insurgency while from the time I was a boy I
                    had always been on the other side, more insurgent than counter insurgent. But
                    then I regarded this as an academic exercise and I didn't think anybody else
                    knew any more than I did or didn't about how to counter insurgency, anyway.</p>
                <p>Walt Rostow suggested that I go up to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                    and discuss curriculum with Max Millikan, Lucian Pye, Everett Hagen, and various
                    others, who might also become some of the lecturers. These were scholars writing
                    and doing research on economic development, social change, and political
                    development. They were very helpful with suggestions, and I settled down to
                    develop a bibliography as of first importance, on which base I might arrange a
                    course of study and lectures. I ordered 50 copies of each book that I bought on
                    the theory that such high officials shouldn't wait to use the books they needed.
                    I drafted sample courses for various lengths of time from four weeks to eight
                    weeks, and after some discussion with the overseeing committee we agreed that
                    five weeks was about right and also was as long as we could expect high
                    officials to sit still for such study.About six weeks before the first class,
                    Rostow phoned me, “I told you that all 60 of these officers were to go east
                    Asia, but now we want to divide the class and send some to Latin America. Can
                    you modify the program to make that possible?” So naturally I said something
                    that sounded like yes, sir and hired some Latin America experts to concoct
                    parallel bibliography, lecturers, etc. etc. I might say that for the second
                    class, which was held a few weeks after the close of this first one, the program
                    was extended to cover Africa and subsequently the Middle East and South Asia. So
                    it was evident that in the Kennedy administration it was the policy to consider
                    the Communist conspiracy as worldwide and emanating from Moscow, even though in
                    1960, Professor Zagoria had written his book showing that China had parted from
                    the Soviet Union as a fellow conspirator and that nationalist differences were
                    clearly emerging within communist movements around the world.</p>
                <p>In addition to this so-called Country Team Seminar, I was asked to arrange and
                    chair a series of six lectures in the main auditorium of the State Department,
                    which would seat about 400, to be attended by all officers above GS-7. This
                    series of six lectures was kicked off by the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, and
                    by Walt Rostow. Walt told me he would give one lecture on every sequence of
                    lectures, but I think he gave only that first lecture and left me to it. The
                    military also arranged for similar general lectures and some 50,000 of their
                    officers went through such a course the first year. I lectured in many of their
                    programs, also.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>After the Country Team Seminar had been going for about six months it was given a
                    more fancy name: National Interdepartmental Seminar, and we moved at great
                    expense into new quarters, a former -restaurant facing the Iwo Jima monument,
                    introducing the most modern teaching aids and equipment then available. At the
                    end of my year at this job I was phased out, and an ambassador on leave was
                    given the job of administering the seminar. I became Dean of Area Studies at the
                    Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>The first graduating class of the Country Team Seminar was very interesting to
                    me. It included a General Joseph Stilwell, son of the famous “Vinegar” Joe
                    Stilwell of the China-Burma theater. General Stilwell came reluctantly the first
                    week with no enthusiasm, under the presidential directive. He made a move to
                    goof off on Thursday by informing me that he was departing for New York at 1500
                    that day and would not therefore return after lunch, and he would return on
                    Monday at 0900. So for the fun of it, and also meaning it, I said, “Negative,
                    General.”</p>
                <p>He was startled and said, “Negative?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Negative. You are here under a presidential directive, and how would
                    it look to the President if you went off to New York?” “I see your point,” he
                    said, and we both laughed.</p>
                <p>General Stilwell was not exactly a reader of books, and the bibliography I had
                    assigned for reading was imposing. Toward the end of that first week General
                    Stilwell stood up in class and said, “Professor, I have a question a good many
                    of us are asking. Do you expect us to read all of those assignments?”</p>
                <p>I said, “General, I developed these assignments on my understanding of the habits
                    of chickens. If you scatter grain in front of a chicken, he will pick enough
                    grain to take care of his appetite. If you tie him by the leg beside a small
                    pile of grain he will eat and eat until it is gone. But if you tie him by the
                    leg beside 5 pounds of grain he will peck until he has to lie down beside it and
                    will continue pecking and that's what I expect you all to do.” They were all
                    very good natured about it and I think they did more reading than they or I had
                    anticipated.</p>
                <p>President Kennedy wanted to meet the graduates of that first class. He wanted to
                    see what kind of people would be countering insurgency, and perhaps inspire them
                    a little. So I had the honor of taking the 60 senior officers over to the White
                    House. They stood in a small group near the White House, and I walked around by
                    the President's office at the French doors there to let him know we were waiting
                    for him. He looked up slightly startled and said, “What do you want?” And I said
                    that I was there with a class of 60 senior officials who had taken a course of
                    study on counter insurgency under his directive and that “You have a memo from
                    me in your in-box no doubt on the subject.” So he looked in his box and said,
                    “Oh, yes, just give me a minute.”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I backed off and in about 5 minutes the President appeared and we had the 60
                    officers all standing around on the grass. General Taylor and Walt Rostow were
                    both there also. President Kennedy didn't have a single note in hand, but for
                    about 15 minutes he gave a brilliant presentation of how to counter insurgency,
                    showing that he was a quick learner with a most mobile mind. And also that he
                    knew what he wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ken, those are certainly some very fascinating
                        stories. You know, there's one thing you and I have in common. We both have
                        very charming wives that have each published a book. Your wife did a most
                        fascinating book Anna and the King of Siam in which she took the rather
                        stilted diary of Anna Leonowens, who was an English governess, and made a
                        fascinating story based on her years in Siam, her familiarity with the royal
                        family, and very intensive research subsequently. And my wife, on the other
                        hand, has written an interesting little book and illustrated and translated
                        an old manuscript by a French Sinologist published in Paris at the turn of
                        the century. The reason I mention this is that my wife was greatly aided and
                        helped by two members of the Cosmos Club for many years and then, when ____
                        returned to this country, became the head of the Oriental department of the
                        Library of Congress. He was most helpful to my wife in making the library
                        facilities available for her research and in encouraging her in her
                        endeavors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Also, Dr. John Alexander Pope, former director of the Freer Gallery of Art, was
                    very encouraging and allowed her to do considerable research in the library of
                    the Freer. Both of these gentlemen have been long-time members of the Cosmos
                    Club and also of the Literary Society of Washington, of which I believe your
                    wife has been a member for a long time. So you must be familiar with them and
                    their activities. Do you have any comments on them?</p>
                <p>LANDON: Yes. To begin with Dr. Hummel—we became very good friends when I first
                    arrived in Washington in August 1941 because, of course, I went directly to his
                    Oriental section at the Library of Congress. I wanted to find out what
                    documentation there was on southeast Asia. I found there were a few books on
                    Vietnam written in the classic Nom character system, a “Siamese twin” sort of
                    system using two characters side-by-side linked in the sense that one carried
                    the meaning and the other the sound, approximately, in Vietnamese. But there was
                    nothing really to amount to anything on Indochina except some of the
                    publications of the Ecole Fran�aise d'Extr�me Orient, a school of study located
                    at Hanoi.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>On Thailand, I found most of the Thai language publications lying in heaps on the
                    floor, unprocessed because they had no one to read and classify them. As for Dr.
                    Hummel, who first met me with casual interest, he became fascinated when he
                    discovered that I could speak fluently in the Swatow dialect of south China,
                    understood Fukienese dialect, and could manage in what I called schoolboy
                    Mandarin, which was somewhat like the French spoken in Indiana as taught by
                    teachers who had never been in France. Hummel was quite charmed by my interest
                    in Chinese and also that I was the book editor on Oriental matters for the
                    Journal of Philosophy published at Columbia University, when I held that post
                    beginning in about 1943 or 1944.</p>
                <p>I became quite an admirer of Dr. Hummel when I came to realize the magnitude of
                    his achievements at the Library, his acquisition of one of the most substantial
                    collections outside of China. He frequently twitted me that I had come to
                    Washington on southeast Asian affairs but that my really important interest, in
                    his view, was in Chinese matters.</p>
                <p>This interest of mine in Chinese and Japanese affairs, of course, brought me into
                    frequent contact with John Pope. So that he and I have been friends through the
                    years. I often discussed with him some of the philosophic publications I was
                    reviewing for the Journal of Philosophy because of his extensive knowledge and
                    profound understanding of Asian ways of thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ken, one of our mutual friends was Waldron Faulkner. And I
                        always remember a story he told me about the presidential guesthouse, Blair
                        House. It seems that when Waldron was a young man, a young architect just
                        starting here, he'd gotten a job in some architectural firm that was
                        remodeling Blair House to be used as an adjunct to the White House for
                        visiting dignitaries. Well, one of the things the architect said was
                        “Waldron the thing doesn't have any portico over the door. Would you do some
                        research? There must have been one.” Well, Waldron did a great deal of
                        research, and so far as he could find, from old photographs, there never was
                        a portico over the door. So he carefully designed one that he thought would
                        be correct. Just recently, before his death, he picked up a book on old and
                        famous houses in Washington, and here was a picture of the Blair House with
                        this magnificent old portico, which gave him a great deal of chuckles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LANDON: In connection with our famous wives, I might add a word more suggested by
                    Bill Atwood. Margaret had excellent writing ability in college and could even
                    write poetry, which she told me was only verse. This perplexed me as I didn't
                    understand poetry and couldn't understand how anybody could write it. In fact, I
                    viewed this ability with considerable awe. Her interest in writing was perhaps
                    stimulated again years later when she noticed that I was spending some of our
                    small income as missionaries in Siam on various publications of more political
                    and societal nature than missionary. She asked me why I was buying such books
                    and periodicals and ephemeral newspapers. And I said, “I'm going to write a book
                    on the 1932 revolution in Siam because I think it marked a turning point in Thai
                    history.”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>One day in 1929 or 1930, Margaret was visiting Dr. and Mrs. Edwin Bruce McDaniel,
                    who lived across the peninsula from us in Nakhon Si Thammarat, where we had
                    lived for a year after our one year in Bangkok language study. The doctor ran a
                    hospital and a leper home. One morning when he and Mrs. McDaniel were preparing
                    to go to work at the leper home he handed her a book, “The English Governess at
                    the Siamese Court.” He said he kept the book hidden behind other books in his
                    bookcase because the Siamese people didn't like it. They felt it was demeaning
                    to their king because it made him seem as a fallible human being and not the
                    divine incarnation of Siva they believed him to be.</p>
                <p>The book by Anna Leonowens was written in the Victorian style of the 1860s and
                    '70s and to many people would have been boring reading. But Margaret was carried
                    away into another century and world and hardly noticed the passage of time until
                    she had finished it.</p>
                <p>The next day Dr. McDaniel gave her a second book by Anna called “Romance of the
                    Harem.” These two books remained a vivid memory to Margaret when we returned to
                    the United States, and she determined to try to find copies and perhaps to write
                    an essay about Anna. We were in a Chicago bookstore where I was selecting books
                    on China for university studies when Margaret drifted into the out-of-print
                    fiction section and found a copy of the “English Governess” for $1.50 and could
                    hardly believe the price, as listings by English stores were in the neighborhood
                    of 5 pounds. And then at Marshall Fields a book sale was held and on a table she
                    found the “Harem” for 50 cents. So she felt she was on her way to writing an
                    essay about Anna.</p>
                <p>Our lives have had many strange coincidences and one occurred when I was
                    lecturing at Northwestern University to a clerical audience drawn from the
                    greater Chicago area. In the audience was an Episcopalian clergyman named Dean
                    Gerald C. Moore of the Evanston cathedral. He came up to me after the lecture
                    and said, “My mother would love to meet you. She had a very dear friend in Siam
                    named Anna - did you ever know her?”</p>
                <p>The foreign community at that time was small and I knew all Americans and many
                    British but no Anna, and so I said, “The only Anna I've ever heard of was Anna
                    Leonowens and I never met her; she was before my time.” And Dean Moore said,
                    “That's the Anna!” I did some mental arithmetic and I figured that his mother
                    would have to be about 100 years old to have known Anna Leonowens and so I said,
                    “It would have been nice to have met your mother.” He got the point and laughed
                    and said, “Mother lives only four or five blocks from here and she'd love to see
                    you!”</p>
                <p>So we went to see his mother, who proved to be 93 years old. Her mind was as
                    lively as that of a young woman and she had many vivid memories of Anna dating
                    from 1867. I asked if I might bring Margaret to meet her, saying that Margaret
                    was writing an essay on Anna and would appreciate her clear memories of Anna as
                    a living person. So Margaret and I returned shortly for a very happy tea
                    conversation.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>And then a few months later we received an invitation to call again on the Moores
                    to meet Miss Avis Fyshek, youngest granddaughter of Anna Leonowens, who came
                    from Toronto for the only time in her life to visit the Moores. At that meeting
                    they kept returning to the idea of Margaret's essay on Anna, which had actually
                    not yet gotten underway except in sketch form in Margaret's mind and perhaps a
                    little on paper. And they asked me repeatedly what I was writing and more about
                    my book that was shortly to be published by the University of Chicago Press and
                    Oxford Press on the 1932 revolution in Siam, called Siam in Transition.</p>
                <p>The upshot of all this conversation was that Avis Fyshek told how she had tried
                    to write the story of her grandmother and had almost 300 pages written before
                    she realized that she didn't know enough about Siam to write it. Later she came
                    out to Wheaton, Illinois, where we were living, and brought with her a file of
                    her own attempted biography, as well as a box crammed with letters from Anna
                    Leonowens to the family members plus some holograph letters from King Mongkut to
                    Anna, which no one outside of the family knew existed. She then proposed that
                    Margaret and I collaborate on a book about her grandmother if we were interested
                    and willing. I said that that was more Margaret's line of writing than mine but
                    that I would help in a support role in any way that might seem useful. Margaret
                    and I both knew that a writer can't write with someone looking over the writer's
                    shoulder with authority to modify, revise, or delete, and Margaret so informed
                    Avis Fyshek. Fyshek not only turned over what materials she had but also
                    graciously provided Margaret with a letter giving her a free hand. Also, she
                    collected and sent further family material.</p>
                <p>Then in August 1941, I came to Washington and discovered a mass of Siamese
                    language pamphlets and books in paper cover in Dr. Hummell's section of the
                    Library of Congress- -most of them lying un-shelved at the end of a corridor.
                    These items provided extensive documentation in the Siamese language of the
                    period when Anna was in Siam. And by that time I had said many times to
                    Margaret, “You've got a book, not an essay.” There were four more years of
                    research including materials at the National Archives. At any rate, by a chance
                    meeting at Northwestern University, Margaret was introduced to the subject of
                    her most famous book which in the 1980s is still being memorialized on stage by
                    Yul Brynner in “The King and I,” to large audiences.</p>

                <p>Waldron Faulkner and I became acquainted at the Literary Society where Margaret
                    was the member, not I. And I always enjoyed being the consort. Waldron and I
                    seemed to strike it off from the first. We got into the habit of having luncheon
                    together at the Club about once a month. This went on for years. And as both
                    Margaret and I became very fond also of Waldron's wife, Bussie, we met now and
                    then for dinner or some other event. I frequently discussed with Waldron some of
                    the architectural things that I had observed while taking pictures in Asia. One
                    of the puzzles was why the arch was never developed at Angkor Wat. Why was it
                    they could use those tremendous stones that would gradually inch toward each
                    other at the peak and be held there in suspension, but they never developed the
                    arch. Waldron went into that question at some length but never found any good
                    answer. I have a copy of his book on “Color in Architecture” as we also
                    discussed color in Asian architecture shown in some of my pictures. Sitting here
                    with Bill Atwood, of course, I think frequently of his father. I admired the
                    many articles he wrote and in fact pulled out many old ones for rereading after
                    we became acquainted at the Club. He always did the most meticulous research and
                    his writing was delightful. We loved to hear him talk about any subject that was
                    of interest to him because he had a way with words. I was especially charmed one
                    day when he told me he had enjoyed a couple of my short stories that had
                    appeared in the Saturday Evening Post while Ben Hibbs was still the editor.</p>
