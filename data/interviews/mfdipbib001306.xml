                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is June 10, 1992 and this is an interview with
                        Robert W. Zimmermann being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wonder if you could give a bit about your background...where you were born,
                    educated, and that type of thing?</p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I was born in Chicago and we moved to Minneapolis when I was about
                    ten years old. So I really grew up in Minneapolis finishing grade school there
                    and senior high. I went to the University of Minnesota with a major in economics
                    and political science. From there I went to Harvard Business School and
                    graduated from there in 1942. It was the last full class they ran before the
                    war. From then on until after the war it was special management courses.</p>
                <p>Obviously Pearl Harbor took place during that second year. The Navy was very much
                    on the ball and sent the commandant of the First Naval District out to the
                    Harvard Business School the next day, on Monday. An assembly was called and he
                    asked all those who were already committed to ROTC to leave and offered the rest
                    of us instant commissions and the promise that we would all be permitted to
                    graduate. It sounded like a very good deal so most of us did sign up...no boot
                    camp, nothing. I spent about 4 and a quarter years in the Navy.</p>
                <p>Earlier, however, I had been interested in the Foreign Service and consulted with
                    the faculty adviser at the University of Minnesota in 1935 or 1936. His advice
                    was that unless you had private means to forget it. They weren't taking many
                    people at that point and salaries were very poor. His suggestion was to go into
                    international business and then decide whether I wanted to transfer later. So
                    that was one reason why I went on to Harvard Business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How had you heard about the Foreign Service back in 1935?
                        What had sparked your interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I have no idea. They asked me that on the oral exams. I can only say
                    that I was an avid reader of the National Geographic and things like that. I
                    always had an interest in things relating to foreign matters.</p>
                <p>Coming out of the war in 1946, there were still limitations on entering, and I
                    decided that I had better try it. Meanwhile, I went back to Minneapolis after
                    getting out of the Navy and started law school at the University of Minnesota
                    waiting for the results of the exam to come in. I finished two semesters there
                    and enjoyed it thoroughly and was a little sorry to leave. But I had passed the
                    exams and decided to give it a try. And that is where I have been ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>I might add that between the two years at Harvard Business we were supposed to
                    work in a private company and write a report on it. That was required. I didn't
                    see where I was going to make much progress punching an adding machine in a
                    McCormick Shipping office somewhere. I had already taken a fair amount of
                    Spanish so I asked whether I might be permitted to go down to the University of
                    Mexico for that summer. They said it was fine but I would still have to write a
                    report. So I said I would write a report on doing business in Mexico.</p>
                <p>I took business courses, the professor didn't come half the time so I didn't come
                    much of the other half. I got the text books, went home and wrote the report.
                    They decided they liked it so much that they published it in the Harvard
                    Business Review.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during the Navy, did you get involved with
                        international affairs at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: No, not at all. We went up to Dartmouth for preliminary courses in
                    navigation and things like that, which I never used. I was pulled out of that
                    early and sent down to the Navy Yard for ordnance training ...everything from a
                    pistol to a 16 inch rifle. I was pulled out of that early with another Harvard
                    Business School graduate to set up production and inventory controls at the
                    Naval Magazine at Bellevue, which was between Naval Research and Bowling Field.
                    I elicited from the Commandant the agreement that I would be allowed to go to
                    sea in six months. Everyone was very patriotic in those days. He said, “Oh yeah,
                    fine, if everything is doing well.” So I put in for a transfer. After five
                    months we had the thing going. In fact it was the only fuse loading plant the
                    Navy had except for a small one up in Connecticut and a big one down in Macon,
                    Georgia.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I heard nothing for about two months so I asked him if I could go up to the Navy
                    Yard. He said, “Sure, take the official car.” It took me exactly twenty minutes
                    to find out what happened to my petition. He had called up a friend and asked
                    him to pigeon holed the transfer request. I got back madder than a hornet and
                    since I wasn't going to make the Navy a career, I accused him to his face of not
                    living up to his word. He was a wild Irishman. He lifted up the desk on one side
                    and slammed it down again and said, “Get out.” From then on we were great
                    buddies, we knew where each of us stood. For the rest of the war I never got
                    out. With each new Commandant I put in a request for transfer. I even
                    volunteered for submarine duty. That is how desperate I was.</p>
                <p>Finally I decided to relax and enjoy Washington. I met my wife here. Her father
                    was number two in the Cuban Embassy. We were married in Ottawa shortly after I
                    was out of the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the Foreign Service in 1947. Did you have a
                        beginning officer class and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: It was the usual 101 beginning officer class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give an impression of what your class was like?
                        What was its outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Gosh, I don't have any clear impression of that. We were just a group
                    of people pretty eager to get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose most were veterans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, most of them, if not all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Lima, Peru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1947-50.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you worked on Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: My Spanish wasn't bad. After all, my wife was Spanish speaking. I had
                    taken Spanish at university and later at the University of Mexico.</p>
                <p>We were doing a lot of rotation in those days, and I started out in the political
                    section. Then the inspectors came through and they said it was time to go down
                    to the consular section, so I did. By the same token, I asked for economic work
                    at the next post and that is why I got Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Lima, from your vantage point, what was the political
                        situation in Lima when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: It was reasonably quiet at first. Bustamante was president at the
                    time. It was, as it is today, a country of extreme financial wealth and extreme
                    poverty. The capital, itself, was surrounded by poor little settlements and
                    thrown together shacks and that sort of thing by the Indians who came down from
                    the Andes, many of whom, incidentally, quickly developed TB because of the large
                    lungs they developed in the Andes. When they came down those lungs weren't used
                    to capacity and TB quickly developed.</p>
                <p>That began to change as the APRA party increasingly pushed for power with Haya de
                    la Torre at the head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This party was the A... how do you spell it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: APRA. It was much more to the left at that time then it is today.</p>
                <p>While I was there we had the first revolt by the APRA party which succeeded in
                    getting the support of a small part of the military. It was probably one of the
                    few battles between cruisers and tanks. The cruisers didn't have enough fuel
                    except to circle around in the middle of the harbor at Callao and the tanks were
                    shooting at them and vice versa.</p>
                <p>That revolt was unsuccessful but it was the occasion for Haya de la Torre to seek
                    asylum in the Colombian Embassy where he remained for somewhere around seven
                    years before the Peruvian government allowed him to leave.</p>
                <p>Then things continued to be rather quiet until the Odria revolt which began at
                    Arequipa, where all successful coups up to that time began. General Odria was
                    successful and they threw out Bustamante.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when you were still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, we were still there.</p>
                <p>Odria took over with a military government, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy react to this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: By that time I was in the consular section. I don't recall being too
                    privy to what was going on. We did have staff meetings, but not very often. We
                    had a very strange ambassador. He used to call a staff meeting and put a huge
                    melon on his desk and tell us to look at it and just imagine what this country
                    can really do when it tries, and that was the end of the staff meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Prentice Cooper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: This is Prentice Cooper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a political ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, from the “Boss” Crump machines in Memphis. He was quite a
                    character. In fact articles used to appear about him in the New York Times and
                    Time magazine and these would be surreptitiously circulated around the entire
                    Embassy. I must say that the esprit de corps in that Embassy, because of him,
                    and the feeling against him, was the highest I have ever seen any where.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that he just wasn't doing anything or was he
                        getting involved in the wrong things or taking wrong turns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, he loved to be pictured in the press with opposition leader
                    Haya de la Torre before he pulled the revolution. In fact he used to call in the
                    PAO and ream him out in his office every morning if there wasn't a picture of
                    him on the front page of the local newspapers. Some people have said that if he
                    had just gone home after the major earthquake, that happened before I got there,
                    when he went in on mules with blankets, etc., he would have been great, but he
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>After that we had Harold Tittmann who was a real prince.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a professional officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were down in the consular section, not
                        exactly pulling the strings of policy, but did you get any feeling for what
                        were our American interests there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: My feeling at that time was that we were trying to make headway with
                    the Peruvian military, which had not been all that friendly during World War
                    II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always think of them with their German helmet and goose
                        step and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Exactly. We had some very large military offices and missions down
                    there working with the Peruvian military. We were also concerned, but not as
                    concerned as we would be today, with the differences in income. To illustrate,
                    at one point my wife and I were traveling in the north of Peru. We had been
                    invited to spend the night at a very large sugar plantation that was owned by
                    the extremely wealthy Gildermiester family. It was run by a young relative. I
                    don't know if he was a son, nephew or grandson. He was a very accomplished
                    violinist, very good looking, tall. He took us around, and the peasants would
                    come and kneel in front of him. He had jackboots on and carried a long whip...we
                    never saw him whip the people, but used it on the ground next to them. It was
                    that sort of thing, not very pleasant to behold. So you did have those
                    extremes.</p>
                <p>We were also interested in preserving U.S. mining interests. The U.S. had major
                    investments up at Cerro de Pasco which were sometimes a bone of contention with
                    the Peruvian government and people.</p>
                <p>We also did fishing off the coast, but that was long before the 200 mile argument
                    started.</p>
                <p>I can't think of anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you say you made your application to get some
                        economic training and they whipped you all the way over to Bangkok. You were
                        there from 1950-52.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation as you saw it in Thailand at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, it was recovering from Japanese occupation. A bridge had just
                    been reconstructed across the river. They were trying to pull themselves
                    together. That was the main thing. We had people working with them on rice
                    culture, trying to improve the dry land rice, developing hydroelectric power and
                    establishing a reliable electricity supply. Also we were trying to reestablish
                    American influence in Southeast Asia. This was the one country in the area that
                    had never been a colony of anybody else. It was a great place to be working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing as an economic officer there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I was doing some financial reporting and worried about radio
                    communications...we had special permits from the Thai government that I was
                    responsible for keeping up and getting renewed. Beyond that, it was mainly trade
                    and commerce more than anything else, and running end-use checks to prevent
                    diversion of goods to communist users.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we basically trying to find markets for Thai goods,
                        or were we trying to find markets for American goods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: We were trying to find markets for American goods. We weren't too
                    much worried about Thai exports. Tourism was growing, but was not all that great
                    at that point. Jim Thompson was developing his famous Thai silk. We knew Jim
                    very well.</p>
                <p>Road construction was another project of the ICA (International Communications
                    Agency) mission. Paved roads didn't lead very far out of Bangkok in those days.
                    They hadn't started filling in the canals yet. They complain about traffic
                    today, but I think it was just as bad then, there were fewer roads. You had more
                    of the foot pedal three wheel vehicles (samlor).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Thai officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I found them very pleasant to deal with. I worked largely with the
                    head of the commercial section in the Foreign Office, Thanat Khoman, who later
                    became prime minister. He was also ambassador here in Washington. A very able
                    and shrewd man who was most pleasant. He was open and frank, and my principal
                    contact, although there were others.</p>
                <p>We had a big AID program there. In fact, another man at the Embassy and I went up
                    on an expedition in the north while the AID people were trying to find a site
                    for a dam. This was a famous trip down the Mai Ping River on the Burmese border,
                    stopping now and then to take rock samples. We had armed guards along because
                    there was a lot of banditry along there. It was a fabulous trip, a classic one
                    that nobody does anymore. It is too difficult to arrange.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the impact of the Korean War which started in
                        June 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN:Aside from the increased general insecurity in the area, I don't
                    remember it having a great deal of an impact on the general public at that
                    point. We felt much more the impact of events in Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam.
                    There was a great deal of banditry and roving armed bands during that period. We
                    didn't have Dien Bien Phu until later, but it was still very difficult. The
                    Ambassador refused to allow anybody to go to Angkor Wat because the last time
                    the plane had been shot up on landing and the previous time a bus going from the
                    airport in Siem Reap was shot up. Things finally relaxed somewhat and Jerry
                    Stricker and I drove over on our own with the Ambassador's permission. But we
                    were about the first ones from the Embassy allowed for some time. However, we
                    were not allowed to go outside of the central complex of Angkor without
                    permission of the Cambodian government and a military escort.</p>
                <p>It was an unstable and uncertain period. Saigon, however was more directly
                    involved. My wife went over on one of the military planes that went over to
                    Saigon for R&amp;R. They had luncheon with the other friends who had gone and
                    the day after a bomb was thrown into that same restaurant. Those things were
                    going on. We were concerned in Bangkok and followed the events, but were not in
                    the middle of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about China? Was the Embassy spending a lot of time
                        looking at developments in China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes. We had one officer, Jerry Stricker, who worried mostly about
                    China and Ed Stanton, the Ambassador, was an old China hand. Between them they
                    did most of the Chinese reporting. Of particular interest was the large Chinese
                    population in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel from talking to Stricker or from
                        ambassador staff meetings about what they felt the impact of China on
                        Thailand might be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The Thais were always concerned about Chinese efforts to increase
                    their influence and were very careful. This was nothing new; it is what they had
                    been doing their entire history. However, I don't recall any instance of serious
                    problems with the Chinese community in Thailand in that period. But they kept a
                    very close eye on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Edwin Stanton as Ambassador. What was his style of
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: He was low key, very knowledgeable, demanding, of course, but in a
                    very pleasant way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You felt you were under a competent ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Oh, absolutely. No question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You sort of tasted different areas, your next post was to
                        London where you served from 1953-56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I might add on the Bangkok side that again there was a revolution.
                    This was the one in which they sought to throw Pibul Songgram, the Prime
                    Minister, out. It was on the occasion of AID delivering a dredge to the Thai
                    government. The dredge was destined to keep the channel deep enough for larger
                    vessels to come up the river. It was a big occasion with priests chanting, etc.
                    The diplomatic corps was lined up on one side. The Prime Minister had gone
                    aboard to inspect the dredge along with the head of AID and the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>They were followed two minutes later by a detachment of marines who “arrested”
                    the Prime Minister and requested the head of AID and our Ambassador to leave. We
                    were all told to disperse. I was with Rolland Bushner. As we were going back to
                    our car a marine came over and shoved a machine gun in our stomachs. We were
                    told we could not go that way. We did not feel like arguing.</p>
                <p>The city was full of shooting through the next day. Our house was hit about
                    fifteen times by bullets...both strafing aircraft and marines coming up through
                    the rice patties across the main highway. We were in the downstairs “john” with
                    the kids so we would have more walls between us and the shooting. It was a
                    pretty sticky time. We were told to stay home and not try to get to the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>We immediately met at the Embassy after the ceremony to discuss our observations
                    of the takeover and then were instructed to go home and not move until called.
                    The phone worked most the time, curiously, I recall. But by the following
                    evening we were able to move around town to see what the damage was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general attitude towards this
                        revolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: It is hard to say what the people really thought about it. This was a
                    naval marine operation. They had Pibul as a prisoner on board a naval vessel in
                    the middle of the river, but finally let him off as revolutionary support
                    diminished. I didn't get any particular feeling from the people, from our
                    servants or anyone else. It seemed to be viewed as one of those things the
                    military did from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about as far as the Embassy was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, I think the Embassy didn't want a lot of changes. We were
                    getting along very well with the current officials in terms of our operations,
                    desires and commercial and political relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a change as far as your work
                        was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: No, Pibul came back into power. It only lasted for a few days. There
                    wasn't any basic change while we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then what were you doing in this London
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: In London I worked on the South Asia/Far East desk. The Embassy was
                    set up, as you know, like a small State Department with a South Asia/Far East
                    section, a Near East section, Latin America...which I picked up because nobody
                    else spoke Spanish and I was interested in keeping a hand in... and there were
                    divisions for internal political reporting as well. I was the junior officer and
                    the number two to Art Ringwalt, who was an old China hand. We covered everything
                    from Afghanistan on.</p>
                <p>Much time was consumed by liaison with the Foreign Office. I would say three or
                    four days out of five I would be at the Foreign Office for part of the day,
                    talking with desk people and being permitted to read some of their despatches,
                    coming back and reporting to Washington.</p>
                <p>The Korean War was in full bloom and Dien Bien Phu, I believe, took place during
                    that time. It was a very busy time. We were especially worried about several
                    Americans being held by the Chinese Communists. We were working through the
                    British trying to get them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British had relations with the Chinese and we
                        didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: One interesting little vignette. While I was in London I had a bad
                    case of sciatica and the doctor ordered me to get out of the dampness for a
                    couple of weeks. I went to Italy. One evening, I was walking around Venice just
                    looking at book stores. There was one filled with a lot of communist books.
                    Suddenly I heard behind me American voices commenting on the books. I turned
                    around because something they had said had indicated they had just come out of
                    China. The two were priests we had very recently succeeded in getting out. I
                    introduced myself, noting that I had been working in London on their case
                    through the British. We knew they had left, but here they were in Venice.</p>
                <p>I also asked for and did Latin America liaison. Part of this was during the time
                    of Arbenz in Guatemala. I was very good friends, from earlier days in Lima, of
                    the Guatemalan Ambassador who confided in me a number of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about Arbenz. This was the CIA's one major coup.
                        He was a leftist who was gotten rid of certainly with American intelligence
                        assistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: So I have heard. I think Ambassador Peurifoy wrote a great deal about
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you would talk to the British on this. What was
                        the reaction there to this kind of action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: You mean the British reaction, the official British Foreign Office
                    reaction? For one thing it is not their primary sphere of influence so they
                    generally followed our lead. But I think they thought we always meddled too much
                    and just didn't let things take their course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the British Foreign Office people. Did our two
                        foreign services mesh well as far as working together at this particular
                        period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Oh, I think we had very good relations with them and with the
                    Colonial Office as well. We had excellent relations. Ringwalt was operating on a
                    somewhat higher level than I did, but we were both down there all the time and
                    always seemed welcome. The same was true in the Near East. Joe Palmer was doing
                    the Near East when we got there and then Evan Wilson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any points of conflict between the British and
                        United States that you were aware of in East Asian problems?</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, there was always the argument of recognition of China. But it
                    was done on rather an intellectual plane. There were problems, obviously, that
                    developed around people like Krishna Menon, as well there might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Krishna Menon was Minister of Defense of India and loved
                        to stick needles into the Americans and was intensely disliked by most
                        anybody who dealt with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I well remember going with Art Ringwalt to a lecture one evening in
                    London on something about South Asia. Krishna Menon was there. He walked right
                    over to me and started talking to me in a very friendly fashion. It quickly
                    turned out that he thought I was the new Minister from Lebanon! As soon as he
                    found out I was from the US, he abruptly walked off.</p>
                <p>I think all those discussions with the British were on an intellectual basis, I
                    don't recall any sort of real...well, problems that stemmed from those
                    differences, yes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The British recognized China and we didn't and for many
                        years this was a major policy decision on our part. At the time did you get
                        any feel that the British were getting a lot more out of having recognized
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: No, I didn't. And I don't think the British thought so either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I gather was that it really didn't make much
                        difference. China was going to do their own thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, that is the impression I had. If I remember right, I think some
                    of the British were privately saying, “Well, what good did it do us?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They almost had to let it run its course, which took about
                        30 years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: They had made their move, we made ours and it didn't make much
                    difference in the end. However, it did give us a channel to talk to the Chinese
                    in terms of those Americans who were incarcerated. But that might have been done
                    through some other country, too, if the British hadn't been able to assist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much feedback from the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Not a whole lot of feedback. Obviously we got into the annual thing
                    about agendas at the UN and all that. Those were largely instructions and we
                    discussed them with the British. But not much feedback. It was largely reporting
                    on our side of what the British told us. That was the basic thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador there was Winthrop Aldrich and I know it
                        was a huge organization there, but did you get any feel of how he operated
                        and was evaluated by those who worked for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: My impression was that everybody looked to the DCM more than to
                    Aldrich. The DCM was really running the operation. He ran the staff meetings and
                    everything else. Aldrich was seldom there. The DCM at first was Julius Holmes
                    and then Walt Butterworth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had two very competent professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Absolutely, and everybody looked directly to them. I just had no real
                    personal feeling about Aldrich and I don't think many did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left London in 1956 and went back to the State
                        Department where you served for three years, to 1959. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: My first assignment on paper was to go to New Guinea. I wasn't too
                    happy because we had three small children at that point and the post report said
                    the bubonic plague hadn't occurred for the last two years or something like
                    that. I didn't object, in those days you didn't object. But Walt Butterworth,
                    the DCM, did. He said that was not the assignment for me. I don't know all the
                    details but I know he did talk to Walter Robertson, who was Assistant Secretary
                    for the Far East, about it and the end result was that the assignment was
                    changed and I went back as special assistant for SEATO affairs.</p>
                <p>I was under Ken Young in the Southeast Asia Office as the first guy worrying
                    full-time about SEATO. Then George Abbott came in as a senior special assistant.
                    When George left I became the special assistant for SEATO affairs before going
                    to the War College.</p>
                <p>It was a frustrating job in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say SEATO was sort of one of those treaties
                        that was there but nobody could quite figure out what it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Nobody wanted to put any flesh on it that amounted to anything. They
                    wanted to do a lot of talking about it, and we certainly did, but there wasn't
                    much to back it up. Eventually it ended up with a big headquarters in Bangkok. I
                    suspect it may have served some real psychological purpose, but to what extent,
                    it is difficult to say. We spent a good deal of time trying to set up
                    connections with CENTO, which never really got very far off the ground
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time how did you view some of the members? I am
                        thinking about Philippines, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the UK,
                        Pakistan, France. Who were sort of the strong supporters and who were the
                        weak sisters in all of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: At that time, the Philippines was a very strong supporter. The Thai
                    liked it, but I am not sure how much skepticism was behind all that. I think the
                    Philippines thought more of its possibilities. Of course ANZUS was there anyway,
                    as far as Australia and New Zealand were concerned. Pakistan was sort of
                    standoffish about it as soon as it found out it didn't mean big bucks, and in
                    any case it also had CENTO.</p>
                <p>Baghdad pulled out of the Baghdad Pact after a while and it became CENTO. That
                    connection with SEATO never really got very far. At that point it was
                    interesting because Hermann Eilts was doing the Baghdad Pact while I was doing
                    SEATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Supposedly the link was Pakistan wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when they were forming SEATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: No, I came afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because there is a lot of controversy over who put
                        Pakistan into SEATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I can't comment on that. I really don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling about the support of Secretary Dulles
                        toward SEATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: One had the feeling that this was something that he looked at very
                    carefully once a year at the annual meeting of Foreign Ministers. That may be a
                    little unfair. We did do some intelligence exchanges through SEATO but I don't
                    think any of them were things that couldn't have been done otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel a little bit out in left field as far as
                        Southeast Asian affairs was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, I think so. It was a good observation point to know what was
                    going on all throughout that area. But I did have the feeling that I was out of
                    the mainstream of events.</p>
                <p>You were asking about support. I think the British were pretty good about backing
                    us up on this. I think it was one of those things: “Well, the Americans want it,
                    fine, we will support it and maybe it isn't all that bad of an idea.” That sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French role? The French had already pulled
                        out of Vietnam. I can't think of any territory they had around there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: They still maintained a very strong interest in Laos and Cambodia.
                    Maybe they pulled out but they still tried to maintain influence and were very
                    jealous of any attempts we made to increase our influence in the area. I frankly
                    don't remember much on the French side, either plus or minus re SEATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment was to the War College for a year.
                        How did you find the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I found it a great way to get to know the military better. Of course
                    most of us had served in the military, but even so, these were eager, upcoming
                    officers, intelligent guys and very interesting. As far as the subject matter I
                    am not sure there was a great deal added by the War College. It was suggested
                    that we were there largely to provide a balancing civilian viewpoint and
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again and again I have heard this phrase that essentially
                        we were put in there really for them to draw on us. Also it was a generation
                        thing because most of us who came in up through the early sixties, a good
                        number of us had served our time in the military. Whereas the military had
                        very little contact with the State side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I am not saying it was a bad thing, just stating that we seemed to be
                    there for that purpose rather than learning things ourselves. Although we
                    obviously did in terms of military organization and military outlook, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went from the War College to a good solid stint
                        in Madrid. What were you doing in Madrid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I was the deputy chief of the political section when I went. Later I
                    became political counselor. We were there for many years, probably too many, but
                    we were hardly going to object. We found it very interesting. My wife,
                    particularly, having been Cuban, her grandfather having been born in Spain,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation? You came in 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The construction of the bases had just been finished a few years
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were American bases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Torrejon, Zaragoza and Moron. Rota was there, but had not become a
                    major installation yet. We didn't have the nukes coming in, that came later.</p>
                <p>It was always the constant question of keeping in touch with the opposition as
                    much as you could without annoying the Franco government too much, combined with
                    attempts to push in subtle ways the government to more openness. It was a period
                    of considerable economic aid and military aid to the extent that a lot of
                    Spanish opposition became annoyed at the extent of military aid. They thought it
                    supported Franco's continuing rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about the opposition. What was the situation? Was
                        there an opposition within the governmental structure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The government structure wasn't monolithic. There were degrees of
                    support for Franco.</p>
                <p>Let me say something about at least one opposition leader, not an important one
                    but one who made this comment that reflected the feelings of a wide spectrum:
                    “We don't like Franco, but if the transition can be carried out in a peaceful
                    manner, it will have been worth all the years under Franco.”</p>
                <p>There were many people who thought that. But more rabid opposition wanted Franco
                    out, period. They thought all our economic and military aid did nothing but
                    support the regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>A lot of this led to ambivalent attitudes toward Spain by the rest of the world.
                    The Spanish regime was still sort of a pariah in parts of Europe, especially to
                    the labor parties in Scandinavia, Italy, England and France.</p>
                <p>But I think the US opening, obviously done to obtain the bases, did in the end
                    wear down some of this opposition, soften it. Spain did not fully become an
                    accepted member of Western Europe until many years later when Spain finally
                    became a member of NATO. That wasn't until well after Franco disappeared in the
                    fall of 1975.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting period. We had contacts not only with the opposition,
                    but also with some of the ultra supporters of the Falange.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could you characterize the people you were meeting?
                        Were these really hard-nose fascist types?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Some of them, yes. That type of person with very few exceptions was
                    probably in second and third echelon positions, not in top positions. Many of
                    the top cabinet officers, obviously, were supporters of Franco or they wouldn't
                    have been there. But they tended to be quite able people, some of them basically
                    technicians more than politicians or political advocates of one side or another.
                    People like Lopez Rodo who was basically a technician, a very fine economist. He
                    did a lot for Spain, bringing it out of the economic basement.</p>
                <p>This was a period when Spain was changing very rapidly. I remember early in the
                    first year (1960) taking drives outside on a Sunday with the kids around Madrid
                    and you didn't have to go very far to see people still cultivating the fields
                    with Roman ploughs. Two years later there were tractors everywhere unless you
                    were way off in the hinterland. By the end of my tour it was hard to find a
                    Roman plough except at an antique shop. It was a period of great changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could our policy be summed up in one word, bases, as far
                        as Spain was concerned, or were there other considerations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, the bases go back to strategic problems with Russia, obviously.
                    That was the name of the game. I think the only reason we were concerned about
                    bringing Spain back into the Western community, so to speak, was for that
                    reason...to keep Spain on our side. There was concern about Spain's orientation.
                    There was a saying that Africa begins at the Pyrenees, not at the Mediterranean.
                    There was concern that Spain really wasn't going to be a partner of the Western
                    coalition.</p>
                <p>I think that overshadowed any other consideration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling for what you were getting from
                        our cousins about where they stood? Communist parties by this time were
                        beginning to develop distinct characteristics. The French was a real tool of
                        the Soviet Union. The Italians were sort of going their own way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The Spanish Communist Party was pretty well decimated by the Franco
                    machine. They were there, yes, but they were not a big noise. They worked
                    largely on the labor side and some of the Socialist parts of the labor movement
                    tended to be more communist than socialist. You also had a lot of returning
                    exiles from Russia at that point that were being subjected to an interrogation
                    program.</p>
                <p>I would say that more noise came from the Basque Separatists, that sort of thing,
                    and the Catalan separatists, who really had nothing to do with the
                    Communists.</p>
                <p>Just as an aside, one person described the difference between the Basque and the
                    Catalan movements: “Catalan separatism is an intellectual thing; the Basque
                    movement is emotional. Therefore the Catalan will never carry it through,
                    because they know they are too tied to the Spanish economy.” Barcelona up to
                    that point had been much more of an industrial center than Madrid...certainly as
                    a banking, publishing and textile center. But that has somewhat changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the political section? Was there a
                        problem of getting sort of smothered and coopted by the wealthy upper
                        class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: There was always that problem and that was an accusation that was
                    leveled against Ambassador Lodge, of course. That is not original with me. But
                    that really wasn't a problem down the line. The upper wealthy class were really
                    more interested in the Ambassador and DCM than anyone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was John Davis Lodge like? What was your impression
                        of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: At one point I wondered whether I could take a full tour. Lodge loved
                    to sing “Madrid” at every party; his conduct at staff meetings was imperious,
                    not really listening, trying to put people down. At that point he and the DCM
                    were not even talking to each other. I can't really remember very many
                    specifics. Anyway, he left six months after my arrival.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was replaced by Tony Biddle. What was he like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: He was an absolute prince. He had the ability to be friends with
                    everybody. He wasn't there very long, as you well know. He went home and died of
                    cancer. You may remember that the heads of the Spanish government at that time
                    moved up to San Sebastian every summer for two or three months. The Ambassador
                    rented a house there and we would rotate as assistants to him...one secretary
                    and one assistant. I was fortunate to have spent a month up there with him,
                    which was absolutely delightful.</p>
                <p>He was a great raconteur telling about his experiences with the exile governments
                    in London during the war and that sort of thing. His death was a great
                    shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was replaced by Bob Woodward. How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: A top pro. There was no question. He was extremely knowledgeable,
                    careful, exacting. Just excellent. There is no other way of putting it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having been an ambassador three times previously. Also he
                        had been Assistant Secretary for ARA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is right. It was a great pleasure to serve under him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After a while, you were there so long you had one more,
                        Angie Biddle Duke. How about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, he wouldn't let me out. He was a little like my old Naval
                    Commander. At this point I could see that I was spending too much time in
                    Madrid. I also had been fingered to be political counselor in Venezuela under
                    Bernbaum. Finally Bernbaum said he couldn't wait for Angie to release me so the
                    whole thing went up in the air. I finally came back to Washington with no
                    specific assignment and Joe Palmer took me on in the Director General's office
                    as assistant for presidential appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Presidential appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me a feel for this? You were there from
                        1966-69. This was high Johnson period. Just to get a feel for the goings on.
                        What type of operations were you involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, for one thing I had charge of a whole group of women GS's who
                    ran the Great Seal, titles and commissions, etc. They kept trying to increase
                    their staff saying they couldn't do all this work without five more people. I
                    had decided to cut back, not add. I couldn't see what they needed all those
                    people for. We finally did get the office down to a little more reasonable
                    size.</p>
                <p>The other thing was doing incessant lists of possible career people for
                    presidential appointments which then went through Joe Palmer and later John
                    Steeves, and up through Bill Crockett, Under Secretary for Administration, and
                    his successor, Idar Rimestad. I worked much more with Rimestad than Crockett.
                    This was a very frustrating period. I also worked a lot with George Springsteen,
                    who was in Ball's office. That is where I would pick up most of the rumors about
                    what really was going on in terms of candidates for various positions.</p>
                <p>I wrote papers why a particular career candidate would be good for a specific
                    post and then list alternates. One often had the feeling of “So what?” in the
                    end. It probably hasn't changed much today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have contact with the White House side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, we had, but that was very guarded, particularly on their
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time were you getting things from old hands? Was
                        the Johnson White House much different than the Kennedy White House or from
                        the Eisenhower White House on this matter, or was it pretty much business as
                        usual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Basically business as usual. But there was a different approach. The
                    Kennedy approach was very interesting. I don't know how much this was Kennedy or
                    some of his bushy tailed supporters who were really interested in the third
                    world and wanted to go there as ambassadors. I think it was the one time when we
                    had a lot of political appointees in emerging countries in Africa instead of
                    always in Western Europe, etc. In fact, at that point we were getting some
                    career people in Paris, etc.</p>
                <p>So from that point of view it was different, but the operation wasn't. It was
                    quite a frustrating assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume it was the matter of writing up the

                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is right, we worked largely with Senior Assignments. Then the
                    list would go to Steeves and finally to George Springsteen. I would get more
                    information from George Springsteen under Ball than I would get from most
                    anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ball was the Under Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: George and I had a very good relationship. We knew what we could tell
                    each other, I think. With John Steeves it became a little more difficult because
                    there was friction between Rimestad and John Steeves. I got along with them both
                    and at times found myself being in the bridge position, which isn't always very
                    nice. But I very much liked John Steeves, admired him in many ways, but he was
                    very different from Rimestad's go, go sort of position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would the Director General and Under Secretary for
                        Management get into a difference over who to send forward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I never knew exactly what those differences were, how they came
                    about. I never knew that. I think probably it stemmed largely from Steeves
                    trying to push career people and running into Rimestad's desire to meet
                    pressures from the White House and the Hill. I think John was trying to play the
                    career game and help out the Service as much as he could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went for a relatively short tour to Lisbon, as

                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That was largely a question of base negotiations...also keeping track
                    of the opposition. Salazar was still in power. He died while we were there.
                    Caetano came in with not much change in atmosphere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, physically. He was still there in that nobody did much without
                    getting a nod from him, even if it was a sick nod.</p>
                <p>But the name of the game was base negotiations.</p>

                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is the largest base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is the whole relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is right. Only in this case, of course, Portugal was a member of
                    NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about Portugal being a member of NATO? It
                        is hard to remember that Portugal is in NATO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: It was there, that is about it. It came in largely as the result of
                    the war time operations. It didn't add much to NATO except for bases, but that
                    was a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say bases, were their other bases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, it was basically Lajes, but we did have some separate Navy
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lajes is the one on the Azores?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, we had nothing really on the mainland. We did have, of course,
                    in Spain and Portugal, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which were
                    important. But the base negotiations had been thrown off track because of
                    problems with India and Goa and later with Angola and Mozambique. The Portuguese
                    felt we had failed to support them in the way they thought we should support
                    them as an ally. Never mind the fact that similar support was not coming from
                    the other allies either. The leverage was with the United States because we were
                    the ones wanting the base.</p>
                <p>Negotiations dragged on with no new formal agreement, just allowing the old
                    agreement to continue informally. We operated under that arrangement without any
                    formal extension for many years. In fact it wasn't until after the revolution in
                    1974 that there was a formal renewal of the agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the situation in Africa, you had Mozambique and
                        Angola...this is the time of decolonization...did you find yourself, the
                        proponents of the Portuguese and sort of fighting the proponents of
                        anti-colonialism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: There was no meeting of the minds with the Portuguese government,
                    whatsoever. I have done a certain amount of work on this recently so have been
                    reviewing a lot of the documents at State and my memory is fairly fresh on
                    this.</p>
                <p>We would say, “We are really on your side. We don't want you to get out tomorrow.
                    Voting on the future doesn't necessarily mean immediate independence.” This was
                    the line that we took with the Portuguese and I think quite honestly. We said,
                    “To preserve your position you are going to have to start along the line of
                    reform, both political and economic.” Their response was always, “Yes, yes, but
                    we are not ready yet.” And what little came from the Portuguese was always far
                    too late and far too little. It really upset relations very deeply for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would be sending in the Portuguese side and the
                        African Bureau would...I mean this battle of Africa has gone on for...first
                        with Algeria and France. Did you find yourself sort of carrying on what was
                        essentially a pretty unpopular policy elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, it was unpopular there, but it was our position, and there was
                    no question of disagreement with it. It wasn't just a question of following
                    orders, we all believed in it. To go back a little, Soapy Williams made one of
                    his famous trips to Africa while I was still in Madrid. He went down to Rio Muni
                    and Fernando Po, when they were still Spanish provinces. I was sent down to go
                    with him and monitor the visit. Nothing untoward really took place; it was a
                    good visit and no friction developed in either place. It was an interesting
                    experience. I had also been down with the military attach� to Ifni in the
                    Spanish Sahara, which was also fascinating because the Spanish Foreign Legion
                    was still in full flower. In fact I stood with the attach� taking the day-end
                    salute from the Foreign Legion! It was very moving in a way. You didn't believe
                    in what they were doing, but it was impressive.</p>
                <p>This gave me further background on Africa as on the War College trip. I chose the
                    African trip because at that time it was the one area I hadn't gotten near
                    before. Q: How about Kissinger and his influence with the policy at that time?
                    This was when he was National Security Adviser. I assume that he saw everything
                    in West verses East and when the chips were down this policy prevailed?</p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Oh yes, I think there was no doubt about that. I mean you could say
                    we were interested in economic development in Portugal, but the country had been
                    kept so under wraps by Salazar the Portuguese weren't even permitted to
                    participate in the jazz age. It was a very undeveloped country in many ways.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ridgway Knight was your ambassador. What was his method of
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, I will tell you one thing, he didn't need a DCM, which made
                    life difficult at times. It was one reason I was delighted to go on to Barcelona
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a matter of his doing all the operations of the
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is really more or less correct. There was no real division,
                    although I am not sure he would see it that way, but all I can do is note that
                    the inspector's that he did not need a DCM. When I left the position was
                    abolished for the time he was ambassador. He brought Diego Asencio up and
                    insisted on calling him the DCM, although the Department didn't recognize that
                    for a while. It was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been difficult to be left sort of dangling
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: He thought I wasn't doing anything and I had the feeling that every
                    time I was doing something, something else had already happened. It was that
                    sort of problem. I think there just wasn't enough for him to do. The main issue
                    was trying to renew the base agreements and that was a very slow operation.
                    There wasn't much on the plus side. Beyond that there wasn't really a whole
                    lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did your transfer to go to Barcelona come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The inspectors came through, I actually knew the chief inspector,
                    John Hill, who had been on the opposite end of the line on SEATO affairs in
                    Bangkok when I was in Washington. John Hill recognized the situation and
                    suggested I request a change of assignment. The Consulate General in Barcelona
                    was not an ideal place to go, but it suddenly came open and they were looking
                    for somebody urgently. We loved Spain and certainly knew Spain after six years
                    there. I think Macomber wanted a consular officer in there, but eventually I
                    went over to Madrid and talked to Bob Hill and he said, “Yes, I do want you up
                    there.” It was a very enjoyable four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Consul General in Barcelona from 1970-74. What
                        was the situation in Barcelona? How different was it from Madrid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, let's remember that this is the end of the Franco regime.
                    Franco died just a little over a year after we left. One of my ambitions in
                    Spain was to be there when that transition took place, having spent that much
                    time in Spain. But I never succeeded.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The situation was that the conditions had loosened considerably, certainly
                    economically, and even to some extent, politically. It had been a gradual thing
                    over the years. There were still hardliners, Franco supporters, in Barcelona,
                    but they were not as evident as they were at an earlier period in Barcelona. The
                    Catalan Separatists were still noticeable. This was an intellectual thing more
                    than a strong emotional thing. There were a few evidences of physical violence
                    once in a while, but not like in the Basque area.</p>
                <p>The US was quite welcome, I think, always. The Sixth Fleet was in there all the
                    time. There were the usual relatively minor problems with the Sixth Fleet when
                    all the sailors came ashore. But on the whole they were welcomed.</p>
                <p>It was a period, perhaps, of declining importance for Catalonia economically. A
                    lot of their industry, textiles specifically, had become very antiquated and
                    needed a great deal of modernization...I am not sure it has ever taken place.
                    Publishing was going very well. It was one of the great publishing centers of
                    the Latin speaking world.</p>
                <p>The people were rather different, I think. And we were in a good position to
                    observe because, after all, we had had six years in Madrid and then many
                    connections and friends in Catalonia.</p>
                <p>One small example of a difference. People at a large cocktail party in Madrid
                    would say, “Oh, you must come out to our finca for the weekend. We will be in
                    touch.” You never hear from them again. In Catalonia they call the next day and
                    say, “When is it convenient to come out.” They really want you. There is a great
                    difference in approach there. Both of them were very friendly and very nice.
                    Perhaps it was a little harder with our background in Madrid to get to know the
                    Catalans well, but once we did they were very good and very loyal friends. My
                    wife goes back now and some of those friends continue to pick her up at the
                    airport. My oldest son married a girl from Barcelona although it wasn't until
                    after we were back here.</p>
                <p>It was also interesting, and perhaps untypical from a Consul General's point of
                    view that successive ambassadors in Madrid, I believe, recognized my long
                    experience in Spain. Therefore I had a relatively free hand in my methods of
                    operation in Barcelona. I was very careful to keep them informed, of course, of
                    everything that was going on.</p>
                <p>There was a very active binational center in Barcelona which was very useful. But
                    also, the Sixth Fleet was a great tool because it brought in a great show band
                    which at that point was at its zenith under Admiral Miller which led to an
                    interesting incident, if you are interested. It also was a great forum for
                    entertaining all the provincial governors and military governors in my district.
                    When a Fleet carrier was in, it would go out in the Mediterranean and mount
                    exercises to which we could invite the officials. We would invite the Ambassador
                    or the DCM from the Embassy to come up as well. These were highly successful
                    events. They kept us in very close touch with the military authorities in the
                    Barcelona district as well as the civil officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The one incident I started to refer to earlier was that the show band was such a
                    good thing that the Admiral of the Sixth Fleet would want to mount a performance
                    every time the Fleet came to Barcelona, which was about every three months. That
                    was great the first couple of times. But after that even Barcelona got a little
                    saturated and also it was hard to find halls because the Navy could not charge
                    admission, and most halls wanted to charge us for the use of it.</p>
                <p>Earlier we had a little incident involving one of the big helicopter carriers
                    that had come in from Vietnam. The Marines all...this was about
                    Christmas...decided to go skiing in Andorra, which was in my consular district.
                    It was not under the Embassy. I was the only one who had real official access to
                    Andorra, although I didn't even have an exequatur because of the conflict
                    between the two “princes.” Anyway, many of the Marines had never been on skis
                    before and kept cracking themselves up by skiing into boulders and that sort of
                    thing. There also was substantial damage to one of the hotels there, which
                    created a bit of a problem for us.</p>
                <p>I had an excellent admin officer at that time so we avoided the regulations
                    saying any claims over a certain amount had to be referred to Washington but by
                    breaking down every claim below that amount we paid them off in small sums
                    avoiding delays of several years. Nevertheless the end result was that we owed a
                    certain debt to the Andorran people in principle, PR.</p>
                <p>Some time later the Department sent me a very thin, little silk Andorra flag that
                    had been carried by one of the Apollo missions to the moon with instructions to
                    present it to the people of Andorra on a suitable occasion. So on the next
                    occasion the 6th Fleet show band scheduled a visit to Barcelona, I suggested
                    taking the band to Andorra for a needed PR effect while at the same time
                    presenting the Andorran flag that had been to the moon. The event was a
                    tremendous success, although the French government became upset and even tried
                    to stop the performance because I didn't (nor did the representatives of other
                    countries) have an exequatur signed by the French co-prince of Andorra (i.e. the
                    President of France). By the same token, there were no exequaturs signed by the
                    Spanish co-prince (i.e. the Bishop of Leo de Urgel) either. But the show went
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that the Embassy more or less let
                        you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, they were very good. The Ambassador used to love to come up
                    there and we would put on various events including tours around Catalonia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back in 1974 to serve in ARA for five
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is right. I really didn't have an assignment when I came back. I
                    had interviews with the Inspection Corps, with Ken Young and also with Bill
                    Bowdler in ARA. Bill said, “We want you to take over Brazilian affairs. You have
                    Portuguese and we think it will be great.” It looked pretty good to me, I didn't
                    see anything else on the horizon at that point. I had not ever been in Brazil
                    before, and I had to do my homework fast. There was an excellent Ambassador at
                    the other end, John Crimmins. It was a great assignment and I really enjoyed it.
                    There were many problems and it was a very busy time.</p>
                <p>It became even busier when the office became responsible for all East Coast
                    Affairs including Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. We were having problems over
                    nuclear facilities in Brazil and the military agreements were going a little
                    sour because of friction on nuclear matters. They also wanted a lot more
                    military aid than we were prepared to give them at that point. Also, as I say
                    the dirty war was going on in Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dirty war being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: The dirty war was referred to the atrocities committed by both the
                    military government and the opposition. There were hidden massacres and burials
                    at night that nobody knew about. People were abducted and never heard from
                    again. People were dropped out of planes over the river. It was a very dirty
                    war.</p>
                <p>At one point Robert Hill was Ambassador there. I stayed with him usually when I
                    went to Buenos Aires. I remember riding with him with four lead cars and two
                    behind. It was that bad in terms of threats against Americans who were accused
                    of being too sympathetic with the “opposition”.It was a very dirty problem.
                    Obviously the human rights organizations here were very much up in the air, and,
                    of course, we were too. The Carter administration properly placed great emphasis
                    on human rights. There was great pressure from the White House on these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically you had military governments in all three
                        countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That is true, and Stroessner had been in Paraguay since 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Uruguay had a military government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is very interesting to look at the impact of
                        the human rights policy during Carter on the Foreign Service and its almost
                        visceral reaction about how this sort of upsets all sorts of other things. I
                        think we have learned to live with it. But this was the beginning. Did you
                        and your colleagues have trouble adjusting to this major emphasis on
                        something... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I don't think any of us held any objection to this being a real goal
                    in our foreign policy. I think what gave many of us problems was that it became
                    almost the only goal in some ways. It certainly became a predominant goal and
                    other means of achieving ends were sort of left in limbo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself going head-to-head with Pat Derian,
                        head of the Human Rights office, or others in her office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: No, you didn't go head-to-head with Pat Derian. Our Assistant
                    Secretary was very careful on this score. We followed his lead. Fred Rondon, who
                    was my Argentine Desk officer and later my deputy, had the most contact with Pat
                    Derian. In fact he accompanied her on a trip down to Argentina. He was a good
                    man for it and was bilingual in Spanish and could help out a great deal with
                    Pat. He also had good rapport with her, I think, given the circumstances. We
                    took our lead from the Assistant Secretary really on how to play this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this translate with relations? Was it one of these
                        things where we would go up and say you have to be more human rightish and
                        then go on our way and nothing would happen but we had made our bid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: My opinion is that our representations seldom led anywhere in Uruguay
                    or Argentina, certainly not in Argentina. In Argentina, one feels half out of
                    the real world. There is a feeling of being isolated from world events.
                    Certainly, they, in their own activities felt that; they didn't give a damn
                    about opinion elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They can live off their own resources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Exactly. We tried hard. I mean the violations were so egregious that
                    it wasn't hard to be in support of human rights, believe me. The violations were
                    incredible, including by the Tupamaros in Uruguay. We may have had a slightly
                    restraining role in Uruguay in some cases, but not a great success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with Brazil and human rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Human rights was a factor in Brazil...the death squads and so forth.
                    But violations had tapered off as an issue in some way versus what it had been
                    earlier, and certainly Brazil in this respect was way over-shadowed by Uruguay
                    and Argentina. But there were still problems. We got wind of violations less
                    than we did in Argentina. Information came from interviews with people who had
                    been released from prison some time later. Also, we had other fish to fry in
                    Brazil, including the nuclear issue, because they were by far the most advanced
                    in nuclear research, etc., and were dickering with the Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue on the nuclear side that got us so
                        involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, the issue was basically what their ultimate intentions were. We
                    discouraged the production of enriched uranium, which we tried to keep away from
                    most countries. Were their goals just nuclear power and research or were they
                    intent on developing military uses?</p>
                <p>We had a similar problem with the Argentines. We were very concerned. They would
                    not let us see their reactors except from a distance. But the issue didn't come
                    up as sharply as it did in Brazil because Brazil was dickering with German firms
                    for plutonium enrichment equipment and processes. In the end, the German
                    processes did not prove very successful as I remember. I think they were systems
                    that had not really been proved in themselves and as far as I know, did not
                    prove to be very useful to the Brazilians either. It cost a lot of money and
                    time and plus bad relations for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brazil, unlike most of the other Latin American countries,
                        hasn't really fought any wars with anybody for a long time. Why would it
                        want a bomb?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, Brazil sent troops to fight with us in World War II and were
                    the only Latin Americans that did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and they fought the Italian campaign. But you don't
                        have a feeling that the Brazilians are after slices of territory. What would
                        they use a bomb for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Argentina. This was the big rival on the continent and they were
                    aware that the Argentines were also pursuing nuclear development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the feeling that the Argentines are messing around
                        with nuclear things so we better have one ourselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That was the feeling on both sides, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You look at the map and you would say that you would have
                        a real hard time making much of...they abut on each other in a relatively
                        small area of little consequence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Uruguay was established as a buffer state. I think in Brazil's case
                    it was a little more than that, however. In Brazil it was a question of being a
                    big power. They always wanted to be considered a big power, particularly by the
                    US, and pointed at us and said we didn't treat them as a big power. The nuclear
                    aspect was the mark of a big power and therefore they wanted to develop this. I
                    think that was a very major part of the consideration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you evaluate our Embassies? Were we well
                        represented in those countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Well, I think under John Crimmins the Embassy was very strong in
                    Brazil. He was a top professional to my mind. In Uruguay, Larry Pezzulo, who was
                    Ambassador when I left ARA, was excellent and worked very hard. His predecessor
                    was not under the same pressures, so I think a comparison might be unfair.</p>
                <p>In Paraguay Landau did a very good job for a number of years. I visited there
                    twice. I flew back with the body of the Ambassador who died here and saw
                    Stroessner a couple of times. It was a very low key operation compared with
                    events in neighboring countries.</p>
                <p>I think Hill did a good job in Argentina although I know he was controversial. I
                    was never that closely involved with Raul Castro ...from Arizona I believe. I
                    took him through his paces here before he went down, but I did not have that
                    much of a feeling later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carter did speak some Spanish. Was there more interest in
                        ARA during his administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: I don't know. Obviously Kennedy had an interest with his Alliance for
                    Progress program. I think Johnson was so involved in the Vietnam business that
                    he probably didn't have a whole lot of time for it, at least as far as I
                    remember...I was on the Far East side at that point. I think Carter had a
                    genuine interest in Latin America. He had Bob Pastor as his NSC guy for Latin
                    America affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Rosalynn Carter make a trip to Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: Yes, she went to Brazil for an inauguration that the President could
                    not attend. I don't think the Brazilians appreciated her visit properly. I think
                    that was unfair, but again it was the old Latin machismo. She got very involved
                    in human rights down there too, which didn't endear her to the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: In February 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have you been doing since?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZIMMERMANN: That fall they were setting up the new FOI (Freedom of Information)
                    office and I started working with the first team. After about a year and a half
                    or so, Larry Pickering wanted me to join the historic document review
                    center...it was sort of a Bangkok mafia. So I moved down there and am still
                    working down there insofar as the salary cap permits me.</p>
                <p>But aside from that, most of my work during the past five years has been with the
                    Intelligence Community Staff on the HUMINT committee. That was broken up as of
                    July under Gates. My contract is being kept alive until they decide how this
                    settles down, whether they even want any contractors back. The HUMINT office is
                    being moved out to Langley and the other divisions of the old Intelligence
                    Community Staff are being parceled out elsewhere. I did mostly projects that had
                    to do with Latin American and the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. I want to thank you very much.</hi>
