                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Mr. Lahiguera]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is July 25, 2000. This is an interview with Charles
                        Lahiguera. Does your last name have anything to do with war? What does it
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: It means a fig tree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A fig tree, okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: My name is actually Garcia Lahiguera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Garcia Lahiguera. All right. Could you tell me when and
                        where you were born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I was born April 1938 in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In Queens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Queens, okay. Tell me something about your family on
                        your mother's and your father's side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, my father was actually a Spanish Foreign Service Officer. He was
                    the political officer in the embassy in Spain at the time I was born. My mother
                    had immigrated to the United States as a young girl. She was from Germany. She
                    was an American citizen at the time. The Spanish civil war was going on and my
                    father was representing the republic here. After my birth we had broken
                    relations with the republic and recognized Franco. My father took a job at
                    Williams College in 1940. Of course I don't remember that time.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a bit about the family, your father's
                        background, a family in Spain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, my grandfather, whom I never knew (he died when my father was
                    very young) was in the north of Spain. He married my grandmother in Navarre. He
                    was managing an anise liqueur business which went belly up and he ended up
                    teaching physics in Madrid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your father get, did he tell you how he got into
                        the diplomatic trade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I don't know the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you were obviously in the United States and was he in
                        the embassy in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, he was the number two there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: She had been born in Germany. She came over when she was around 16.
                    Her father was a grammar school principal. My father had been assigned to Vera
                    Cruz at the Spanish consul and they were actually married in Mexico. He was then
                    assigned to Washington and concurrently worked in the consul general in New
                    York. She was an American at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when the United States recognized the Franco
                        regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: He was out of a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Unfortunately, I should say before we get too far down this road, that
                    my family split at that time and I didn't spend a great deal of time with my
                    father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you brought up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I was brought up in Long Island until I was 10 years old. Then I moved
                    with my mother to Manhattan and I stayed there until I graduated from the eighth
                    grade. I then went to a Jesuit boarding school near Williams in Western
                    Massachusetts, Cranwell. John McLaughlin (the TV talk-show host) was one of my
                    teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk a little bit about growing up in New
                        York. Where were you going to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I went to parochial schools both in Queens and in Manhattan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the education looking back on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I had eight years of Dominican nuns in those days when they
                    still had nuns and had enough of them. It was very strict. I found out what a
                    ruler felt like on the hand and I thought it was, looking back on it, a
                    reasonable education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for New York? I mean you were there,
                        we're talking about the forties really. Did you get out and around in New
                        York at all or did you just go to school and home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, of course as a grammar school student I didn't venture too far.
                    I rode around a lot on the subway. I certainly knew Manhattan, but I did travel
                    a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any things that interested you particularly
                        while you were in elementary school while the Dominican nuns were working
                        you over for eight years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, at that time, actually my main interest was entomology. I was
                    reading a lot about insects. Everybody thought I was going to become a
                    biologist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what was your mother doing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: She became a stewardess on a ship and she ended up working on the
                    United States the first time it sailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. It was a premier liner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, and she had been on the America before. I spent a lot of time
                    with my aunt who was her sister and her husband until I was ten. They had a
                    bakery.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the baking business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No, I can't say that I learned how to do anything. I learned how to
                    make boxes that you put cakes in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because one always thinks of the terrible hours that a
                        baker has to put in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, you get up at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. This was during the
                    Second World War. I can still remember the air raid practices, turning off all
                    the lights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Cranwell, is that right? Cranwell is
                        where in Massachusetts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. In Lenox, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Lenox, Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In Western Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Western Massachusetts. And you were there for four years?
                        What year did you graduate, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: '55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, then '51 to '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Cranwell like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, we were a very small school. The student body principally came
                    from New England. We had about 200 students. It was a very nice place. We also
                    had very good discipline there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a Jesuit school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, Jesuit. Half of my teachers were Jesuits. It was well run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of subjects were you interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I became interested in history. I also took Latin and German. I
                    had an Austrian Jesuit who had been expelled from China and he taught me
                    German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Spanish? Were you getting any of the father
                        tongue or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No, I wasn't. I had to decide one way or another. I guess I just made
                    the decision to take German.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pop over to Williams from time to time? I'm a
                        graduate of Williams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I went up once to see my father. I didn't have any transportation and
                    it was a complicated process. I had to sort of slip off the campus and catch a
                    bus at Pittsfield to go up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, well, even today if you don't have a car, you're
                        out of luck almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: And, you know, no one had a car. I didn't even know how to drive a
                    car.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any elements of history, I mean I don't know
                        if you had to be a major, but you were more towards the history side of
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I was also very interested in physics. I had physics and
                    chemistry, but my math grades were just mediocre. So, I had considered majoring
                    in physics in college, but I felt that getting Bs and Cs in math, I wasn't going
                    to be a star in any science program. I was reading different things. I had read
                    this story, Wartime Mission in Spain, I think it was something like that. It
                    described how the embassy operated in trying to entice the Spaniards to
                    cooperate with us and at least stay neutral and preferably cooperate with us. I
                    found that a very fascinating account and that was one of the first times I
                    really started thinking about going into the Foreign Service. That one book
                    really plotted the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, at least something starts the process. Did
                        the outside world intrude much at Cranwell; I'm talking about news and that
                        sort of thing with much discussion about what was happening? Kids were
                        talking about the Korean War and the Cold War was heating up and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, certainly there were discussions. I can remember Dien Bien Phu
                    occurring. But we were very self-contained and there was no television, I didn't
                    have a radio. One rarely saw a newspaper, so we principally focused on our
                    studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then did you know where you were going after college
                        in 1955 when you got out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, well, I had in addition to reading this book, I found a series of
                    books on careers and one was a book on having a career in the Foreign Service.
                    It sounded so good I thought I would check to see if I wanted to do that. So, I
                    looked into where one would study and it seemed logical to me to study in
                    Washington and I discovered the Foreign Service School at Georgetown. When I
                    think back on it I was very cheeky because it was the only college I applied to.
                    In today's world where you apply to a half a dozen colleges. I didn't apply
                    anywhere else, but Georgetown and I was accepted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, had you, you were in Georgetown from I guess '55
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '59.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does one go right into the school of Foreign Service
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, it's a bachelor's degree in the Foreign Service. It's principally
                    a degree, you study economics and history and government and international
                    relations. You had to take language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Georgetown like when you first got there at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, at that point there was the Hungarian uprising.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. I think people in those days were still pro-government. There was
                    none of this cynicisms that later came up, none of the anti-U.S. government
                    activists that later appeared on the academic scene, at least I never sensed it.
                    We had the draft so people were mindful about probably having to go into the
                    military. I was romantic enough to think that I had to become a marine
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have a ROTC (Reserve Officer Training

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: We did, but we had only the army and the air force which I regarded as
                    inferior and so I ended up joining the Marines platoon leader class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, was there any particular area you
                        were concentrating on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Geographically or academically?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In the last year I took a course on Latin American economic policies.
                    I remember our current ambassador to Estonia, Melissa Wells, was a classmate of
                    mine in that class. She was in several classes although she graduated a year
                    before me. Aside from that, no. I went to a lot of different things. I went to
                    talks I remember on Algeria, the teacher was Algerian; I listened to Aba Iban
                    come to speak on the Israeli problem. I listened to various representatives of
                    the Arab groups speak. I really had a very general interest in political
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was Carter Walsh still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, he wasn't there, he wasn't teaching, he wasn't active, he was
                    alive and he died while I was there. I attended his funeral. The rector of the
                    school, the regent of the school, was a fellow named Father Frank Fadner who was
                    quite a personality by himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Catholic was Georgetown at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it wasn't and religion wasn't emphasized. If you were a
                    Catholic, you had to take theology. The non-Catholics took a great course of
                    political or philosophical thought. I thought that course was so good that I
                    audited it. I went through the whole course with no credit because I was so
                    interested, but aside from that there wasn't a great deal of emphasis on
                    religion. We had many non-Catholics and certainly many non-Christians in the
                    school, so it was very universal. There weren't that many Jesuit teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were a good number of the students in the school for
                        instance the Americans in there were they pointed towards the Foreign
                        Service or the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) or other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I had always assumed that was going to be the case, but incredibly I
                    was the only graduate in my class that I know of who joined the Foreign Service.
                    I still really don't understand that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because now of course the Foreign Service has a multitude
                        of means, but.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, they did teach things in the school to deal with for example
                    shipping and international transportation. We did have some people go into the
                    shipping business. One of my colleagues and another friend of mine who is still
                    here joined the Maritime Administration. So, there was that aspect that the
                    school was preparation for international business as well as for government.
                    Actually that idea had never occurred to me at the time I applied. As I say, I
                    was very surprised that no one else in my class entered that I'm aware of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you run across any honest to God American
                        diplomats while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. They had an FSO come down and he must have been the Algerian desk
                    officer and give us a talk and I was very impressed. He was talking about how
                    Algeria would inevitably become an independent state and that was just a
                    question of working out the settlement. That was very fascinating. One of my
                    instructors was a former USIS officer and he wasn't very good. I will not
                    mention his name, but we didn't have a great deal of contact with the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By '59, you were getting ready to get out, were you
                        following through on the Marine business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I had attended some training at Quantico. I ran into a graduate
                    student from Swarthmore who was studying at Georgetown and he had been a naval
                    intelligence officer. He told me that I was crazy in wanting to join the
                    Marines; that I would end up in the infantry in the marine corps; that rather
                    what I had to do was join naval intelligence. As a preparation for going to the
                    State Department, mind you, this was all part of the plan. I mean I was very
                    focused on where I wanted to end up. So, I switched from the Marine Corps to
                    Navy OCS (Officer Candidate School). I graduated in '59 and I ended up going to
                    Newport to OCS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just applied for OCS? This was not part of the
                        Georgetown program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Right, because Georgetown had nothing to do with the Navy or the
                    Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of training did you get? What was your
                        impression of the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it was of interest. You're talking about Newport? We spent,
                    let's see I started in February to June. I was commissioned I think on June 10th
                    in '60. Because I was healthy, you only could join naval intelligence if you had
                    a medical limitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, usually the eyes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: The eyes, so because I was healthy, they made me an air intelligence
                    officer. This was different from just being a straight O&amp;I officer. I spent
                    until June and learned celestial navigation and fire control and that kind of
                    thing. I certainly wasn't ready to take command of a ship when I left, but I
                    knew the difference between a lieutenant and a lieutenant commander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did they do with you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I was assigned to intelligence school in Norfolk, to air intelligence
                    school. Then I was attached to an anti-submarine squadron in Quonset Point,
                    Rhode Island. We flew up the last straight deck carrier, the Lake Champlain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I did that for three years. Until June of '63 and during that time my
                    ship picked up the first astronaut, Alan Shepard. I can remember him coming out
                    of the sky.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now Lake Champlain, this was a, what was it an Essex
                        class carrier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we moved to the angle deck carrier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: We were the last operating straight deck carrier. The ship is razor
                    blades now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much involved in say anti-submarine work and
                        all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I became so-called qualified as an anti-submarine officer. We
                    went chasing around Russian submarines as best we could during the Cuban
                    times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how things worked at that
                        time? Did you have a pretty good picture of where the Soviet subs were or
                        was it sort of hit or miss?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I always felt that I would be safer on a submarine. I can
                    remember some exercises when we started working with nuclear submarines. It was
                    hopeless. We were just beginning to track them when they had already sunk us.
                    That was an experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during the Cuban Missile Crisis? What were you
                        up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That was an interesting time. That was the only time that I was in
                    uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in '62, around September or something, October of
                        '62.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: It was the only time there was a serious possibility that I was going
                    to see military action. I can still remember the OP order, the operations order
                    that we received and we went out. We were instructed how to proceed and how to
                    block ships going into Cuba and how to handle those leaving Cuba. The OP order
                    was very specific on ships coming in. We were instructed how to approach them
                    and signal them and tell them to turn around especially if they had missiles. I
                    still recall reading this operations order that went through all the procedures
                    where you give them a warning and you told them to turn around and if they
                    didn't, you would do something else. If they didn't do what you told them, you
                    have to radio the Pentagon to get permission to do whatever was next. I remember
                    turning the page of the OP order and it said if they don't do all the above, you
                    sink them. It really startled me that we had instructions in writing. We were
                    authorized to sink them. That was the revelation, but fortunately, once we
                    deployed they did turn around. All we did was photograph ships leaving Cuba. We
                    had cameras. I was also the federal officer in my squad. We had cameras aboard
                    our aircraft. We had S-2 trackers and we photographed a lot of missiles
                    leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess many of those pictures that often did show up on
                        the front pages of major newspapers later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Only if the Pentagon released them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure they did. But, was the feeling that this
                        may be it or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, when we went to sea it had felt that way. But as soon as we got
                    there and the ships started to turn around, then we knew it was all over. So,
                    that was a great relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was. How did you like navy life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I enjoyed it, but I was also looking forward to getting out. I took
                    the Foreign Service exam while I was in the navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pass it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I didn't pass it the first time. Actually I took it the first time as
                    a practice anyhow because I couldn't have gone in even had I passed it. I'm a
                    great believer of taking exams to see what they're like. I think it helps a lot.
                    So, I didn't pass it the first time, but I did pass it the second time in April
                    of, let's see, '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the oral exam? Do you recall any of the
                        questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I went in uniform to the exam. It was on April 6, '63 I believe
                    and there were three officers who interviewed me. The chairman I believe was an
                    economic officer and I can remember questions from both exams. The first time I
                    passed the written and I didn't pass the oral, but the second time I passed them
                    both. On that particular exam the chairman said he realized I wasn't a graduate
                    of the naval academy, did I perhaps know who the first admiral in the navy was?
                    That sort of put my back out of it because when you're in the navy, you are
                    forever at war with the guys who graduated from the academy. So, I said, “Well,
                    first of all let me say I feel that I am just as good as any other naval
                    officer.” I said that the panel should feel free to ask me any questions they
                    wished on the navy. And the question was, Admiral Farragut from the Civil War.
                    They then sort of apologized for the question, which I think, gave me a great
                    psychological advantage. It was an interesting experience and I will certainly
                    not forget that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course Farragut was a graduate, he came up the
                        midshipman way and I think he was even in the War of 1812 wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I believe so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your wife onboard as far as the Foreign Service and
                        all that? What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. She had been born in New York, in Long Island. She had attended
                    college in Queens, Queens College. She seemed very interested in going
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they tell you right off that you had passed the

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. I remember the chairman asked what I wanted to do and I said,
                    well, I was interested in political affairs. Later on he gave me a little
                    lecture that economics was also important and I wasn't to neglect it
                    entirely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got exactly the same lecture in 1955 when I had trouble
                        with the economic side. I think this comes standard. Well, then when did you
                        actually come into the Foreign Service?</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I came in in July. I got out of the navy in June, around June 10th and
                    I came in in the end of July sometime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The A-100 or the basic officer's course. What was your
                        impression of the various people there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, let me say first that when I came in, they didn't have room for
                    me in the A-100 course. So, I was assigned to Soviet Eastern European staff in
                    the European Bureau and worked for a fellow named Frank Siscoe, the director and
                    I was given the responsibility for Polish exchanges. I thought this was rather
                    incredible. I had just walked off the street and I sat behind this desk. All of
                    a sudden I was involved in all kinds of stuff, writing letters and making phone
                    calls and I was just barely learning the names of all the things. I can remember
                    one thing that really struck me. Foy Kohler was our ambassador to the Soviet
                    Union at that time and he came in and we had a big conference in one of the
                    conference rooms in the Department. They had invited all the members of the
                    Soviet directorate and all of our staff to this conference. We all sat around
                    this big table and Foy Kohler sat at the head. There was a general discussion of
                    what our relations with the Soviet Union were and the way things were going. At
                    that, when they got done, he asked that all the officers present would please
                    comment. We went around the table and I was just amazed. I mean I had spent
                    three years in the navy and no admiral had ever asked my opinion on anything,
                    much less somebody like Foy Kohler. Needless to say, I did not have anything to
                    add to our current position on the Soviet Union. But the fact that I was asked
                    my opinion on it made me realize that I had to start thinking about what we were
                    doing. I've found that through the years people in the Foreign Service many
                    times didn't care particularly about your grade, if they felt you had something
                    interesting to say. That was very refreshing. That was a big difference between
                    the Department of Defense and the State Department. So, anyhow I went through
                    several months there and I ended up in the A-100 course sometime in
                    November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you must have been able to recall how the
                        assassination of President Kennedy hit Washington and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I was in the A-100 course at the time when the president was
                    assassinated. I remember very well. I remember going to class and our moderator
                    got up and said that they just had news that the president had been killed in
                    Dallas. I remember the shock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of that spirit became sort of the arrival on the
                        scene of the next generation that was really a World War II generation,
                        Kennedy and government service being such a something of honor and all that.
                        Had that permeated do you think your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. One big difference from today is that at least half of the
                    Foreign Service class, at least half of the men, had been officers in the
                    military. So, there was a great deal of difference in the attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the class? Was it many women or minorities or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I wouldn't say many, but I would think at least a quarter of our
                    class were women, maybe more. The only member of our class who became ambassador
                    was a woman, Teresa Tull. In fact, my recollection is she was the only member of
                    the class who didn't have a college degree. We accepted people who didn't have
                    college degrees and we still may. I hope we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I don't think it's a requirement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: She was obviously very intelligent. Anyone who passes the exams in
                    those days and didn't have a college degree was pretty bright. Anyhow, I thought
                    it was a very interesting class. I still have contacts with several other
                    members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you pointed towards something at all? I mean
                        personally pointed toward something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I had taken German. You had to qualify in a language, so my
                    immediate objective was to be assigned to a German speaking post so that I could
                    get qualified in German. While I was at Georgetown I went to the University of
                    Munich and I studied there for a semester. Then when they asked me which way I
                    wanted to go, I said Munich. I still remember the personnel officer said,
                    “That's not very likely. You got anything else?” I said, “Well, I'll go anywhere
                    you want to send me. I don't mind, but I would like a German speaking post and
                    you asked me where I wanted to go and I want to go to Munich.” So, he said, “All
                    right, if Munich is your answer then we'll write it down.” I can still remember
                    the day when they read out all the assignments and they got to my name and they
                    said Munich. I almost fell off a chair. The personnel officer wanted to know
                    what I wanted and so I told him. They were very gracious and gave it to me. I
                    had a happy relationship with personnel as far as assignments are concerned ever
                    since. I loved every assignment I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Munich from '64?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I got out of the A-100 course in the end of '63. Because of my
                    assignment unit, they assigned me German language. I went through that five
                    months or six months. Anyhow, it was the summer time. They ended up deciding
                    that our class would go to the passport office and issue passports for the
                    summer. This was going to somehow save the Department money and they wouldn't
                    have to bring in temporary people. Anyhow, so we ended up issuing passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I stayed here in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That doesn't sound like much fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: At least it gave a little stability and then after that assignment I
                    went off to Munich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Munich from '64 to '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: From '65 to '66.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As consular officer, what were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, in those days we rotated which I actually thought was a very
                    good idea. The idea was you would spend six months in each of the cones. That
                    was the concept, but it didn't always work. They needed you most in the consular
                    section, so I was first assigned to non-immigrant visas and issued tourist
                    visas. Which actually in Munich is a very pleasant duty because you have
                    enormous records and the local authorities are very cooperative and the Germans
                    absolutely don't like to say anything improper to an official. So, when you
                    interview them they pour their heart out generally. They are very easy compared
                    to other cultures that I've dealt with like New Delhi. That was very nice. I
                    spent six months as a visa officer and then I expected to go to the commercial
                    economic section or the administrative section. They decided that I had to go to
                    the passport section and so I spent six months there. Then I was assigned to the
                    political section, which was great. The political officer, a fellow named Andy
                    Stalder decided to go on home leave so I became the political officer of the
                    post, which was nice. I listened to some of Franz Josef Strauss's very long and
                    I must say boring speeches on agricultural policy and things like that and I
                    attended rallies. I remember writing a report on May Day in Bavaria and I'm sure
                    that must have put somebody to sleep. We had both the right wing nationalist
                    parties and the pro-communist parties active. I attended meetings of both of
                    them, rallies of both of them and their speeches, which were at least more
                    entertaining. I can remember I used to talk to the military intelligence people
                    at the post. They did a lot of photographing in those days. I can remember being
                    in one pro-communist party meeting and having somebody with a camera in the
                    crowd and focusing on me. I'm going to be some DIA and they're going to try and
                    figure who in the world I am. Anyhow it was interesting. We had an upcoming
                    election and I wrote a report saying that I expected the nationalist party to be
                    seated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in Bavaria I imagine we were paying very
                        close attention to particularly the nationalists, weren't we? This is where
                        Hitler had started and was a theme that lasted for a long, long time. I
                        think in news today the Germans turn right sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Well, I had predicted that they were going to gain enough votes
                    to be seated. I felt that their election was really as the result of a protest.
                    Many people voted for the left or right simply because they were dissatisfied
                    with the principal parties. I didn't think there was a serious move in that
                    direction. When I said that to the desk they suddenly lost interest in my
                    predictions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find as a political officer there were you
                        able to go around and talk to the people from the various parties and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, all the parties. I attended as many of the functions as I could.
                    I felt we were very warmly received by the socialists and by the Christian
                    democrats. We had great access, the majority were extremely pro-American at the
                    time. Although there was a vocal anti-Americanism over Vietnam and they had made
                    me also the assistant security officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: A fellow named Bob Keel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant amount of students going to the
                        United States at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In fact I had to stay on the Fulbright committee to help select
                    students to go. USIS got me into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, having gone to the University of Munich and sort
                        of being of the age and all, so many students at the university,
                        particularly the European ones locate in the United States, go through a
                        Marxist stage. I mean was there a significant number who were sort of going
                        through that phase?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I can't say that I found that. I had a lot of German friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting, you personally, but also other
                        people in the embassy who were dealing with this. What was the estimate of
                        Franz Josef Strauss there? He was a pretty dominant figure of Bavarian
                        politics at the time? Did you feel that he was a loose canon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I would say he probably had aspirations of becoming the prime
                    minister. I can remember we had a lot of focus on the offset agreement. That
                    experience led me away from Europe because I felt things moved glacially there.
                    I didn't find it very interesting. It's hard. I mean working on this the
                    politics of Germany are interesting, but they really don't change very much.
                    They didn't change their relationship with us very much. We didn't have any
                    great differences. So, I really decided that this was not the area that I
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back what, in late '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: As I said personnel was always very nice to me and they asked me where
                    I wanted to go. I said, “Well, I'd like to go to the Caribbean.” I was in EUR
                    and the next thing I knew I had orders to Curacao as a consular officer. Curacao
                    was under the European Bureau. I think that's part of it, but they said they
                    needed me sooner than later than I was scheduled to leave, so I was cut from

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there in '66 in Curacao?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, I believe so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No, that's another story. I went there as a consular officer and there
                    were only three officers at the post and two American staff so, there were five
                    of us. I enjoyed it. I could write a book about that place alone. While I was
                    there I was still very naive about how the State Department operated. After I'd
                    been there about six months, we received one of these worldwide telegrams
                    looking for a volunteer for Vietnam. I wrote an airgram and said in reference to
                    their worldwide appeal I would be interested in being considered for an
                    assignment in Vietnam on my next tour and then plunked that thing in the mail.
                    The next thing I know, about three weeks time, I got a cable back from the
                    Department saying warmly we'd accept your offer, you've been transferred to
                    Vietnam. The consul general was a very unhappy man. I'd only been there one
                    year. He said, “you know, what did you expect?” I said my message was that I
                    wanted to leave for there on my next tour, I wasn't asking for a direct
                    transfer. I didn't realize how desperate they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about the time you were in Curacao. What
                        was the political situation in Curacao at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: They belonged to the Netherlands. I was actually assigned to the
                    Netherlands Antilles. There were six islands. We got our accreditation from the
                    queen of the Netherlands. I only saw two of the islands. We had a very large
                    American presence on Aruba, which is to the west of Curacao. Standard Oil had a
                    large refinery. Curacao has a large refinery as well, Shell. Shell dominated
                    Curacao. It was a very interesting society. They had a governor and a queen who
                    was a local person. They had their own communist run government and they were
                    all local people. There was a very small Dutch military force. They had a
                    destroyer, a very small navy. It was really quite minimal.</p>
                <p>I had the impression the Dutch would have been glad if they had left the
                    Netherlands and become independent. But they didn't want to become independent
                    because they had a fear of Venezuela. They feared Venezuela would grab them and
                    take them or at least take over Aruba and probably Bonaire.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>We didn't have any problems at all there. Everybody went to Florida to study or
                    go on vacation. The relationship with the consulate general was very warm. The
                    political differences really were with the Netherlands if there were any or with
                    the other Latin American countries. We were the good guys in Curacao. I remember
                    proposing an idea of having joint marine naval exercise in Curacao where we'd
                    have the marines invade Curacao and everybody thought that was a splendid idea.
                    Then we got a cable back from the Latin American bureau saying okay, we can do
                    that. Of course the following attach�s would like to attend the exercise. They
                    included the Venezuelan local attach�. His involvement blew the idea out of the
                    water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Horace Euston was the consul general. He was a retired FBI officer. He
                    must have had some political connection to have gotten this job. They were
                    charming people and we got along very well with the government at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about was there an independence movement there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Not the least. As I say, they didn't want to be independent because
                    they felt if the Dutch left, the Venezuelans would be there. The Dutch supported
                    the government and they gave them all kinds of study opportunities and
                    scholarships. They had all kinds of programs to help the Curacaoans. I guess
                    they just felt they wouldn't get such a good deal from anybody else and the
                    Dutch really let them do what they wished aside from having them base a
                    destroyer there which I think they eventually sent home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much talk of Venezuela?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. We had a lot of boats come in from Venezuela selling fruits and
                    vegetables. I would say the average person in Curacao spoke four languages,
                    which I just found amazing. They had a local language and they spoke Dutch and
                    they spoke English and they spoke Spanish. I don't know if I ever met any
                    Curacaoan who didn't speak all four of those languages. They broadcast the
                    television in all four. My children, my oldest one started in a Curacao school.
                    All of the schools started in Dutch. You had Dutch the first year and you
                    started English the second year. I think by the fourth year you were taking
                    Spanish. If you watched their television, they'd have a program in English and
                    the next one would be in Spanish and the next one would be in Dutch. They had
                    Dutch news broadcast and they had English news broadcast. So, it was really very
                    multi-language operation. Very interesting.</p>

                        was wondering whether it was then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In fact I would say that it was more important. We got ships in all
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was quite a contrast wasn't it, to have something that
                        looked sort of European all of a sudden. Were there problems with American
                        tourists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I could spend the whole afternoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me a story or two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, the Dutch ran a state brothel. They had a lot of merchant
                    seaman. So, they set this place up. The arrangement was that all the staff in
                    the brothel were foreigners. They were all there temporarily. They'd come in by
                    visa and left after just a few months. They were all very closely controlled by
                    the Dutch medical authorities who controlled everybody's arrival and departure.
                    No local personnel were allowed to work there only the foreigners. There were no
                    local women engaged in prostitution. They were very severe about anyone who
                    wanted to be an independent entrepreneur in Curacao. They really had this thing
                    under control. We were involved because we had an arrangement with the police
                    regarding the granting of visas to work in this place. I'd check the names with
                    the police and the police would say yes, we gave them a visa to work there. I
                    can also remember one American problem I had. A fellow who was a member of a
                    very prominent family was mentally unstable and he used to come in the consulate
                    and give us a tirade. He'd throw his passport down and he tore up his
                    nationalization papers. He was a nationalized citizen, but he was obviously not
                    stable. We wanted to send him back. He used to sleep on the street and we wanted
                    to send him back to the United States for medical treatment. The police didn't
                    want to touch him because his family was too prominent. They didn't want to
                    force him to do anything, so I used to try to talk him into getting on an
                    airplane. I was never successful at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you applied for Vietnam and Vietnam had been sort of
                        boiling around, what was your impression from where you were about Vietnam
                        at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, when I had put my name down, there was so much controversy. I
                    had seen a lot of it in Munich including the anti-war protests. I wanted to see
                    it for myself and to resolve whether we should be there or not. I wanted to get
                    on the ground and see what this was all about.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I guess the end of '66.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Vietnam from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I went back to Washington and they put me in a training course.
                    In fact I was in the same class with Terry McNamara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. This was our operations and rural development course. It was our
                    aid program on the ground. It was funded by USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, '66 to '67 you were in training mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. The training at FSI was at Arlington Towers. The atmosphere in
                    the language school was not very cordial. In fact, it wasn't like anything I
                    ever saw before or since. It was a very unfortunate situation. I was interested
                    in learning Vietnamese, but many of the students assigned were first year
                    students. They were brought in after the A-100 course. It was my impression that
                    they all were assigned to Vietnam. A lot of these candidates had a very
                    adversarial attitude. They didn't want to learn Vietnamese and they didn't want
                    to go to Vietnam. The Department was going to make them by George and it was
                    shape up or else. This was their welcoming speech. They had a woman in charge of
                    the program who I did not admire at all. I felt there was a lot of unnecessary
                    hostility. I was working along and I remember there was one young man studying
                    with me, a fellow named Vespa. He had no problems learning Vietnamese and he
                    spoke French. He had just come I think from graduate school somewhere. He had a
                    very good education. He had just finished graduate school and didn't want to go
                    to the language school. So, he didn't want to study Vietnamese and they were
                    giving him all kinds of problems. So, he finally just resigned and he ended up
                    getting a job I think in Greece with Citibank. He was perfectly willing to go.
                    He just left because they were being so unpleasant. At the time of this program
                    Westmoreland had started putting some light on the end of it and I had a vision
                    that I was going to go through this year learning Vietnamese and the war was
                    going to end and I would be the only Vietnamese speaking officer assigned to
                    Ottawa. In between that, I thought the people managing the course were just
                    terrible. I finally went to personnel and said, look I don't need the language
                    qualification, as far as qualifying I had the requirements to go. I just wanted
                    to go. I didn't ask for language training. If you don't think I have to have it,
                    just let me know. They said, all right, we'll take care of it. The next thing I
                    know I was assigned to leave. They terminated my training and I was about to
                    leave when the Tet invasion occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: January of '68 I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Exactly. So, I was just waiting for the airport to reopen and as soon
                    as it reopened, I flew in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you got to, you were in Vietnam from '68, early '68
                        until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: '68 to '69. Towards the end of '69, so roughly two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tet was basically still going on at the time you got
                        there, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, obviously there was still a lot of fighting and there was a
                    curfew in Saigon. You had to be in by 8:00.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you sort of met and got absorbed in the apparatus
                        when you got to Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I was processed in and they said, what do you want to do and where do
                    you want to go. I said, look I'm a volunteer. Put me where you want. So, they
                    said, okay, we'll think about it. I was still very naive about all this. They
                    said, well, I think we're going to send you to the refugee camp. I said, that's
                    fine. Then a fellow come in and said they needed a refugee officer up in this
                    province, the Phuoc Long province which was in the third corps on the Cambodian
                    border. I said, fine, I'll go. Phuoc Long province is a special place. They only
                    took volunteers for Phuoc Long province and allowed us to inspect it first. So,
                    I flew up to Phuoc Long province.</p>
                <p>Actually where we were was Song Be. We had no roads in Phuoc Long, I mean none
                    that we owned. The only way to get in and out of Phuoc Long was to fly. It had
                    very steep decline. They had to have them shooting out of airplanes coming in.
                    So, I remember at the little airstrip they had a big sign saying, “Song Be can
                    be dangerous to your health.” We had all kinds of black humor. There was a
                    Lieutenant Colonel Rider who was in charge. He lived in a little trailer, which
                    was bunkered with concrete. I found it an interesting place. I fell in love with
                    the place and went back and told them I'd go. They assigned me to Phuoc Long and
                    I became the refugee officer at Phuoc Long .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now what was sort of the CORDS (Civil Operations and
                        Revolutionary Development Support) team consist of in that province?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, in provinces that were militarily active, the senior province
                    advisor was the military officer. We had military principals in the province and
                    we had a deputy civilian under contract. A gentleman named John Joseph who was a
                    FAA retired airborne colonel from the Second World War and he had done combat
                    jumps in Europe. He was highly respected by the military. He was a very
                    competent officer. I liked him a great deal. We had a civilian admin officer and
                    a GSO. I had to worry about most of the refugee population. John Joseph did the
                    civilian, other civilian programs. I focused on the refugees. We had about 100
                    Americans I'd say assigned on the team. Most of them were military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the military situation while you were there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: We didn't have any large units in our province and we were defended
                    principally by a local force, a local Vietnamese force. We even had bunkers and
                    our advisory team on the military side made several bunkers. The normal
                    civilians lived separately in prefabricated housing. I had a little trailer with
                    a local hired Vietnamese guard. We were protected principally by the Vietnamese
                    military. Our military was involved in immediate protection of the Americans. We
                    had one reconnaissance airplane. The town of Phuoc Long had the main airfield
                    where we got supplies in. All supplies had to be brought in by airplane and were
                    taken out by air. We had an advisory team living in that town as well. There was
                    a district team in each district. There were camps along the border. They led a
                    D camp in Song Be. I got to see all of these places and worked at them all. As I
                    said, there were a lot of refugees, mostly Montagnards. Most were from towns
                    near a Vietnamese communist infiltration route. They had been told to move and
                    they didn't move and the communists came and burned the towns. We tried to get
                    big projects done and give them everything they needed. We built refugee
                    villages. When the communists came in and drove people out, they'd be given some
                    land and provided supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the communists were basically forcing the
                        resettlement as opposed to our trying to keep people together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Oh yes, no we didn't have any force at all. This was all triggered by
                    their military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they trying to do, the communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, they used this area as an approach towards Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they mainly North Vietnamese as opposed to Viet
                        Cong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. After Tet my impression, my experience was that we always were
                    against North Vietnam. I was in one district that was used as a processing place
                    for bringing troops in. They shot down one of our planes when I was there. It
                    severed an artery of the pilot. He was able to land the plane, but he died
                    because he lost so much blood. He died before we could get him out. Then our
                    district advisor was in a staff meeting, there were only about a half a dozen of
                    them and they took a shell right under the table and killed them all. We had
                    these Swiss aircraft, that's what they called them? They were able to set down
                    on a very short runway. They were designed to fly in the Alps. We used to get
                    them to get in and used helicopters to get out to the districts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing for the refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Mainly, just monitoring their conditions and providing what they
                    needed, food, tin roofing. Arranging for medical visits and getting military to
                    the refugee camps. I spent a lot of time in the camps. I brought a lot of
                    patients from the camps to our hospital. We had a hospital manned by both
                    Vietnamese and U.S. army doctors. I used to spend a lot of time going back and
                    forth. I remember dramatically. There was a young boy with the bubonic plague. I
                    just thought it was amazing that in this day and age, he had this stuff. He had
                    a very swollen neck and under his arm. It just infected his glands. I remember
                    talking to his mother. She didn't want to let him go to the hospital. If he
                    didn't go, I guaranteed he would be dead in a week. The refugees had the belief
                    if you go to the hospital you die. We got this fellow there and he was cured
                    with penicillin. You could get the plague in the dry season before the rains
                    came; apparently the rains killed the flu. We had to worry about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting much on the political situation in
                        Vietnam itself or could you find yourself living in your own little world
                        pretty much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, you lived in your own little world. We were surviving. We were
                    under pretty frequent attacks. Little mortars fell regularly. There was an
                    incident with a journalist, I think he was from New York. Anyhow, we were all in
                    the military mess, in the military camp and mortars came in and we were just
                    about to start dessert. We all dropped on the floor and these mortars dropped
                    onto the compound and they were buzzing around and then it stopped. Everybody
                    got up and brushed off the dirt and sat down and started passing the tea. This
                    poor journalist was just shattered. He was off on the next flight out.</p>
                <p>One other interesting thing while I was there. The senior officer, this colonel,
                    had been wounded before I got there. Not in the same place, I forgot what
                    location, but he had been leaning out of a bunker and a rocket came by and
                    creased his head a little bit and he had a scar on his forehead. I went over to
                    see him one afternoon after I was there five or six months. I parked the car and
                    I was just about to go to his office, this was in the middle of the afternoon,
                    and we got a shower of mortars. I was trying very hard to become part of the
                    floor of this nearby building and my car got splattered. I had a white shirt on.
                    When I got up, I looked like somebody who had just cleaned the chimney. The
                    place was a mess. Our senior advisor was sitting at his desk and he had shrapnel
                    come right through the wall. He had a package of cigars in his back pocket and
                    they cut through the cigars and got him in the rear end so we had to move him
                    around on a stretcher. We medevaced him out and he elected since that was the
                    second time he was wounded, he elected not to come back. He allowed us to pack
                    him out. We shipped his stuff to Saigon and I remember his replacement was a
                    gentleman by the name of Lieutenant Colonel Ray Suarez, I believe from Mexico.
                    Suarez was another volunteer who had extended his stay in Vietnam and he stayed
                    close to a year or so. We were attacked and he was killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Vietnamese officials you
                        saw there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, we had a colonel who was the province chief and I thought he was
                    very good. I remember when Suarez got killed, after the day we were supposed to
                    be overrun, he went around in his armored personnel carrier and waved at
                    everybody just to show that they had not gotten him. I worked with the
                    Vietnamese district officers. I found them quite confident. There was some
                    animosities between the Vietnamese and the Montagnards. That was a problem and
                    I'm sure it still exists even now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I think it's traditional really. It's the mountain
                        folks and the plains folks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it's more than that because they're ethnically completely
                    different. The Montagnards are more closely related to Cambodians and the
                    Vietnamese are more closely related to the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself ever telling the Vietnamese
                        officials to ease up or be better dealing with the Montagnards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: What I did have to do was make sure that they provided the Montagnard
                    refugees what they were entitled to. That was one of the things that I was there
                    for. I had a counterpart in the Refugee Bureau. He managed to show that he had
                    siphoned off some supplies and I had called in the inspector general for the
                    Vietnamese service. They did an investigation and confirmed it. He was demoted,
                    but he was sent to Dalat, which is a resort area. That was a very Vietnamese way
                    of handling things. I think there was this feeling that Montagnards ought to be
                    taught in Montagnard schools in Montagnard, in their language. I always thought
                    this was insane because if they were going to learn, if they were going to
                    participate in the Vietnamese economy, they had to learn Vietnamese and they had
                    to be accustomed to dealing with the Vietnamese society. So, we did build
                    refugee schools and staffed them with Vietnamese instructors. I don't think this
                    was completely in accord with the instructions. First of all, we couldn't get
                    Montagnard instructors and I didn't think it was realistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the writ of CORDS and the embassy play where you
                        were? Were you getting visitors from Saigon quite often from the CORDS
                        headquarters and then also from the embassy and the political section and
                        all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In Song Be we didn't get too many visitors. We went down to Bien Hoa,
                    which was the III Corps headquarters periodically and did reporting, but they
                    seemed to feel if we survived we were meeting the requirements.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that this was a place where you could
                        really hang out? Why weren't you overrun? Why did it stay this sort of
                        static position of lots of fighting around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, they attempted to overrun us. I can remember towards the end of
                    my time there, they made a major push against us and we brought in a lot of
                    helicopter gun ships and these fixed wing aircraft. Puff the Magic Dragon was
                    what they were called and all these 50 caliber machine guns on the side. We also
                    had artillery. There was an artillery base in Quang Ngai. We pounded them pretty
                    severely. After this one assault the Montagnards reported to us that the North
                    Vietnamese forces carried the bodies out all night. We generally knew what unit
                    was in the area and what regiment of course, so as I said we weren't talking
                    about the so-called VC (Viet Cong).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did this for what, almost how long were you
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Just over 18 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long time though in a place like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it, yes, I guess. Well, actually I take that back. In Song Be I
                    was there a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I was assigned to the first corps as a refugee advisor, a coordinator
                    in the first quarter between Saigon and Da Nang. In fact I went up and visited
                    Terry McNamara who was the deputy principal officer in the northern most
                    province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quang Tri?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Quang Tri. When I left Song Be I can recall I had brought down an
                    officer from Quang Tri. A guy named Bob. He had been a little wild up there. I
                    can remember telling folks that if he continues doing what he has been doing in
                    Quang Tri down in Quang Ngai, he's not going to make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because he was going out where he shouldn't go
                        and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. They sent him down to us on a temporary basis and they wanted me
                    to evaluate him and so I had him for a few weeks. My third boss then a colonel,
                    and I remember after seeing this doctor for a couple of weeks, I said, “Well
                    I've got six months left on the tour and I'm going to go out but he'll be dead
                    before then.” The colonel said to me, “Well, if we don't take him, we don't have
                    anybody else. It's either him or nobody.” I said, “Well, colonel you know that's
                    your decision, but that's my view of it.” I left and he was dead in about two
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: He went down, he took a convoy down to a refugee area. He was in the
                    lead jeep with a new captain who I'm sure didn't know where he was and our best
                    Montagnard interpreter and they had an ambush set up for them. He drove right
                    into it and he got several slugs in the chest. I had to bring in a new refugee
                    officer, Joe Langlois who I still have contact with. It was a very eerie
                    experience; just because his predecessor was killed didn't mean he was going to
                    be killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How could somebody have avoided that type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I mean he was in a very risky area. You've got to know where you
                    could go and where you probably shouldn't go and you don't monitor on roads
                    where there is a rice convoy. He also used to go off in cars as scouts into the
                    high risk areas with a radio and call for artillery strikes on what he felt were
                    communist positions. Not a part of his job. I was very sorry that he lost that
                    poor captain — who I'm sure didn't know what was going on — and an irreplaceable
                    Montagnard interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the last six months, what were you doing? Were you
                        working out of Saigon with the first corps?</hi>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I went up to the first corps and reported on the refugee conditions
                    there. Remember George Moose was one of our refugee officers there? He was on
                    his first tour? I remember meeting him there and spending the evening with him.
                    Larry Colbert, he was in Quang Ngai. I just saw him. He's the consul general in
                    Paris now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred Allner was there, too, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That name sounds very familiar. You could drive from pretty much the
                    whole length up to Da Nang from the bottom up to Da Nang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I drove up from Da Nang about that time, '69 or '70 when I
                        was with a British vice consul and in the helicopter to Quang Tri. How did
                        the situation look to you, I mean we're talking about '69, wasn't it when
                        you were there? I mean you were in Saigon. Did you find it was a different
                        world in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes and in fact I found I was never comfortable in Saigon. I
                    occasionally would go there. I didn't care for the Vietnamese I met there very
                    much. I didn't care for the social events because I was always mindful that
                    people were being killed and these people were having a pretty good time. The
                    Vietnamese liked to speak French and they had been to Paris. I didn't know if
                    they had many of their sons who were fighting. There was an elite class. I was
                    sad to see that a lot of our people in Saigon hung around with that Vietnamese
                    class. I realized you had to do that because you have to know what the power
                    structure is thinking and where it is going. We're not missionaries. On the
                    other hand, it was a terrible contrast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course this is what happens in a war between sort
                        of headquarters and out in the trenches. Well, you left there in '69, say
                        around the summer of '69 or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. I had been inspected in Vietnam and I had fully expected to be
                    assigned to Washington. The inspectors said well, they didn't think it was
                    necessary that I had to go back to Washington. They asked me where I'd like to
                    go and I said, “Well, I'd like to go someplace where I'd learn another
                    language.” Well, I ended up being assigned to the our delegation in Paris to
                    UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). So, I
                    went back for French language training and then I went to UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were off to UNESCO after French training and this
                        would be by this time it must be close to 1970, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it was still '69.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: '69 to '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '73. We'll pick it up at that point. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is August 1, 2000. You wanted to make a few comments more about what you
                    were actually doing rather than just the sort of dramatic dangerous side.</p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: One of the reasons I went to Vietnam was to resolve for myself if what
                    we were doing was to benefit the people of Vietnam and was in the spirit of our
                    own views of democracy and government. I was very satisfied when I was there
                    that we were on the right side. While I was there I lived at what was the de
                    facto capital Song Be. I visited all the district capitals. I visited all the
                    principal villages. I ate in the villages, I shopped in the markets, I slept out
                    in the different towns. I never felt threatened by the people. I always felt
                    welcomed by them. I got my hair cut in the markets. I felt free to travel in the
                    communities themselves. Now, of course, going from one area to another we had
                    large Vietnamese forces present nearby and there was always a chance of ambush
                    or being attacked, but I never felt threatened by the community. I never felt
                    any hostility from the people I worked with. We worked on about 20,000
                    resettlements of what we called refugees, 20,000 refugees. In fact, from the
                    legal point of view they are displaced persons because they were people
                    displaced in their own country. I was very comfortable working with them. They
                    had great needs and they seemed to welcome my appearance. Often when I went to
                    the camps and returned to my office I picked up many, many people along the
                    road, none of whom, or most of whom I didn't know. I never had a fear of
                    strangers or anything like that. So, while some of my comments before may give
                    the impression of being always threatened, a hostile atmosphere, in fact the
                    people were very cordial and I think the American community was very welcomed by
                    the indigenous people, obviously not by the North Vietnamese units.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Another point as far as what we did: my function particularly was to ensure that
                    under the arrangements, I was being paid by USAID funds, and under this
                    development arrangement we provided certain things to the Vietnamese government
                    and we wanted to ensure that this was reaching the people. That was my job. When
                    somebody was displaced and government arranged for them to have a new area to
                    develop, they provided land. We overlooked the distribution of food to keep them
                    sustained while they built their communities, while they built their housing. We
                    provided, through the Vietnamese government, building materials and schools. I
                    monitored to make sure that all this was distributed properly, people got what
                    they were entitled to, tried to encourage medical care from our military who
                    were very good in coming by and providing care. I could give you a whole morning
                    of stories of medical treatment which I encountered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, give a little.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: We'd go down to the villages and the army doctors and medics would
                    treat people. They had a lot of tuberculosis. They had malaria. There was even a
                    leper colony. I can remember going to the leper colony with a doctor. We'd have
                    to go across the Song Be River on boxes that were wired together, but they
                    floated and they were loose and we'd hop from box to box. We got to the other
                    side to this leper colony. There was one particular lady in a hut. She had
                    leprosy and she had TB (Tuberculosis) and the doctor said she was obviously in
                    terrible condition. We got permission from her husband to take her back to the
                    hospital and I ended up with this doctor having this lady on a stretcher. We
                    were going from box to box and I had this terrible fear that if one of us tilted
                    she'd end up in the river. So, we got her across and we got her onto a makeshift
                    ambulance that we had. We got her back to the hospital. I remember the next
                    morning when we visited she had crawled out because she feared being in the
                    hospital. It was a common problem that the local people felt that you went to
                    the hospital to die. That's just one story.</p>
                <p>So, I tried to ensure that they got all their entitlements. We saw at least a
                    half a dozen refugee villages built in various stages. The communist forces did
                    at one point come in and they burned at least three of our villages. I certainly
                    felt that the North Vietnamese armies were actually as much against the people
                    as against us. As far as our forces there we only had a 100 man advisory team,
                    but we had special forces in the area. We had three or four camps. We had an ARV
                    ranger battalion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ARV stands for the Army of the Republic of Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That's correct. We had special forces type people led by Green Berets
                    that were inserted in the jungle to ambush the enemy. We also had large
                    artillery units that fired a lot during the evening. I was always impressed by
                    the fact that you could sleep through; at least I acquired the ability to sleep
                    through our firings all night. When the first shell from the other side came in
                    I was awakened instantly. How I could ever recognize the difference in sound I
                    don't know, but I did. Anyhow, we did have sufficient forces in the area and we
                    had people like the first air cavalry who would come in and give support when we
                    were attacked in large numbers which did happen. So, we hung on while we were
                    there. The civilians that were there were a good team. We worked well together.
                    We enjoyed the people. We believed that we enjoyed being there and we enjoyed
                    working with those people. Nobody that I can recall ever wanted to move. I
                    eventually took an assignment as a coordinator in the first district simply to
                    see another part of Vietnam because I had spent this whole time in the province
                    of Phuoc Long and occasionally going to meetings in Bien Hoa. I wanted to see a
                    little bit more of the country and really that's why I finally decided I wanted
                    to move on. Anyhow, I think you can see the atmosphere in the community was
                    very, very good. I got along very well with the officials. There was a district
                    chief named Lu Yem. I think he was in Bo Duc right on the Cambodian border. He
                    was a major and I was later to work with him when he became the province chief
                    of Phuoc Long and then eventually the province chief of Bien Hoa. I last saw him
                    operating a laundromat in Arlington. I think that is essentially what I wanted
                    to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you're with UNESCO and you're working with
                        UNESCO from '69 to '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did UNESCO involve and where did it sort of fall
                        within the political spectrum of the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, UNESCO is the United Nations Organization for Education, Science
                    and Culture. My impression was that it probably drew the most liberal, left wing
                    elements of the international community into it. I was assigned there as the
                    political officer. We had the permanent representative who was a gentlemen by
                    the name of Pierre Graham, an excellent Foreign Service Officer and we had a
                    member of the UNESCO executive board who was Ambassador Katie Louchheim. My
                    responsibilities were on the program side. I had the cultural programs, the
                    communications programs, I had relations with non-governmental organizations. As
                    far as contacts with other delegations I focused on the East Asian delegations,
                    but I did have relations with all of the delegations. In those days we were very
                    much in the Cold War so as a political officer in all the meetings we had to
                    take into consideration unfortunately the Cold War elements. Every time we voted
                    on a meeting we had to consider which China was going to be represented in the
                    meeting, which Korea, which East Germany, which Cambodia. One side would attack
                    and the other side would respond. In fact I suggested once to the Romanian
                    delegate that we just do a prerecording and play it while we had coffee because
                    it was something of a ritual. In the beginning of those days we still had our
                    embassy in Taipei and we were concerned about the votes on representation with
                    China. I had to make sure all the delegates were around and knew that we were
                    going to have a vote on the Chinese question. I had an unfortunate task when we
                    finally did switch sides. I was asked by my boss to go down and inform the
                    Taiwanese ambassador. That was one of the iciest meetings I've ever experienced.
                    My heart wasn't in it, but it was my job and I did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who was the head of UNESCO at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: The director general of UNESCO, the head of the secretariat was a
                    gentleman by the name of Rene Maheu, a Frenchman. He was reasonably cooperative
                    with the United States and with the United States interests. During my time
                    there his term was to expire and he had been there quite some time and the
                    question arose as to who would replace him. I can remember we discussed at the
                    time Mr. M'Bow who came from West Africa. I believe from Senegal. I wasn't
                    terribly enthusiastic about Mr. M'Bow . I was the only one from the delegation
                    who was reluctant. I was supporting a gentleman by the name of Gardner from
                    Ghana. We were pretty well agreed that it probably should be somebody from
                    Africa. I wanted an Anglophone. We had a long dose of Francophone leadership. I
                    just thought Mr. Gardner would be a good change. I was convinced by my boss, and
                    we had a very free discussion about this, that this Mr. M'Bow would have a
                    better chance of being elected. We didn't want somebody who was going to be
                    sympathetic with the communist side. Eventually we went along with the consensus
                    and Mr. M'Bow was elected, but didn't pan out very well. There was a lot of
                    criticism of him during his tenure. I wasn't there and I really can't comment on
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that UNESCO, you mentioned, when you
                        get into things dealing with culture and education, there very definitely is
                        a what you call a French approach. You know, highly controlled, a great deal
                        of emphasis on the French language often enough. Did you find this permeated
                        UNESCO while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: They certainly encouraged things French, there was no doubt about
                    that. One of my tasks in the communications area was monitoring the question of
                    freedom of information recall. There was a great deal of support from the
                    developing world, from the communist bloc and from even many of our friends in
                    Europe for some sort of media standards which we viewed with some suspicion
                    because it moved very much toward censorship. In that one area we had a lot of
                    debate on adopting an international code of conduct. I've forgotten the name of
                    it. Of course they drummed on aspects of wanting to outlaw pornography and
                    racism. What they wanted to do was be able to have control of the other side and
                    we were in favor of freedom of expression. On cultural things, it just amazed me
                    all the time no matter what kind of subject you would raise, somebody would come
                    up with a political angle to it. I found myself embroiled in cultural things.
                    The Arabs were forever raising questions about Israeli abuse of Arab religious
                    and cultural sites. We had these constant storms where we often found ourselves
                    as the only supporter of the Israeli delegation. Even the Europeans backed away
                    from some of these things. I can remember the Israelis did tend to take us for
                    granted and I can remember one time that we abstained on a vote against them and
                    their ambassador came in shaking his finger at our permanent delegate saying
                    that he would report us to Jerusalem because we had voted against them. I can't
                    remember what the particular issue was. So, we had these many political fights
                    over cultural things and over educational things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the '69 to '73, you were there during the
                        first half of the Nixon administration. Was there an attitude at that time?
                        Later UNESCO became sort of a focal point of sort of American frustration
                        against international affairs, thanks to Mr. M'Bow I think, but was there
                        much of that at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, while I was there we withdrew from the ILO (International Labour
                    Organization). That had been triggered as I recall it by the fact that the ILO
                    membership had decided to elect a Soviet deputy director and that so incensed
                    our labor leadership that they advocated our withdrawal and we did in fact
                    withdraw. But, I used that occasion to emphasize to many of the members of the
                    secretariat of UNESCO and some of the other delegations that this could happen
                    in UNESCO as well, that they could not continue to ignore our views on things if
                    they wanted us to stay. I can remember in particular talking with the Japanese
                    on this subject. They were very surprised when I expressed the view that someday
                    we would leave if things continued on what I regarded as somewhat of a downhill
                    slope. We also had complaints about getting greater American participation in
                    the secretariat. We had a great deal of trouble getting Americans accepted in
                    the secretariat. I had a perhaps exaggerated view of the secretariat's
                    membership. I used to describe them as European intellectuals, the Soviet KGB
                    members and American Quakers. Oh, and Third World son-in-laws of government
                    officials. We would go to these meetings and listen to a tirade against the rich
                    nations by the developing world. Then I'd get in my old broken down 404 Chevy
                    and drive off and the African delegations would all get in their shiny new
                    Mercedes chauffeur driven and leave the meeting. This was always a bizarre
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it would strike me that UNESCO would be a place to
                        put your, you mentioned European intellectuals in a place that would bury
                        them, you know, get them out of everybody's hair. The intellectual climate
                        at that time was sort of socialist circles, which was sort of the stomping
                        ground of the intellectuals, was anti-American. I would think this would be
                        a good place to sort of beat up on us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, well they certainly took every occasion. I was used to wearing
                    flak jackets fortunately, and I needed them in this place. I can recall talking
                    about putting people there to get them out of the way. We had an executive board
                    member from the Ivory Coast named Dodier. The Ivory Coast is generally very
                    sympathetic. They had warm relations with the United States at that time, but
                    Mr. Dodier invariably voted with the communist bloc. We complained back to
                    Washington who in turn complained to Abidjan, but we never could do anything
                    about Mr. Dodier. So, you had this phenomenon that even representatives of
                    countries that were usually friendly with the United States sometimes turned
                    against us.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Let me mention an experience I had in the communications sector. UNESCO put out a
                    magazine. They did a study on the arms race and arms reduction and sales in the
                    world. I was responsible for the media and the magazine department. I discovered
                    just by chance, they would put out this magazine in Spanish, English, French and
                    Russian. I think eventually it may have come out in Arabic. I don't speak
                    Russian. But I happened to notice that the Russian articles looked shorter. We
                    checked it out. This magazine was published in the Soviet Union and the Russians
                    extracted all the statements in the article describing any Eastern Bloc weapons
                    production or sales. The article made it appear like we, the West, were the only
                    manufacturers of arms and the only seller of arms in the world. So, we had a big
                    row over that in the UNESCO magazine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was American interest in UNESCO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, we did want to participate in preserving important cultural
                    places, in fostering education especially in the developing world and fostering
                    exchanges. In having exchanges in science and in developing science especially
                    in the developing world. So, we were very sympathetic to this and we
                    contributed. We were the principal donors at UNESCO. We paid the largest fee and
                    we did support many projects. We were very much involved in Egypt with the
                    preservation of Abu Simbel. The Nubian tombs if I recall correctly. I remember
                    while I was there the question of the preservation and restoration of Borobudur
                    in Indonesia came up and we were very interested in that. In Peru there was
                    Machu Picchu. We were interested in supporting them. So, I felt there were many
                    constructive things that could be done and we were perfectly happy to support,
                    but invariably the other side would bring up political issues. We did not
                    instigate political fights in this place. We spent much of our time
                    defending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel from Washington I mean how to conduct
                        these fights or did they say okay, pick a fight on this or do this or that
                        or was this all sort of reflexive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, our positions were generally just an echo of whatever we were
                    saying in the general assembly in New York or the security council. So, it was
                    pretty impressive. There were some also practical things. We were very
                    supportive of UNESCO copyright works. Of course our publishers were interested
                    in copyright and there's a universal copyright convention with UNESCO. I helped
                    to introduce a proposal for the protection of phonograms of recordings. UNESCO
                    also got involved with the convention of universal property. This was another
                    practical matter that we were involved with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Third World, particularly
                        talking about Africa and some of these poorer countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: The main issue that the African delegations were always bringing up
                    was the question of South Africa. They would always bang the drum on apartheid.
                    We had a big investigation of non-governmental organizations. There were several
                    hundred non-governmental organizations that were associated with UNESCO. There
                    was an investigation of all these organizations. There was pressure brought to
                    bear on them to either expel their South African members or to be expelled out
                    of UNESCO. I thought they dedicated themselves to a lot of this kind of thing
                    and there was not a lot of energy coming out of the developing world for
                    development programs. There wasn't any great deal of interest. We felt
                    disappointed. There were field programs. The secretariat proposed them and they
                    were in the budget. But UNESCO didn't have a lot of funds for field projects.
                    The UNDP, the UN development program people, would put up funding for these
                    budget items and we'd provide experts. We supported these kinds of things and I
                    think we would have certainly preferred that kind of positive approach rather
                    than beating political drums all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the administrative apparatus
                        of UNESCO because this is something that you often see that the UN has been
                        under the power of Americans for a long time and what was your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, there was obviously a lot of politics involved. All the
                    delegations were pushing for representation in the secretariat for various
                    reasons. I must say that we wanted to have Americans in to be able to influence
                    the development of democracy and freedom of speech. But we also emphasized
                    having really qualified experts in the fields of science and communication. In
                    the Third World there was a lot of pushing to get people's relatives in. That
                    was unfortunate. I realize there's a certain amount of practical politics the
                    director general had to engage in. He would give out jobs like any politician
                    and in exchange for that he got support of his budget and his programs. So,
                    there was that element. I suppose that element is present in the relationship of
                    the governors in our States with the President. You had to accept that. There
                    was also a problem with the Soviets using these UN positions for inserting KGB
                    officers. We knew there were KGB officers in UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would a KGB officer be doing I mean was this just a
                        place to hang his hat while he went off and did other things? Was he messing
                        around in UNESCO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, yes, but I'm sure the objective was not with the secretariat.
                    They would just be using that as a base. The irony of it is we would participate
                    in their pay. My understanding is that if a KGB officer got assigned to UNESCO
                    he had to live off UNESCO pay. He didn't get paid by the KGB. So, we were
                    funding their espionage operations. In fact while I was there the Soviets sent
                    as their permanent delegate a very senior KGB officer who had been PNGed out of
                    Canada for operating a spy ring. Of course, that's in the Soviet delegation and
                    not in the secretariat. He was well known for running his operation and
                    collecting a ton of secrets from the United States using people in Canada. When
                    the Canadians caught up with him, they threw him out. The Soviets made him the
                    head of the UNESCO delegation. That gives you something of the flavor. But we
                    had very good cooperation with the Soviets in areas where we could cooperate. We
                    spoke to each other regularly. We had a very professional, cordial even at times
                    I would say personally friendly relationship. This was surprising. When I
                    arrived at UNESCO the U.S. permanent delegate had a reception for me in the
                    first week to introduce me to people in the other delegations. The head Soviet
                    delegate left his own reception which he was giving the same night just to call
                    on our party and to introduce himself to me. So, we did have some common
                    concerns. The Eastern Bloc did oppose the expansion of the UNESCO budget all the
                    time. So there was a very strange phenomenon that on budget issues affecting
                    developed countries, the Eastern Bloc would be voting on one side and the
                    developing world, Africa and South Asia would be voting on the other. I would
                    often discuss with the Russians what we would do about particular budget
                    proposals. We also from time to time would tell the Russians that we were going
                    to blast them on something. I can remember the Czech who sat next to me in one
                    of the meetings. He would send me messages that this speaker talks more than my
                    mother-in-law and things like that. But he and I would always vote against on
                    opposite sides. We certainly exchanged lots of stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of major issues or real major clashes,
                        did Zionism or racism, was that an issue in UNESCO or did that come up
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: That was perhaps one of our most difficult issues. There were always
                    initiatives of one kind or another attacking the Israelis in just about every
                    program, in trying to exclude the Israelis, in trying to put paragraphs in
                    various resolutions condemning Israel. While I was there we also normalized our
                    relations with Egypt. That was interesting. We started having our first meetings
                    with the Egyptians, but even so we had a lot of difficulty, probably more over
                    Israel than anything else that I can think of.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, but not as a major issue. The Eastern Bloc didn't really push
                    Vietnam. They didn't waste a lot of time. The issues that were contentious were
                    raised by the developing world, by the Arabs over Israel, and by the Africans
                    over South Africa. They wanted to exclude South Africa from everything. It
                    wouldn't necessarily be in everyone's interest to exclude them from things like
                    copyright agreements. That would just give them free rein to pirate everybody
                    else's stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do countries like Taiwan and Thailand respond to
                        copyright moves since these are the prime sources of pirated books and
                        records and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I don't recall it being a problem with Thailand. I think Thailand
                    probably gave lip service to copyright support. They might not have enforced it
                    at home. When we were forming this copyright convention I very much wanted
                    Taiwan to be a member. This was not acceptable to the Beijing government when
                    they came in. I don't know if this would have played much of a role anyhow. I
                    think Taipei's view on copyright was that this stuff was only for home
                    consumption and for students. They had some sort of formula that wasn't really
                    realistic. In reality it didn't work out very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the social life in Paris at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Oh, you had an endless number of events. I can remember going to
                    dinner and three cocktail parties in the same evening. I really got tired of it.
                    Towards the end of my tour I just tried to not go unless I really had to see
                    somebody or accomplish something. Cocktail parties are a great way of lobbying
                    for something. If I had something on the agenda I'd go to a cocktail party and
                    push for a vote or participation or something to get people to support our side
                    on something. I was very interested in doing that. But if it was just another
                    cocktail party and there wasn't any practical objective, I tended in the last
                    year to shy away from them. I'd just had too many. In fact, you'll see I
                    eventually volunteered to return to Vietnam because I felt that this whole thing
                    was getting boring.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, one of my neighbors, Jim Rosenthal, was a member of the
                    delegation at the peace talks and there were other people I did meet with. We
                    did social things together. I did speak a lot with the Vietnamese delegation in
                    UNESCO. They were a smaller community, so they were pretty close to what was
                    happening in Paris. So, I did from time to time have some view of what was
                    developing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I don't recall any kind of negative views. I think the Vietnamese
                    delegation was very appreciative of our support for them. I personally was very
                    interested in them and I never got any critical comments. I must say the
                    Vietnamese that were sent there were very articulate, the South Vietnamese were
                    very intelligent officers. When the Vietnamese question did come up, they were
                    very good at addressing it and very capable. This contrast with the Koreans.
                    When the Koreans got criticized, they would take it as a frontal assault. They'd
                    go into a counter diatribe. The Vietnamese were much more sophisticated. They
                    would respond in a very evenhanded intellectual manner and I was very impressed
                    by this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you're saying towards the end of this, by '73 it's

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Well, at that time when we signed the agreement, the peace
                    accords, they were looking for officers to monitor the transition. I happened to
                    talk to personnel on the phone and said that I wasn't going to volunteer because
                    that would cause some problems at home and in the delegation perhaps, but if I
                    were drafted I wouldn't oppose going. So, not surprisingly, we got a telegram
                    asking that I be transferred back to Vietnam.</p>

                    think it had a great deal of impact on the programs of UNESCO at the time. The
                    budget chief of the UNESCO secretariat was Chinese. He suddenly had a PRC task
                    force and he came to me and said, “You know, I wish to be invited to the PRC
                    cocktail parties if that could be arranged.” I declined the offer. They were
                    very active in coming around and meeting everyone. I remember the director
                    general made a trip to China. There was a lot of fanfare. There was a lot of
                    discussion about the back dues owed by China and how that was going to be
                    resolved. I think we forgave their debt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when M'Bow took over, what was his
                        impression of his style?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: He took over just before I left and I really didn't get an opportunity
                    to make a fair assessment. He was a very friendly, outgoing kind of man. He
                    reminded me more of a French politician than anything else. The Africans in
                    fact, one of my African friends told me that he thought his father was really a
                    Frenchman and not an African. I don't know if that was just a story to spread
                    about enemies or whether there was any truth to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, back to Vietnam. You went where and you were there
                        for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Well, I returned in the summer of '73. I was initially assigned
                    on temporary duty for six months with the task of monitoring the peace accords.
                    I was assigned back to the third corps. I asked to be assigned back to the third
                    corps because I knew that area and I'd wanted to see how things had gone since
                    my departure and that's where most of my Vietnamese contacts were. Political
                    officers don't have friends, they have contacts. Anyhow, they were very good
                    about assigning me there. CORDS, the development program had been abolished and
                    had been replaced by a consulate general, four consulates general and I was
                    assigned to a consulate general in Bien Hoa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Walt Crenshaw. He was a labor specialist. He was there I guess for
                    about six months. My TDY more or less coincided with that period. Just an
                    amusing point: when I arrived at the Bien Hoa airport, they forgot to send
                    somebody to get me. So, I had to hitchhike. There was no transportation from the
                    airport in any commercial vehicle, so I had to hitchhike to the embassy. I got a
                    ride by some army chaplain who happened to be traveling by. When I got to the
                    embassy they were very red-faced. There was an administrative officer by the
                    name of Bob McCallum who had been assigned to take care of me. Mr. McCallum had
                    the misfortune of then being assigned to me later on and I have never let him
                    forget that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you were in Vietnam in Bien Hoa for half of '73
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, well, then after my TDY assignment, they made me political
                    officer in effect the deputy consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Bien Hoa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In Bien Hoa. So, I went on home leave because I hadn't taken home
                    leave yet. Then when I came back I came back as a permanent officer.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Bien Hoa from '73 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: To the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: To '75. I left off the roof of the embassy the evening of April
                    29th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you got there what was the situation in the
                        third corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: There was sporadic fighting still in almost all the provinces. We had
                    skirmishes. My principal job was preparing a daily situation summary that we
                    sent in as did all the consulates general saying what had happened in the last
                    24 hours. We sent this in everyday. The first task I had in the morning to put
                    this thing together. I was just one of the five persons who did this. We went
                    out to the different provinces. In the third corps there were about 10 or 12
                    provinces. We had AID officers. We had a presence in every province. So, we
                    would talk to them on the radio or on the telephone if there was such a thing.
                    We then would put together where the attacks were through this day, how many
                    hand grenades were thrown and how many casualties and just monitoring the
                    behavior. We tracked the continued violations by the communist forces of the
                    peace agreement. That's what we did for six months. I traveled all over. I saw
                    all the provinces. I saw old friends and majors who had become colonels and that
                    kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a great degree of cynicism among you all or
                        during the monitoring of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, well it was very clear that the communist had no intention
                    whatsoever of maintaining any kind of cease-fire. So, we tried to support the
                    local people, the local forces and hoped that they were able to consolidate
                    their position. We didn't have any military of course. Our teams were changed.
                    We couldn't rely on any American forces. The military presence was just the
                    defense attach�'s office, which was engaged principally in Saigon in logistics
                    support. But each consulate general had a defense attach� office. They had hired
                    contractors to run their offices and these were military intelligence collection
                    operations. I personally felt they were somewhat amateurish. We also had the CIA
                    present and they had about four or five officers in Bien Hoa. They had what was
                    called a base chief at the consulate general. There was a gentleman by the name
                    of Orrin DeForest who was the CIA operative there who has written a book called
                    Slow Burn so I'm not saying anything that isn't already published. We also had
                    another CIA officer who wrote critical articles for the Post. So all that was
                    far more documented than what I am going to describe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the Republic of Vietnam, South Vietnamese
                        government. How were they responding to these attacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: They would try to consolidate their position. They would try to build
                    up their strength and the training of their forces. They would try to protect
                    the communities. There wasn't any major offensive of any kind, it was trying to
                    consolidate and improve what you had. I thought they had for the most part very
                    good officers. I met all the province chiefs in the third corps. They had
                    meetings every Monday with the commanding general of the third corps and his
                    staff. He had two deputies, two brigadiers I guess. They were very professional.
                    I was very impressed by the quality of the officers that they had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we making any attempt to stop the South Vietnamese to
                        responding to attacks by the North Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, certainly if the North Vietnamese initiated any actions in the
                    third corps the southern forces were free to get rid of them. They weren't
                    supposed to be there. I can't speak about anything outside the third corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was happening in Phuoc Long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Phuoc Long. My friend, the district chief, Major Yen, had become the
                    province chief. He was then a colonel. Unfortunately one still had to fly to
                    Phuoc Long. The road was still very dangerous to drive though I understood they
                    did start some sort of bus operation. I did go up there. I used to stay there
                    overnight. I loved the place. I didn't want to convey the impression before that
                    it was a place where I didn't want to be in. It was beautiful. The country
                    itself was beautiful. Southeast Asia in general is more beautiful in the
                    countryside than it is in the cities. Phuoc Long really was a collection of
                    refugee villages. The Montagnards grew highland rice and they lived on it. There
                    wasn't a great deal of industry. They cut bamboo shoots into other things, but
                    it wasn't rattan. They didn't have a lot of things. We had helped build a
                    Montagnard training center, sort of an orphanage. I used to go up and bring them
                    powdered milk for baby formula. There were some nuns up there that helped train
                    Montagnards to do things, teach them handiwork and sewing and that kind of
                    stuff. So, Phuoc Long was at that time when I returned in '73 was reasonably
                    stable and seemed to be getting along without the presence of the American
                    military. We hadn't lost any of the district capitals and I felt very secure in
                    Song Be itself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now I assume one of your jobs in the military, I
                        mean this whole intelligence apparatus sounds like they, everybody must have
                        been almost tripping over each other on this, but one of the things you'd be
                        doing would be monitoring the spirit of the ARV. How is the, what was your
                        impression when you got down to the change of the South Vietnamese
                        army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: As far as tripping over each other, we had lots of jurisdictional
                    problems with the CIA and the defense attach� people. But, as far as the ARV was
                    concerned, well we had regular forces. We had regional forces, RF they were
                    called. PF popular forces something like a militia. Initially when I was there
                    the morale was pretty good. They had a lot of support logistically. There was
                    some optimism, but there was certainly an awareness that support for the war was
                    eroding in the United States. That was a concern by everybody including the
                    ambassador. Our ambassador was Graham Martin at the time. I must say that the
                    entire time I was in Bien Hoa in the third corps, I'm not aware that the
                    ambassador ever entered our consular district. His wife came for lunch once, but
                    he never came. We had a very fine leadership in the third corps on the
                    Vietnamese side. We had three major divisions in the northeast we had the 18th
                    division, which was ably commanded. He was an extraordinary officer, very
                    impressive. He used to entertain his troops, he'd play the electric guitar and
                    sing rock and roll. Oh, he could do everything. He was a very dynamic,
                    charismatic figure and proved to be so until the very end. He was in the area of
                    Xuan Loc, which is route one going northeast, and then directly north of us we
                    had another division. I think it was the seventh. That was a difficult area. Loc
                    Binh was there on route 13. That command seemed to be well run. Then we had
                    another division, the 25th division, on route one going toward Cambodia. The
                    25th division commander, General Ba, who was one of the biggest Vietnamese I
                    ever saw. He was certainly over six feet and also a very inspiring guy. I think
                    they all had a very positive attitude.</p>
                <p>One of the cynical observations I had heard while I was there was that well you
                    know these generals who run Saigon have to be selected for political loyalty
                    rather than for their competence as commanding generals. I certainly didn't find
                    that to be the case. They may well have been loyal to President Thieu, but they
                    were certainly competent commanders. My impression was that they were highly
                    respected by their fellow officers, by their staff, and by the province chiefs
                    who were all military officers. So, I thought we had a very good team and I had
                    a very good relationship with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did things start to go downhill? I mean what were you
                        seeing when you talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I think as things progressed there was an erosion of our
                    support. This led to questioning about how long we were going to give them stuff
                    and how much we would give them, arguments over the budget and all this kind of
                    thing. It projected the idea that we wanted to get out and then we had the
                    unfortunate Watergate business, which I think really hurt us. This distracted
                    the nation. I think it was a big problem for Vietnam. There was corruption in
                    the military. My friend, Colonel Yen used to tell me about this. He eventually
                    became province chief of Bien Hoa so I saw him quite a bit since we lived in the
                    same town. He would tell me about the problems with what we called ghost
                    soldiers and flower soldiers and units. In these units if a man was dead or gone
                    that they continued to collect his pay and rations and not replace him. Flower
                    soldiers were enlisted and were actually members of a unit, but were allowed to
                    go home. They collected their pay and rations as well. Colonel Yen used to tell
                    me about surprise inspections on weekends. How in the boondocks they would
                    muster and count everybody and call to account why people were missing. He
                    wanted to see the paperwork. So, undoubtedly there were problems and everyone
                    admitted that, but certainly not any worse than things I've seen in other parts
                    of the world including the United States. I felt that the Vietnamese forces had
                    competence as long they felt they could count on our support. Over the two years
                    I was there they started to doubt whether they could rely on us anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were developments that you were seeing towards the
                        end in '75? I mean were you seeing, was there a steady decline or was it
                        rather fast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: The skirmishes, the incursions increased. Particularly the North
                    Vietnamese came in the area around route 13 to the north of Saigon and there was
                    quite a bit of fighting there. The North Vietnamese must have taken a lot of
                    casualties there, but they hung on and they kept some enclaves. The real test
                    was ironically over my old province Phuoc Long. In January of '75 they mounted a
                    major operation against Phuoc Long.</p>
                <p>Six months into my job Walter Shaw left and Richard Peters who had been the
                    political military chief in Saigon became the consul general. I was in effect
                    his deputy. He was on leave at this point. I can recall there was a lot of
                    pressure on Phuoc Long. I can remember going to the weekly meeting of the full
                    commander and I knew we were in trouble when he felt like he was being
                    overwhelmed in Song Be. He turned to me and said, “What should we do?” I had
                    this terrible feeling that if he was asking me what to do then we didn't have a
                    very good chance. I felt and I wrote that I felt that this was a test. They were
                    going to take Phuoc Long and if they could get away with that and if there would
                    be no American reaction that they knew they could do what they wished. In fact
                    that's what happened. In fact, after the war, the general who commanded the
                    invasion wrote an article in the Vietnamese press saying that that was the case.
                    So, I felt quite vindicated on that. Song Be was the first capital to fall and
                    they were able to take it. After that we were very concerned and then the
                    activities started in the second corps which really caused the unraveling of
                    everything.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in the highlands up around Pleiku?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. We, as far as I understand, we didn't understand that they were
                    going to attack. They moved some divisions and we were tracking them with signal
                    intelligence according to what's been published. They were smart enough to know
                    that we were doing that and so they didn't move their radios, they just moved
                    their army. We had human intelligence saying there was going to be an attack,
                    which we ignored and the signal intelligence showed that they hadn't moved. They
                    attacked. The roads became flooded with refugees fleeing and the whole second
                    corps caved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this was happening, what were you all doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, we were just monitoring events in our own area. We were very
                    concerned about any assaults that might take place. We were certainly looking at
                    our evacuation plans and we weren't very optimistic about it. After Song Be fell
                    I thought we were going to lose.</p>
                <p>I remember General Weyand and some fact finding group came in. Ken Quinn, who was
                    later our ambassador to Cambodia, was with them. I told them that I thought we
                    would collapse by August. I was wrong, I didn't realize how much of a botch they
                    would make out of the first corps. Things were really very bad there. We had
                    troops moving both up and down the road at the same time. It was just a terrible
                    mess. When the first corps fell we managed to evacuate the marines. The marines
                    were evacuated and the families were left under the communists, which was a
                    terrible situation. I was very concerned because they brought those marines into
                    our corps and they were placed under the 18th division under General Dao and I
                    didn't regard them as very reliable. Da Nang falling was a big shock for us. We
                    had scenes of people desperate to get out of Da Nang and people forcing their
                    way onto aircraft or helicopters at gunpoint and fleeing by sea. There was a lot
                    of violence. We saw that and that impacted on our evacuation plan. We were very
                    concerned that if we had to evacuate the Bien Hoa area we would have encountered
                    the same kind of problems where people, armed units would try to take over the
                    means of transportation. As a matter of fact that never happened. What we didn't
                    understand, was that in Da Nang people were fleeing from the first corps to try
                    to get down to Saigon and what was left of Vietnam. Most of the people in
                    Vietnam when the end came, weren't that interested in leaving.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We had these evacuation planning sessions called by the security officer, a
                    gentleman named Mark Garrett who was really a fine officer, a very capable guy
                    and the backbone to the whole security business. I must say he kept his focus
                    while everybody else and many other people were running around in circles. We
                    discussed these problems. We were very concerned if we started initiating an
                    evacuation that the army units could turn on us. There was this feeling that we
                    might be in the ironic position of having to rely on communist troops to protect
                    us against our former allies. Da Nang inspired this kind of thinking. We were
                    particularly concerned about this marine regiment that was under the 18th, that
                    was very close to the consulate general in Bien Hoa. When things went downhill,
                    the first corps had to really decide about what we were going to do. The
                    ambassador was just dead-set against any discussion publicly or any indication
                    that we might leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the attitude of the ambassador pretty well known? Was
                        it talked about that he was out of touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I wouldn't use the word out of touch. My impression was that the
                    attitude of the ambassador was that he wanted to hang on, that he didn't want to
                    cause panic. I don't know if he imagined that we were going to have some sort of
                    a commendation or that he was going to get the government, the American
                    government, to finally support him. I think he was unrealistic. I think it was a
                    hopeless case. I thought they had passed that stage. There just didn't seem to
                    be any reason to believe that there would be much forthcoming from the United
                    States. I think a feeling developed among the South Vietnamese forces that they
                    didn't want to be the last soldier to die in a hopeless war. Once you get that
                    feeling, it's very serious. The communist forces started coming down out of
                    route 20, down from the Xuan Loc area and Major General Le Minh Dao was there to
                    meet them. He was courageous. He decimated many of their people at the cost of
                    at least a third of the division. He held for a long time. All of these
                    divisions, all the generals had helicopters.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The evacuation finally took place on the 28th or 29th of April. They could have
                    easily have gone out to the Blue Ridge or to any of the ships there at sea. None
                    of them did. They all stayed. So much for the feeling that they weren't going to
                    fight. The three army divisions fought. General Dao and General Ba were captured
                    and the division commander of the staff swore that he would fight to the last
                    minute. They didn't surrender. They were captured. I saw an article written by
                    Dao later in the communist press, which were very cleverly written saying how he
                    was disappointed at the United States. I said to myself, I'm sure you would have
                    appreciated the return of the U.S. army. Nothing he said changed my view of him.
                    I had met him several months before the end. He had a very bad eye problem which
                    was threatening his sight. I think he had a detached retina. Anyhow we had him
                    looked at and it was agreed that he could be evacuated to Hawaii for medical
                    treatment. But when things deteriorated he gave up leaving and wanted to fight
                    with his division. So he was captured. I don't know if he is still alive today,
                    but he could have spent all that time in Hawaii if he chose to. [ed note. Le
                    Minh Dao spent 17 years in a re-education camp. After his release, he received
                    political asylum in the United States.] So, obviously these people, the South
                    Vietnamese forces that did most of the dying in the war were in the end really
                    quite courageous. They never were given the credit that they deserved.</p>
                <p>Let me cite Frank Snepp's book, A Decent Interval. There are all kinds of
                    imaginings in his account of these chaotic events. He has the details wrong.
                    Everything that he said about the third corps was wrong. He claimed that when we
                    left Bien Hoa that the South Vietnamese army fired on us, which was absolutely
                    untrue. I was there and it never happened. He claimed that we had asked for
                    helicopter gunships, hundreds. We never did such a thing. We never even
                    considered such a thing. I was concerned that if we withdrew from Bien Hoa that
                    they may have indeed fired on us if we had asked for such support. In fact they
                    never did and we never asked them for support. When it looked bad the embassy
                    arranged that we had these landing crafts sent to Bien Hoa up the Dong Nai
                    River.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Snepp, in his book, described that the CIA was somehow involved in arranging for
                    these landing crafts and that's completely untrue. I was personally responsible
                    for them. I arranged for the landing craft to be anchored at a naval station on
                    the Dong Nai River. I told that to the Vietnamese naval commander there. In fact
                    I met him in the refugee camp later and he reminded me how cooperative he had
                    been with us on the barge issue. We kept these barges and they would have
                    certainly been enough to take our staff and our dependents including the
                    Vietnamese. We had ten of them and they were huge. Anyhow, eventually we were
                    instructed by Saigon to release the barges and that if we were going to have an
                    evacuation that we would go by air. At this stage the 18th corps was still
                    stopping the advance of the main enemy force. The forces were coming down from
                    the northeast. Every time the road was closed, the 25th division under General
                    Ba reopened it which I thought was amazing. I was impressed by this
                    tremendously. We had a break in coordination. Typically we had a lot of AID
                    officers under the consulate general. The AID director in Saigon started giving
                    instructions to our AID people. So we had our AID officers being told at one
                    stage that they were going to be taken out by boat and then I was given orders
                    to move the staff to Saigon. I sent word to them and said, no, that's the wrong
                    place. We'd move to a building called USAID 2 and we'll meet there and we will
                    arrange for an air evacuation. Let me back track. The moment all of this was
                    happening, DAO, the defense attach�'s office, was Homer Smith who was in Saigon.
                    He was the senior military officer there. They quietly closed and they withdrew
                    from the provinces. What we didn't know, they never told us. I thought they were
                    all going into Saigon. We arranged unilaterally to have aircraft take the
                    defense attach�s back, including the Vietnamese and their dependents, to the
                    Philippines. We did this without the ambassador's authorization or without the
                    permission of the Philippine government or as far as I know without the
                    permission of the Defense Department. What they did was they would draw out
                    their staff piecemeal. They had all of these big containers from the commissary
                    in Saigon. Our political staff people loaded the people into these containers.
                    Then they put the containers on a truck and they shut them and put them in an
                    Air Force cargo plane. They got most of their staff out that way without anybody
                    including the ambassador knowing about it. I understand finally some Vietnamese
                    secretary managed to get to a phone and called her mother somehow. She got
                    through to her mother and said, “Guess what? We're now in the Philippines and
                    all you have to do is go down to the commissary and get yourself in a
                    container.” Anyhow, the word spread quickly, that all these Vietnamese were in
                    the Philippines. I understand that the ambassador was quite upset. I don't have
                    any personal witness to that but Homer Smith was fired after that. We had to
                    explain to the Philippine government how we had brought many thousands of
                    Vietnamese into the Philippines without the agreement of the Philippine
                    government. That was an event. Anyhow in the meantime I was very concerned about
                    getting the American community out. Then our staff which had worked for us for
                    many years and their dependents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Vietnamese staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: The Vietnamese staff. As regards the American community, I'd had a
                    consular officer go around to all the American civilians we knew were there and
                    notified them to please leave. The Americans had no problem leaving if they
                    wished. We were running flights out of Bien Hoa and they could go with their
                    dependents. We arranged for passports and visas for dependents, wives and
                    children of the Americans. In the third corps absolutely anybody who stayed in
                    the third corps after the first of April was there because they wanted to be
                    there regardless of what they said after. We had one fellow who was working in a
                    Vietnamese mental hospital and he elected to stay and the Vietnamese eventually
                    threw him out. Then we had some contractors who just couldn't give up the good
                    life. The contractors maintained aircraft and that kind of thing. We did ship
                    home a few wives and children who were basically Vietnamese. Sometimes the
                    Americans were already gone, but we had the weddings recorded in the consular
                    section and we had documented the children. On a couple of occasions the wives
                    and children went to the States to meet the husband and his American wife and
                    children, but that wasn't my problem. That happened, too. So, on the evacuation
                    front, the Americans weren't a major problem. But what was a problem was what we
                    were going to do about the Vietnamese staff and their families. The ambassador
                    seemed very, very hesitant to make a decision and then he was obsessed with this
                    idea of peace. I was very upset about this whole issue. Finally we were given
                    permission to start moving the Vietnamese staff. We all met in this building in
                    Saigon. We were told to pass the word to the staff in Bien Hoa, both provinces
                    came down. They were in Bien Hoa and they all moved to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go, by helicopter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No. When we left Bien Hoa we drove in a convoy, but the Vietnamese
                    made it whatever way they could into Saigon because they were coming from Phuoc
                    Long. The staff that had been in Phuoc Long were already there in Bien Hoa from
                    the various provinces around Saigon. There was a coordinating group there. A
                    USAID officer named Anderson was given the job of coordinating the evacuation of
                    the Vietnamese staff. Each one of us represented our corps. We'd get space, each
                    corps was given so much space and then they were asked to allot their space to
                    designate who was going to be on that aircraft. I called the Vietnamese staff of
                    the first corps together and I told them that I was going to evacuate people
                    based on who had been in the most dangerous places and who politically were the
                    most liable to be dealt with harshly by the communists. I asked if anybody had
                    any objections or any other ideas. They all seemed to accept my approach. Our
                    policy was that staff members and their families could go and children under the
                    age of 18. You couldn't take out boys of military age. That was the rule. You
                    could take out their mothers and fathers. So, we started moving them and taking
                    them out to the airport. We had to load them aboard. I had a lot of difficulty
                    at one point. My admin officer fled. He was an American. He got on the airplane
                    without telling me. From what I understand he got his wife on the airplane and
                    she wouldn't leave without him, so he felt he had to go. I didn't have his
                    records. I didn't know the pay situation and I didn't even know whether he was
                    dead or alive. He could have been captured. So I was worried about this. He
                    certainly didn't help any. He got out. The CIA base chief went as well and he
                    left his staff hanging in the forest. His associates did very well and they
                    stayed in Bien Hoa. I understand his excuse was that he was afraid that his wife
                    would have a nervous breakdown. She was in Bangkok, so he had to leave. He was
                    later made the head of some important industry somewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>It was interesting to see how people behave in this situation. Anyhow, back in
                    USAID 2, we were trying to divvy up the evacuees. Things came to a sudden stop.
                    I had all my guards show up. We had about 100 guards and they were armed with
                    clubs. These fellows didn't want us to leave. They wanted to get paid. The
                    administrative officer took care of all this. We had bags of piasters. I'd been
                    given a suitcase full of piasters when we rode on buses and when we came to
                    roadblocks we had these piasters to give to police at the roadblocks so they
                    wouldn't harass us and we'd get to go through. So, a fellow representing the
                    first corps, a fellow called Paul Dailey, tried to figure out how much he
                    thought the guards were getting. They had two months back pay. We came up with a
                    number and I had all the guards line up. We had a big list made out with all the
                    names on it and each man marched up. We gave the first two or three thousands of
                    piasters and they all smiled. So, we knew that the amount was okay, that we were
                    obviously overpaying them and so we managed to pay off all these guards with the
                    bribe money and get them out of our way. Then we could go back to arranging the
                    evacuation. One lesson I learned from the first flight: we were allotted seats
                    and I was given something like 11 seats for one family. The family didn't show
                    up. What happened was the grandmother decided she couldn't leave without her
                    sister and she didn't want to leave without her mother, whatever. So, one
                    wouldn't go and then everyone else wouldn't go and then nobody went. They all
                    just stayed behind. So, I developed a system of backups where we would either
                    say okay, you are going to meet at a certain place and each person was told who
                    was going to be there and from that location you would be loaded on a bus and
                    taken to the airport. Then we had x number of backups. The backups had to
                    understand that they would only get a seat if somebody else didn't show up. That
                    system actually worked out very well and so I didn't lose anymore seats. Thank
                    God. We were able to ship out a fair number of the staff and their families. I
                    only had, I suppose, about 60 people who wanted to leave. Some of them had
                    families and some of them didn't. I guess about half of them out. Then the
                    communist forces started the rocketing of Bien Hoa and some marines were killed.
                    So we had to close the airbase, the airport. It was too risky. So, we decided to
                    go back to the barges to evacuate the people. On the 29th I finally got word
                    that we were going to move them. It was difficult to get the word out to them
                    but we got the word to as many of them as we could find. They all went down on
                    this pier. There were probably several thousand people. We were loading them
                    into barges. I can remember there was a Vietnamese military police officer. They
                    have this emblem PC which is their MP. This was a huge guy, I think he was a
                    captain. He had medals down to his belt and he was directing traffic. It just
                    struck me how people did what they were supposed to do regardless of how
                    hopeless things were. The police were still functioning on the streets; the
                    traffic police. Things were reasonably orderly. We had this big mob down at the
                    pier. Then we were loading them onto the barges. I can remember one very good
                    province chief and his wife was there. He had two or three children, but he was
                    in uniform. He's one that I really admired, very solid and he came up to me and
                    asked if it was possible for him to get on the barge. He reached up and he
                    ripped the insignias off his uniform, dropping them over the side. That really
                    struck me. Then there was one of my local employees. After he got done loading,
                    I turned to him and said are you going to get on? He said, no, I don't want to
                    get on. I want to stay here. I took a key from one of our staff vehicles and
                    said, you can take that vehicle over there, it's yours, good luck. He got in the
                    vehicle and drove off. Then there was another little militia fellow. He had a
                    rifle and just standing there keeping order. We were just about finished and we
                    didn't have anyone else who wanted to get on the barge. I said do you want to
                    get on the barge and he just looked up at me and said, no, this is my country,
                    I'm staying here. It was very interesting and a horrible experience. Obviously I
                    was disappointed that some local employees didn't get the word and didn't get
                    down to the pier. We could have gotten everybody out. Anyhow, at that point I
                    went back to the embassy with this fellow Paul Dailey from the first corps. The
                    embassy, the streets were very quiet and very orderly and the police were still
                    functioning. There was a quietness about the place and I didn't feel the
                    hostility. But around the embassy there were a couple of thousand people. We had
                    theses big iron gates. The marines had been flown in I think from Okinawa. The
                    marines made me more nervous than anybody else because the crowds was yelling.
                    The marines didn't know whether they were going to get popped. I was afraid one
                    of them was going to shoot somebody. Anyhow, we got back into the embassy. We
                    got word that the president had ordered us to leave, everybody out by a certain
                    time on the morning of the 30th. So, there were to be no Americans by 6:00 on
                    April 30th. That came from the president. Graham Martin had asked whether people
                    would be willing to stay. I had volunteered to stay with other members of the
                    staff, but that present direction canceled that idea. A general, Big Minh, had
                    taken over as president. He was the third president in a week. I think we had
                    conveyed the message to him that we were willing to leave a skeleton staff at
                    the embassy to negotiate some sort of relationship or whatever. The communist
                    authorities got word back to him that we were to all leave. After that we closed
                    the operation. I never felt threatened by the communists. It was clear to me
                    that they were going to allow us to get out. I think that they didn't want to
                    give any cause for us not to move our forces out.. So, they had halted on the
                    outskirts, but they weren't pushing in. They were going to let us get out. It
                    was just obvious. So, I remember coming up to the gate and there was this huge
                    mob surrounding it. The only place that there was any activity. We had to figure
                    out how to get in. We had a couple of locals with us. We got the attention of
                    the marines, hey, you know, we're Americans, we're on the staff. Okay, come
                    around the gate on the side and we're going to open that gate up and we're going
                    to let you in. So, we went around to that gate. We thought at the time that we
                    might be able to get more people in, but we didn't. I can remember there was a
                    huge marine sergeant, staff sergeant or a master sergeant, he had a lot of
                    stripes and he was a big guy. They had this little side gate and he said to the
                    Vietnamese employees, you tell all the people around there that I'm going to
                    open this gate and I'm going to put my fist out and the first person to step
                    through this gate that I don't authorize is going to get this fist down his
                    throat. He's standing there with his fist drawn and we four marched in and he
                    slammed the gate shut and nobody moved near that gate. That's how we got back
                    into the compound and we went back to reporting. At this point, Mark Garrett,
                    the security officer finally struck and, without the ambassador's authorization,
                    cut down this damn tree.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That tree, I know the tree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. We got rid of this tree. They brought in this large helicopter to
                    land. The Americans were being evacuated off the top of the roof. But the
                    Vietnamese were being evacuated by these large aircraft on the ground. I went to
                    the back of the compound with Dailey. We got up on the wall and we had all these
                    marine guards on the wall. They were just kids and looking very nervous and
                    making me nervous. We looked over the wall. There was this mass of Vietnamese
                    people screaming and waving. In the crowd we recognized some of our staff. So,
                    we pulled some of them up over the wall. We told the marine guards these were
                    our employees. Then we went back and forth. We got several of them over the
                    wall. Then finally the order came down that we had to leave. There was going to
                    be a lot of turmoil. They forced us away from the wall. We went in and then
                    that's when I was told I had to leave. I really felt shitty. I felt we were
                    running away from a third rate government, a communist force. That was just
                    something I never thought I'd see in my life. So, I stayed there until they
                    finally told me I should get on a helicopter. I had some sort of a weapon. The
                    drill was to throw your weapon on a pile before you got on the helicopter. I had
                    an automatic revolver. I wasn't going to go anywhere without that thing, without
                    some sort of protection. You didn't know whether the helicopter was going to be
                    shot down. So we got onto the helicopter and I remember flying off, it was late
                    on the 29th. I remember landing on the Blue Ridge.</p>

                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. I can still remember the flight. We went over the logistics
                    centers near Bien Hoa. They were all burning. You could see the fires for miles.
                    It was very awesome. When we got out to the ship. I only had the clothes I was
                    wearing. I didn't have my passport. I didn't have any money. I had my ID card
                    and my State Department ID card and a few dollars. Just the suit I was wearing.
                    I remember they searched me when I stepped off. They extracted my automatic
                    revolver. They said I had to register it with them and could come and get it
                    some other time. I never did. I'd brought flags out from Bien Hoa. I also had
                    some piasters. I was carrying them in case we had to bribe police to let our
                    staff go. I still had the flags. I had four flags. I had them in a little
                    cellophane bag. I have them at home now and the piasters. I still have them
                    stuck somewhere at home. I went down to the war room and I saw General Ky. That
                    really upset and infuriated me. I have nothing against any Vietnamese getting
                    out, but he had been on the radio a couple of nights before calling on every
                    loyal red-blooded Vietnamese to fight the communists invaders down to the last
                    man. That no true Vietnamese would desert his country in its hour of need. I
                    wondered how many poor kids listened to this bloke out followed his advice. Then
                    he got on that helicopter and fled. I was pretty unhappy with him. On board the
                    ship I was bunked with Tom Polgar who was the CIA chief and with this woman,
                    Burke, who was the consul general in Saigon. We were all sort of stuck together
                    in this room. I was exhausted. I remember somebody shaking me and saying the
                    ambassador is flying aboard, would you like to come up on the deck? I asked him
                    sarcastically, is it washed? I still remember when the ambassador came on board.
                    He had his valet and his damn dog. Here I had lost a lot of my employees because
                    he never got around to being able to decide when to get the staff out, but he
                    could get his dog out. I tell you if I had half a chance to throw that dog over
                    the side, I would have done it. I was pretty unhappy about his dog getting on
                    and members of my staff didn't.</p>
                <p>I remember eating dinner that first night. We were eating spaghetti. I had an AID
                    officer with me, Joe Deveier, a very dedicated officer who was with the third
                    corps. Mr. Polgar joined us and he was rather bald. Polgar started to tell us
                    about the problems of this friendly police commander of the Vietnamese police
                    force. This poor police commander had left and he hadn't gotten his art
                    collection out. I had visions of spaghetti dripping down that bald head. I put
                    my arm on my friend Deveier's leg to restrain him. We quickly concluded dinner
                    and walked away. Here we had just left staff behind and this guy's worrying
                    about some guy who didn't get his art collection out. This was part of the
                    difference between the fellows in Saigon and the people out in the field. I
                    didn't feel they had proper concerns for the Vietnamese staff. I remember I had
                    one previous encounter with personnel about evacuating people. I spoke to the
                    personnel officer at the embassy before we started the evacuation. I met this
                    woman and I told her how many people we had. She said, “Oh no, you only have two
                    regular employees, regular staffers, all the rest of those people are just
                    contract.” I said, to her, “You know the communists aren't going to ask about
                    whether they were contract or not before they execute them.” This sort of
                    distinction just boggled me.</p>

                        You've talked about some of our immediate reactions towards Graham Martin

                        afterwards and how things went then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is August 8, 2000. You're on the Blue Ridge. What was sort of the word of
                    the people there?</p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: People generally were very despondent. We had Vietnamese aboard the
                    Blue Ridge as well as Americans. We realized we had just lost this long struggle
                    that many of us were so committed to. I was at a loss to understand what it
                    meant and where I was going to go at this point. The people I was with in large
                    part shared these emotions. We went from the Blue Ridge into Manila. I had no
                    clothing but what I was wearing when I got on the helicopter. We landed in the
                    Philippines and we managed to get to Manila and they gave me pants and a pay
                    advance. I stayed there and got some clothing. Then they directed me to go to
                    Guam. Dick Peterson was the consul general in Bien Hoa and had been the senior
                    State representative in Guam. He had just left and I became the senior State
                    person there. There were well over 100,000 refugees. An admiral in Guam was the
                    principal leader of the operations of handling evacuees. Each of the agencies
                    involved had to attend staff meetings. I spent a lot of time getting families
                    together. We had a lot of military. The Vietnamese military had left Vietnam
                    with Vietnamese aircraft. We encouraged that since it would take military
                    aircraft out of Vietnam. I spent a lot of time trying to get the military
                    personnel and their families back tougher. There were three or four camps. There
                    was the problem of a person being in one camp and his wife and children in
                    another. In fact I ran into Terry McNamara, he was the consul general in Can
                    Tho. David Sciacchitano was also in Can Tho. I spent a month there. I finally
                    had enough of it and I called the Department and said would you please get me
                    out of here. The next morning there was a cable stating that I was required back
                    in Washington on urgent business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there must have been people who'd been evacuated
                        that said hell I want to go back. I mean, you know, when you make a decision
                        like this, it's done in a hurry and I would expect that there must have been
                        some people who wanted to go back to Vietnam who had left family behind and
                        all. Were there any indications of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I don't recall anything like that. Certainly with all those numbers
                    that phenomenon developed later. I know people on the staff of the consulate
                    general who wanted to go back, but that came several years later, not
                    immediately. Overwhelmingly the people were very thankful to be out. No, I can't
                    say, in those days immediately after the evacuation that I ran into anybody who
                    wanted to return.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, we set up a camp in Pennsylvania, one in I think Florida and
                    another one in Arkansas. There were three camps and we shuttled them from Guam
                    into these camps. I didn't get involved in that operation. I just felt I wanted
                    to get away from it at that stage. So, when I went back to Washington they asked
                    me if I'd like to go to Hong Kong and be an Indo China analyst. They had
                    originally intended to send me and Charles Twining to Bangkok. Charlie Twining
                    just finished studying Cambodian and they were going to have him as the
                    Cambodian analyst and me as the Vietnamese analyst. The Thais at that point were
                    putting pressure on us and there was some cooling in our relationship. The Thais
                    wanted some kind of guarantee that if the Vietnamese continued to try to expand
                    that we would give them a commitment to come to their aid and that wasn't
                    forthcoming. There was some coolness in our relationship. In any event, our
                    ambassador in Thailand felt we should start to cut personnel and it was decided
                    to move my job to Hong Kong. So, I was assigned to consulate general Hong Kong.
                    I arrived in August of '75. Chuck Cross was the consul general. The place was
                    heavily staffed by China watchers. John Anderson was the chief political officer
                    and I worked for him. But I was the only person in the political section, which
                    must have had six or seven officers, who wasn't working on China.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we getting out of particularly South Vietnam, I
                        mean it had collapsed. We had expected a, what were we expecting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Politically it is hard for me to judge. We were concerned about the
                    impact on the rest of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The
                    Chinese at that time were still supporting the Vietnamese, as were the Soviets.
                    We were interested to see how; we were interested in developments in Cambodia as
                    well. The Khmer Rouge had taken over in Phnom Penn. I always said that the
                    Vietnamese were very fortunate in having the Cambodians next to them because
                    compared to the Cambodians they looked like nice people. There was a Vietnamese
                    presence in Hong Kong as well as a Cambodian presence. They had people there to
                    conduct trade and shipping into both Vietnam and Cambodia. There was a flow of
                    refugees from Vietnam. I don't recall any from Cambodia. I guess the Cambodians
                    were principally going to Thailand. So, I was interested in the refugee flows. I
                    had a lot of contact with the Hong Kong authorities on the question of refugees.
                    We were certainly supporting the policy of giving them first asylum and we took
                    the view that people with relatives in the United States or people brought into
                    Hong Kong on American vessels would be taken care of by us essentially. We felt
                    that whatever ship picked them up really should take care of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I was interested in debriefing refugees on conditions; I was interested in the
                    fate of our staff in Vietnam. We had a continued interest on the MIA (Missing in
                    Action) question and any sightings of Americans including any Americans who in
                    fact stayed behind. There were those that just elected to stay behind. As I
                    think I mentioned there was in Bien Hoa a young man who was working in a mental
                    hospital. I also recall a priest who stayed behind, an American priest and quite
                    a few others. So, we were interested in those kinds of thing. I followed the
                    Vietnamese efforts to sell goods and to import goods. We had an embargo on
                    American company trade with the Vietnamese. My presence was pretty well known in
                    Hong Kong. I was active in the American Chamber of Commerce there, which is a
                    large organization. They in fact formed a Vietnamese committee of people
                    interested in Vietnam. Some of them had been in business in Vietnam and had
                    left. Others were just looking for new opportunities. We managed to obtain
                    information on what ships were going to Vietnam and what cargo they were
                    bringing, so any time we noticed American goods we let it be known that that was
                    illegal. I recall one ship going into Cambodia and it was carrying a large
                    shipment of Kodak stuff. We had a customs representative in Hong Kong. The U.S.
                    Customs Officer went to Kodak and told them that we were distressed about this.
                    They assured us that they didn't know anything about it and they would look into
                    it. We had a similar thing with Monsanto's shipping chemicals. No great harm
                    would be done by Kodak selling film there, but when we did that the word got
                    around very quickly in the American community that we were watching this kind of
                    thing. I can remember one banker in particular saying, “Well, you know you're
                    not going to stop shipments of stuff into these countries.” I said, “Of course
                    not, but it's going to cost the Vietnamese and the Cambodian communist
                    governments an increase of 10% or 20% to buy through a middleman, then we've
                    already achieved our objective. This is not a wartime embargo; it's an economic
                    one.” So, I got involved in that kind of thing. I did debrief a lot of refugees.
                    I read the Vietnamese news agency broadcast every morning religiously. It was a
                    chore that I really used to dread, but it was very interesting what you could
                    draw from it. I also developed a range of business contacts who were going into
                    Vietnam and Hong Kong. I used to visit foreign diplomats from Hanoi who would
                    come down and do their R&amp;R in Hong Kong including Australians, Indians, and
                    Swedes. I can remember speaking to the Swedish aid people who were very
                    frustrated. There was an agreement between the Swedes and the Vietnamese that
                    any equipment that arrived became the property of the Vietnamese government.
                    They'd bring in equipment and the Vietnamese would want to tax it going in. Then
                    after that they'd take the equipment and say it's ours now and we'd rather put
                    it on this other project that the Soviets are helping us with and not have it on
                    your project. This used to just drive the Swedes wild. They had this huge paper
                    mill that they were developing in the north of Vietnam. So, this is the kind of
                    information I gathered in bits and pieces. It was interesting. I can't say that
                    there was any major breakthroughs or that I made any great major
                    discoveries.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I did notice that around '78 the Vietnamese had a party congress. All the people
                    associated with the Chinese were removed as well as people supporting the ethnic
                    minority programs. I didn't understand the link at first until I realized that
                    the ethnic minorities in the north of Vietnam, I kept on thinking in terms of
                    Montagnards, but the ethnic minorities in the north of Vietnam were largely out
                    of China. So, they must have looked at these things as being linked. In any
                    event, this was an early indicator that things were going sour between Vietnam
                    and China. There was a gradual buildup of Soviet relations with Soviet aircraft
                    going into the north and Soviet ships going into the Vietnamese ports. I think
                    that's what really triggered the downward slide. Chinese continued to leave
                    Vietnam including leaving through the north into China. The Chinese made some
                    quite a bit of noise about this, but I think their real concern was the
                    developing Vietnamese relationship with the Soviets and feeling circled by
                    enemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously we must have been looking for the possibility of
                        a conventional bloodbath after the revolution, after the North Vietnamese
                        had taken over South Vietnam. What were we getting from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. We had these terrible reports out of Cambodia. I had very little
                    information about what was going on in Cambodia, but it was obvious from what we
                    had that it was very grim. We were concerned that similar events would occur in
                    Vietnam. I was very pleased to see that it wasn't as bad as I thought it could
                    have been. The first reports I got were about the women who were associated with
                    American efforts, our former female staff. I heard that the women were given
                    very brief reeducation as they called it, usually a month or two, and then
                    released. I attributed this to a certain Asian chauvinist approach that women
                    couldn't have done anything of any real concern so you didn't have to bother
                    much with them. The male staff members had a much more difficult time. I did
                    learn from refugees who did get out that male staff members were in reeducation
                    for at least a year or more. Officers that I knew such as General Ba and General
                    Dao were both in reeducation camps. I recall one particular figure I believe the
                    governor of the central bank of Vietnam who had prevented President Thieu from
                    absconding with the gold. Thieu had, I understand, a Swiss aircraft in Saigon he
                    was going to take the gold on. I forgot how many millions of gold it was, but
                    this gentleman had barred the president's access to the gold. The communists
                    ended up getting the gold and after all that effort they threw this poor guy
                    into reeducation as well. So, I guess that didn't count for a lot.</p>
                <p>There were reports in Hong Kong that if you had money you could buy your way out.
                    There were boats that would take people out and drop them off near Thailand or
                    try to get them into Hong Kong. The British also set up flights between Hong
                    Kong and Saigon to take out people who were connected to Hong Kong. I was able
                    to talk to those kind of people. In general things were severe, difficult, but
                    we didn't have the kind of mass executions that occurred in Phnom Penn.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: In fact the communist government maintained the Republic of Vietnam
                    piaster for quite some time. I had left with a bag full of this money. I didn't
                    think anything of it. I thought it would be worthless the day we left. I had it
                    as a souvenir and I would have gladly have given it away to the Vietnamese staff
                    before I left if I had thought that it was worth anything. I was very sorry
                    about that. I think it took them about two years before they changed to their
                    new communist dong.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you consulting with the China watchers on Chinese
                        Vietnamese relationships? Was there much thought given to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Well, in fact this report I wrote on the deteriorating
                    relationship between China and Vietnam sparked quite a bit of interest. We had
                    started to normalize relations with China, we had a liaison office in Beijing at
                    this time. The staff sent me up to visit it. I saw Ambassador Woodcock then, but
                    things started going downhill. In '78 when I visited China, the people in our
                    embassy in Beijing thought that I might be able to get near the Vietnamese
                    border, which is what I would have liked to have done to be able to see for
                    myself any military buildup. They decided that when I got to southern China I
                    should apply for a permit to go from there to the border area and that I'd
                    probably be turned down in Beijing. Anyhow, they wouldn't allow me near the
                    border, but they did allow me to go to the refugee camp and I got an opportunity
                    to interview the Chinese who came out of Vietnam. It was an eye opener to me.
                    What the Chinese were complaining about, and I was certainly not one to be a
                    great defender of the Vietnamese communists, was they wanted some sort of
                    privileged minority status. They wanted a different kind of ID card. The
                    Vietnamese wanted everybody to register and if you were going to live in Vietnam
                    you should be a Vietnam citizen. That included being eligible to serve in the
                    military. Well, they didn't want to serve in the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They hadn't in the South Vietnamese system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: These are Northern Chinese. These people had fled from the north. They
                    didn't want to serve in the Vietnamese army and they didn't want to speak
                    Vietnamese and they wanted to have some sort of special status and have their
                    own schools and be left alone. They just wanted to live in Vietnam. I said to
                    myself, well, I can see why the Vietnamese regarded this as unwelcome. Of
                    course, I didn't say that to the Chinese. It didn't sound to me like they were
                    being abused and the Vietnamese took the attitude of well, if you want to go to
                    China, feel free to leave and they did. Of course the Chinese didn't feel they
                    needed any more people. So, this is a bone of contention between the two
                    countries. When I got back from this trip the Chinese had started moving forces
                    towards the border. I can recall that I estimated there were about 1,000
                    aircraft moved south in the vicinity of the Vietnamese border. I knew at that
                    point that this is not a bluff, this is not posturing. I filed what was to be my
                    only real dissent cable in my career. At that juncture the consul general didn't
                    see it my way. We didn't put it in the dissent channel, although it was
                    originally written that way. He decided to send it in as another view from the
                    consul general. The consensus of the China watchers was that the Chinese were
                    very reasonable people and they were just concerned about these refugees and
                    they were just trying to put some pressure on the Vietnamese. I said, no I
                    thought that they were really concerned about a Soviet buildup in Vietnam. They
                    really didn't care much about the refugees and they fully intended to attack. In
                    December of '78, a China watcher, Sarah Ann Smith, and I wrote a joint cable,
                    saying that the Chinese actions had vindicated our position. I felt satisfied
                    with that. By that time I started meeting with the Chinese officials or semi-
                    officials in Hong Kong. One particular gentleman was specializing on Vietnamese
                    affairs. So, I mean he knew who I was and I knew who he was. The day after the
                    Chinese attacked the border in February of '79 he invited me to lunch. I can
                    recall arriving at the lunch and he was sitting at the table already waiting for
                    me and he was beaming. So, I went in and sat down and he didn't know what to say
                    and he finally looked up to me and said, “Well, what do you think?” I paused and
                    I thought it over a while and I finally said to him, “I think it's pretty good
                    that you're just four years too late.” He laughed. I hoped that they reported
                    that as such. But, I can still recall from our conversation that we were in
                    discussions of normalizing relations with Vietnam ourselves. He expressed some
                    very strong views of his disapproval of such a move. He noted we were
                    normalizing relations with China and that pressing to be friendly with these
                    abusive Vietnamese probably would not be taken well in Beijing. I think that
                    attitude had a certain influence on our terminating the exercise. I don't say it
                    was that factor alone, but I certainly think it was relevant.</p>

                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. I was a sort of a one man band and my contacts were people who
                    really were interested or had business links with Vietnam when the Vietnamese
                    were approaching for credit or barter arrangements or that kind of thing. I also
                    followed the Laotians. I went over to Bangkok from time to time as well and met
                    with Charles Twining and we went up to refugee camps and talked to the
                    refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been concerned about all the military
                        equipment that ended up in the North Vietnamese hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. One of the disappointments was what happened to the military
                    equipment in Da Nang. We had this mass of fighter aircraft that were all set to
                    be flown off. The Vietnamese pilots instead of flying them off took their
                    families and got on the boats. When the communists arrived they found these
                    aircraft all set up and ready to go. We lost aircraft in Bien Hoa air base as
                    well. I did debrief former military ARV people who got out on the status of the
                    aircraft. The Vietnamese weren't able to maintain and they couldn't get spare
                    parts for much of the aircraft, so it was of limited use. I would think that
                    they have a 100 years supply of artillery however. The aircraft was a more
                    perishable kind of commodity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any indication that our equipment was being used
                        against the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. They used '70s aircraft certainly including against the
                    Cambodians when the invaded Cambodia setting up a new government. That was also
                    during the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you seeing the Vietnamese/Cambodian relationship
                        in this '75 to '79 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, originally, when Pol Pot first took over, there wasn't any
                    obvious break in relations. Things slowly went downhill along the Vietnamese
                    Cambodian border. Frictions, clashes developed and it just slowly deteriorated.
                    But historically they hated each other, so it wasn't a surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that in a way that you were
                        looking at Vietnam. I mean, here is a place that we had spent lots of lives,
                        lots of our money and all and this was a focal point of our foreign policy
                        for over ten years and all. Then all of a sudden it disappears.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, it certainly was erratic. In fact, Charlie Twining and I used to
                    say that we two replaced Graham Martin and his cast of thousands. Yes. It went
                    from one extreme to another. Of course, in our realignment, our new relationship
                    with China changed the whole picture and Vietnam became really of marginal
                    interest. I mentioned previously, we made quite a bit of effort with the
                    refugees on the questions of MIAs and also with travelers, people like the
                    Swedes. We were always looking for Americans. I had worked with joint casualty
                    resolution center people in Vietnam and they used to come to Hong Kong as well.
                    So, we were always being urged to see if we could find out anything about
                    Americans. I always thought that they would surface. I was very skeptical about
                    prisoners remaining from the war period, but I expected that deserters would
                    surface. There were reports of an anti-communist insurgency trying to reorganize
                    and I was concerned about Americans going back to support that kind of activity.
                    In fact there were Americans who wanted to go back to get their families out.
                    So, that was another question. I thought there would be a good chance that there
                    would be Americans arrested in the post-war period. We did get some reports from
                    people in the North of seeing Americans. I recall a Swede telling me about a
                    black farmer who apparently spoke English and he was out plowing the fields.
                    That he didn't look like he was a prisoner, he looked like had a farm and a
                    family there. The Swede tried to talk to him and he just ran away. I was very
                    skeptical that there would have been any prisoners because it would have just
                    caused a lot of embarrassment to the Vietnamese government and there was no
                    advantage in their keeping them once the war was over. So, I didn't take the
                    Rambo kinds of things very seriously, but I certainly did take seriously the
                    possibility that Americans were there under other conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as we both know that during a war they had developed
                        a considerable deserter colony in Saigon hidden away where GI's were selling
                        dope and you know, sort of living under cover with a girlfriend
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, when I was in Bien Hoa we had information on somebody whom we
                    believed was a MIA, who was listed as an MIA. I tried to make arrangements to
                    have him photographed just to show that he wasn't a prisoner somewhere, but he
                    was in fact on the loose. We never were successful in getting a picture of him.
                    We had people who described him. There were a lot of these kinds and reports of
                    these kinds of characters running around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of apparatus were you reporting to back in
                        Washington? Was there sort of a Vietnamese desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, Jim Rosenthal was our original desk officer and then he was
                    replaced by Steve Lyon, a director from Vietnam and Bob Miller was our deputy
                    assistant secretary over all of these kinds of divisions. So, they would get our
                    reporting and they would send me instructions on any particular thing that they
                    would like me to focus on.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else you should talk about during
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I can't say that there was any particular event after the invasion. I
                    was amazed by the press at that time, I'm talking about the invasion of the
                    Chinese into Vietnam. The press made a lot of noise about how it was really a
                    victory for Vietnam because of the high Chinese casualties. That kind of comment
                    was surprising. I couldn't believe Beijing being worried very much about
                    casualties. I thought that the invasion was pretty much a success in sending a
                    message to the Vietnamese that they were very vulnerable to China and better
                    behave. The Vietnamese were fearful of China, China being their traditional
                    colonial boss. They always had this historic fear that they would come back as
                    Ho Chi Minh did. You might like to know that Ho Chi Minh organized the Vietnam
                    communist party in Hong Kong and had the first party congress in Macao. He was
                    arrested by the British and then eventually released. But they had to sneak him
                    out of the colony because they were afraid the French would assassinate him to
                    prevent him from returning to Indo China. I met actually one lady who had met Ho
                    Chi Minh while he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were Vietnamese politics raging in Hong Kong. I mean
                        were these just people that the Vietnamese had got to Hong Kong just waiting
                        to get the hell out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Most of the refugees that made it to Hong Kong were ethnic Chinese and
                    they had no interest in Vietnam once they got out. Most of them were economic
                    refugees and they would largely like to go to the United States. We had some
                    problem and friction with the Hong Kong government because we weren't willing to
                    take everybody that came out. There wasn't any Vietnamese activism in Hong Kong
                    directed against Vietnam. That didn't develop at all or I would have heard about
                    that. I'm sure of that. It was interesting to see how the attitude in the Hong
                    Kong business community changed significantly after the Chinese government
                    became hostile to the Vietnamese. Then suddenly the businessmen and the American
                    Chamber of Commerce were pretty well decided that they weren't interested in
                    Vietnam and in fact weren't sure that they had ever been. It sort of, this whole
                    effort vanished overnight. That was amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflection of, I mean there had been
                        a major anti-American movement both in the United States and Europe and all
                        against our involvement in the war and cheers for Ho Chi Minh and all. Did
                        these activists try to head out for Vietnam for the new workers paradise and
                        all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I didn't see much of that kind of thing. It seemed to me, after the
                    war, especially on the American side, there was a great loss of interest on what
                    was happening there. I didn't notice any concerns about human rights in Vietnam
                    after we were out in contrast to all the noise that had been made before. I do
                    remember there was an Italian journalist at the Far East National Tribune,
                    Tiziano Terzani, I think he's the editor now. He may have just left. He who
                    wrote a book on the fall of Saigon. He also wrote for the Spiegel, which is
                    funny. I remember I had great pleasure in telling him first how I bought his
                    book in Taiwan. He got the point; he didn't get any royalties on my purchase. I
                    then enumerated all the mistakes he had made in the book. He had written
                    something of a sympathetic presentation of the communists. He went back to
                    Vietnam after the election, after the Vietnamese communists finally set up some
                    sort of election machinery. When he came back again he was very disillusioned. I
                    have to give him credit, he did criticize the new regime. I found that the
                    foreign journalists took a far more serious interest in what was going on than
                    the Americans. They were interesting to talk to and they would ask me far more
                    interesting questions. The Americans tended to call me up and ask me what was
                    new. That was the kind of question I would get while the reporters from the
                    Guardian had really very penetrating questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by '79 were you actually getting a little bit fed up
                        with Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes, but I was still quite interested in Southeast Asia. I was up for
                    reassignment. The deputy principal officer in Hong Kong, Burt Levin went to
                    Bangkok to become the DCM and I expressed an interest to him in being the
                    principal officer in Northeast Thailand. He supported that and I ended up
                    actually getting that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in Udorn from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I left Hong Kong in '79. So after a year at FSI I left for Thailand in
                    the summer of '80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: '80 to '82. Yes. To the summer of '82.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening in Udorn at this point? We had, or
                        maybe we had dismantled our air bases and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. The Thais cooled towards us. We were trying to go somewhere else.
                    We had no military units other than a defense attach� office and a military
                    assistance there.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>In the summer of '80 there was still reaction to the aftermath of our departure
                    of Vietnam. The Thais were very concerned about any Vietnamese threat. They are
                    traditionally concerned about the Vietnamese influence in Laos and Cambodia.
                    That was the main focus of our military that I spoke to. Nothing happened that
                    really got people too excited, but we were just keeping a careful eye on the
                    Vietnamese and on the Lao governments. We had a lot of refugee camps there as
                    well. These were indigenous tribes from Laos. We had many Lao camps. These
                    people just had to cross the Mekong which was really a very easy thing to do.
                    Then we had a Cambodian camp in the southern part of our district along the
                    Cambodian border in Surin. All these camps had political operators of some kind.
                    The anti-communist Cambodians were operating in the very corner of Thailand,
                    where Laos meets with Cambodia where the Khmer Rouge were operating. In one camp
                    there were people who were tending fields in Laos. They would come down to live
                    in the camps in Thailand, but they planted their crops in Laos and then come
                    back to the camp. So, you had this constant flow back and forth. There was
                    always some type of activity going on. We were processing refugee applications
                    from all these camps. I was concerned about the welfare of the refugees and how
                    they were being treated. I got them some support from our refugee processing
                    people. We did provide support from our embassy. They would send vehicles over
                    to us for maintenance and that sort of stuff. I was very much interested in the
                    activities of the Thai communist party. The Thai communist party was really
                    dying. My personal feeling is that thanks to our efforts in Vietnam, the Thai
                    communist party never got off the ground. I think it had been more successful
                    earlier. We didn't have any serious insurgencies. There were some minor
                    incidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at your level a coolness of Thai officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Oh, not at all. They were very, very cordial. I had great access. I
                    met every governor in the northeast. I met all the generals and many of the
                    senior staff members. We spent a lot of time together discussing conditions in
                    Thailand including security concerns. We had the aid projects in the north.
                    Ambassador Abramowitz was there first as my chief of mission and then he was
                    replaced by John Gunther Dean who came up and visited some of the aid projects.
                    There was a lot of activity. I suppose the most exciting event when I was there;
                    there was an offensive coup. Ambassador Abramowitz was still there. I went down
                    to Korat to meet the general who was in charge of the forces. After my meeting
                    with the general I went out to dinner and drinks with his chief of intelligence.
                    I can remember we must have stayed out until 1:00 in the morning just talking
                    and drinking. My last question to the colonel before I left for my hotel was
                    there had been rumors about dissatisfaction among the young Turk colonels. Did
                    he think that there was the threat of a coup? He didn't, he said no he hadn't
                    heard anything. So, I went back to the hotel. The next morning the coup
                    occurred. I'm sure that the Thais thought that I had some inside information. I
                    never even tried to argue with them. You know, they just took it for granted
                    that the Americans know everything. That's their basic approach to life. That
                    was a very interesting time. The colonels grabbed Bangkok and they thought they
                    had everything under control. There were certain rules of the game for a coup.
                    It's sort of seize everything and people take sides and then you count tanks and
                    whoever has the most things wins. What happened in this case was the king was in
                    Bangkok and got into his car. The king liked to drive. The king was really a
                    sacred entity and he got in his car and he drove out of the city. There were no
                    Thais anywhere who would dare go up against the king. He just simply drove to
                    Korat where I was and no one was willing to stop him. I understand that General
                    Prin, who was the Prime Minister at that time, had been arrested by one of the
                    colonels. I wasn't there, but I was told later that when he was put under
                    arrest, the queen called and a colonel explained to the queen that General Prin
                    had been arrested and was being held at gunpoint by another colonel. The queen
                    asked to speak to the colonel and the poor colonel got on the phone with the
                    queen and she was giving him the what for. While she was berating the poor
                    colonel, Prin walked out the door. The colonel didn't know what to do because he
                    couldn't hang up on the queen. Meanwhile, the king got in his car and he drove.
                    I had been talking to my friend, the chief of Thai intelligence, the previous
                    evening and he was conveying to me all their plans and developments. When I was
                    calling this information down to the embassy the phone line went dead. I was
                    speaking to Jim Wilson who was the political counselor. Jim and I had served
                    together in Munich. I was conveying to him all the developments in German. Of
                    course, if the colonels had our phones tapped, they could eventually know what
                    we were saying, but this was very perishable kind of stuff. It may take them a
                    while to dig up a Thai who could speak German. The next day the king and the
                    Prime Minister who were in Korat squashed the whole thing. I think only one poor
                    fellow was killed and this was by accident when somebody fired a gun at a
                    roadblock to get their car to stop. That was the only casualty of the whole
                    coup. That was a very exciting time. I was in a very serious situation where I
                    was the only contact with the Thai government up in Korat because they had all
                    moved up to Korat. The embassy was relaying messages offering to assist and of
                    course we wanted a peaceful resolution. We wanted to restore the elected
                    government. One surprising element in this period was that the queen came out on
                    the radio attacking the coup and that was regarded by the Thais as not very
                    proper. That caused a little bit of pain.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador in Thailand at the time and how did
                        he use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: When I arrived it was Morton Abramowitz. He was really focused on
                    refugees. He really became Mr. Refugee. His wife was a super activist among the
                    refugees that she dealt with in the camps. His staff was very refugee oriented.
                    So, we were expected to give support to the refugees and to monitor positions of
                    refugee camps. I did a lot of internal and domestic reporting. I would say I
                    reported on a large percentage on the members of parliament. I wrote some stuff
                    on who was going to win elections, covered bread and butter issues and tried to
                    recruit candidates for USIS grants for the United States and that kind of thing.
                    So, I did some domestic reporting. It all went pretty well I think. I talked to
                    members of the political parties on all sides. General [inaudible] also had come
                    up to my area and he became elected as the member of parliament from a province
                    in the northeast. So, we had him as a presence and many of the political
                    figures. I think the present prime minister was also a candidate in my area at
                    one point. So, I got to meet a lot of the folks there. The “political figures.”
                    After John Gunther Dean came there was less focus on refugees more on the aid
                    side and our political relations. I think they were probably a bit more
                    interested in my political reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you sense a concern to keep Thailand in the whatever
                        you want to call it, the democratic camp or at least out of the communist
                        camps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. As I mentioned before we did have a military aid program. The
                    ties were very cordial. I think the one thing they weren't going to agree to
                    would be the presence of the U.S. military because they thought that invited
                    them as a target. But aside from that I think they wanted to have good relations
                    with us politically and certainly encourage American tourists. American trade
                    was of great interest. I had nothing but cooperation from the officials on the
                    political on the military side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned tourists. Around this time I guess it
                        continued before that, too, Bangkok was sort of the sex capital of
                        everywhere, I mean, the Japanese, the Germans had special sex life
                        practically going in there. Did sex rear its ugly head or did your staff
                        have any problems like that or were you sort of out of the line of
                        fire?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Northeast Thailand makes a great contribution to this trade, they
                    provide most of the women. We'd get a minimum number of tourists. There were
                    some archeological diggings that people were interested in and we had the Surin
                    elephants show, but aside from that there wasn't any major tourist attraction in
                    the northeast. I didn't have problems on that side. We did have a modest number
                    of retired American military living with their Thai wives. Many of them had
                    alcohol and other problems. I managed to meet them all and straighten out some
                    of their problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Thailand beginning to become an economic tiger at this
                        point? What was your impression of the Thais as opposed to the Vietnamese as
                        far as economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I think the real economic surge in Thailand was right after I
                    left. It was beginning, but I can't say that it was really in full bloom yet and
                    in the northeast they have a great deal of poverty. This area is almost totally
                    dependent upon agriculture. We were concerned to some degree about the growing
                    of things like marijuana, and we did have the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) come
                    from time to time. We were concerned about smuggling drugs across into Laos. We
                    were really small potatoes. I was most concerned about furthering the
                    development of the area than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in 1982 whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it was time for me to move again. I can remember I was on the
                    road and I got a message from my communicator saying that you've been asked if
                    you want to be DCM in “I think Switzerland.” After some back and forth, it ended
                    up being Swaziland. I was asked to be the DCM in Swaziland. I was originally
                    offered a job to be the political military officer in Panama, but that fell
                    through. That's a story all by itself. So, I ended up taking this job in
                    Swaziland. There was a political appointee Robert Phinny was appointed as
                    ambassador. He was a Republican businessman from Michigan and they wanted
                    somebody experienced to go with him to Mbabane which is the capital. I accepted
                    the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in Swaziland from '83 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: To '85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way having dealt with Southeast Asia and all this
                        would have been a little bit of a relaxation, rest or come down or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: It was going from one kingdom to another for starters, that was the
                    similarity. In addition we had the African National Congress operating against
                    the South Africans. We also had Mozambique next door. Swaziland borders
                    Mozambique and South Africa. There were some stories; in fact our embassy staff
                    expedited my getting there. Our embassy staff in Maputo had fled into Swaziland.
                    Swaziland was an interesting place. It was a very prosperous island in the
                    middle of Southern Africa. The Swazis fancy themselves as the Switzerland of
                    Southern Africa. That's a bit of a stretch, but it is a lovely place. The
                    capital of Mbabane is about 4,000 feet up. The country became independent in
                    1968 and its king was a gentleman by the name of Sobhuza, II. He had died just
                    before I arrived, just a few weeks before I arrived. He had about 90 wives and
                    he had over 100 children. He was really something of a semi-God to the people.
                    He was a very cautious, wise, well-balanced man from what I could see and heard.
                    He ruled after Swazi gained independence and they didn't go into promoting
                    radical change. There were many British; it was originally a British
                    protectorate. Many South Africans invested in the place and they had a fairly
                    substantial tourist trade. It was very active and had some of the most modern
                    sugar plantations in the world. They had the largest man made forest in the
                    world until the Brazilians built a forest larger than Swaziland. The Swazis
                    couldn't catch up. This is a country of a half a million people, a little bigger
                    than Kuwait, but smaller than Massachusetts. I arrived when they were in
                    mourning. I found the place very interesting. We had a FBIS (Foreign Broadcast
                    Information Service) station there that was monitoring all the open broadcasts
                    out of South Africa, Mozambique and Africa in general. I got some good political
                    coverage from those events. It was an interesting window to see how things were
                    developing both in South Africa and in Mozambique. I didn't do a lot of
                    reporting on it, but found it quite interesting. The Swazis had a very
                    traditional government. They had only this one leader and most of the population
                    was very content under their system. They had a parliament during the British
                    days. Then they were granted independence. They had a constitution and the king
                    had suspended of parts of the constitution except the part dealing with the
                    judiciary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a new king?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No, the old king. So, when I arrived they were in this state; the
                    political parties had been banned. The Swazi view of things was that they were a
                    small community and they didn't want to have one side against the other. Their
                    idea of settling problems was getting everybody involved in a room and talk it
                    to death and then come up with some sort of consensus. They thought that was a
                    much healthier way of resolving problems than slugging it out and voting on it.
                    I must admit I had great reservations writing the human rights report. There is
                    a certain vocal arrogance in writing a human rights report. It just struck me
                    that their society was relatively happy, punching away. But because they didn't
                    run their government and conduct government the way we do, they were inferior,
                    undemocratic. Their system of government is that the king and his mother ruled
                    at the same time. When the mother dies, as Sobhuza's mother had already died,
                    the king and his senior wife, the senior wife replaces the mother as
                    co-sovereign. When the king dies which is what happened when I was there, the
                    senior wife became the regent. Then royal family, the immediate family and the
                    royal members meet and they discuss and discuss and discuss and they form a
                    consensus of who should be the next king. There is no automatic selection of the
                    king. So, they were in the process of trying to decide who of Sobhuza's children
                    should be king. Their preference was to have an infant be the king and to raise
                    an infant as king from the beginning from infancy. Sobhuza didn't have any
                    infants, he was in his 80's, but he had some quite young children. They finally
                    selected a young man. They first made him the crown prince and he eventually
                    became king, Mswati III. In the meantime when he was selected his mother,
                    Ntombi, became the regent in place of Sobhuza's senior wife. The whole apparatus
                    is surrounded by counselors and the system is that the king makes a lot of the
                    executive decisions with his prime minister, but there's always the traditional
                    channels of appeal through his mother and through the wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can just see you're trying to puzzle this out and put it
                        into a sort of check list off of a human rights or something, you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. Actually I got very much involved in this. The Swazis, the royal
                    family is very secretive about how they go about business and the average Swazi
                    doesn't really know how decisions are made. I'm talking about decisions
                    impacting on the royal family, but the government is a different matter. The
                    government was a blend of tradition and parliamentary government. There were
                    white Swazis, Englishmen, who were members of the parliament and the government
                    had white ministers. One of the speakers was a white Brit originally and they
                    have made a great effort and have continued to make a great effort in balancing
                    both sides. This is a country that is 95% black, 95% Swazi, but they welcomed
                    white participation in the economy and in the government. Outside of South
                    Africa they have one of the highest standards of living in Africa as well as
                    having good health conditions. They had abundant food. Anything you wanted you
                    can buy there. Their money was interchangeable with the South African Rand, and
                    they had a proper relationship, correct relationship with South Africa. While I
                    was there the South Africans set up a trade office and the head of the trade
                    office was a Foreign Service Officer from the South African Foreign Ministry, so
                    he was obviously in the sense their ambassador. It was a very interesting
                    period. I could talk a long time about just the structure of the society and how
                    it functioned. They have two different sets of laws. They have polygamy, which
                    is permitted, and a woman can be married under the traditional system or could
                    be married with a modern judge or priest or whatever. Some members of this
                    parliament and the government had one wife and some had several. We had dinner
                    with all these folks and had some of them over. Some of them always came with
                    the same wife. I can remember one colonel who became head of the army. Every
                    time he came to dinner at my house he had a different wife, so I just got used
                    to it. I thought it was interesting, sort of starting all over to meet another
                    one. But, you had this very interesting mixture of how I approached them. We had
                    a large aid presence. We sent quite a few Swazis to be educated in the United
                    States. In fact the present Prime Minister of Swaziland, Barnabas, was educated
                    in the United States. He's an accountant and he was a minister, finance minister
                    when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work I mean sometimes the United States can
                        spoil somebody, you know, coming back full of American piss and vinegar and
                        wanting to change things around. How did, not just him, but other American
                        educated people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I don't think it was a problem. Swazis are very conservative people. I
                    used to say they were lovers, not fighters. The fire-eaters would be more likely
                    to come from the South African University people who were influenced by the ANC.
                    There was an ANC presence, which they went along with. What the Swazis didn't
                    permit were any anti-South African activities. Activities on either side. They
                    felt that they were a neutral area and they were in favor of a democratic rule
                    in South Africa and they didn't want any operations against South Africa to be
                    conducted from Swaziland. While I was there the South African government in fact
                    attempted to cede to Swaziland the area between Swaziland and the ocean on the
                    East Coast. The area south of Mozambique. The South African government had felt
                    it needed to cede the property and the Swazis had accepted it and the Zulu tribe
                    sued in court. The court found that the South African government hadn't followed
                    the proper procedures and the Zulus claimed this territory was legitimately part
                    of the Zulu area. As a result the land transfer didn't take place, but it was an
                    interesting example of how business was done there and how their relationship
                    was. They got along and when the senior Swazis became ill they were all
                    evacuated to the hospitals in South Africa. It was just an interesting
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had a political ambassador, his name was
                        Phinny?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Phinny, Robert Phinny.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he from, what was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: He was a businessman and he was from Michigan. I think he fell within
                    the lines of the Gerald Ford group. He was a contributor. He was very interested
                    in Africa and he was an older gentleman and he related well with the
                    personalities in government. His wife was an absolute angel who got along very
                    well with the people there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, was the government of
                        Mozambique fishing or trying to create troubled waters in Swaziland or were
                        there any problems from that side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Mozambique had some sort of war going on and we were interested in it
                    as well. They were much too tied up with their own internal problems to be
                    worried about us. While I was there I was able to drive into Maputo. We had a
                    charg� there who I stayed with in a beach house for a weekend. When you went to
                    Mozambique you had to bring all your food with you because you couldn't buy
                    anything. I can remember when I drove in I'd hit a pothole and the car bounced
                    so much that the battery cracked. The embassy had a motor boat and I had to
                    borrow their battery and try to get my car home. Then I sent them a new
                    battery.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>During my last year there I was the charg�. Bob Phinny left and the
                    anti-government forces in Mozambique cut the roads into Swaziland and so we
                    weren't able to go in there anymore. We did have some problems with refugees
                    coming out of there. So, I was back in the refugee business and I had a lot of
                    meetings with the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)
                    representative. There were refugees from South Africa as well in Swaziland, but
                    we got an influx of refugees from Mozambique at that time as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '85, did Swaziland find any part in what was
                        it, the policy at that time called constructive engagement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Constructive engagement. Chet Crocker was our assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we sort of looking at this through your Swazi
                        contacts, were they telling you how this thing was going or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, the Swazi government is very sympathetic to our approach. They
                    themselves were trying to do the best they could to get along and to work with
                    the South Africans. I think they would foster any meetings between the South
                    Africans and ourselves and the rest of the African states. So, I viewed
                    Swaziland as an opportunity to demonstrate what free market economy and
                    investment could do in Southern Africa. I was hopeful that we could encourage
                    more investments there. My own feeling was that if the economy grew the majority
                    of the people would be drawn more and more into the economy and would take on
                    more management roles. I thought this was a very constructive way to go through
                    change. I'm not convinced that we were wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '85 whither then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: At that stage from the summer of '84 to '85 I was the charg� there, I
                    was assigned to the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, ICAF here in
                    Washington, DC for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it was very interesting. One of our speakers who came there,
                    spoke both at ICAF and at the National War College, both are part of the
                    National Defense University. We had a great variety of speakers. They would
                    speak to the joint student body. It was very interesting. Secretary Kissinger
                    came and Secretary Schultz. There were always members of the joint chiefs of
                    staff and there was a great cross section from the government into class. Of
                    course I'd been in the navy before so I was accustomed to being with military
                    personnel. There were people from NSA (National Security Agency) and CIA and a
                    lot of DOD present there and other organizations. It was a very good opportunity
                    to exchange experiences and views. While I was there I had participated in the
                    shipbuilding seminar and we went out to Korea and Japan to study their
                    construction of ships. I'd never been to Korea before and I got out to the DMZ
                    (demilitarized zone). I also did a seminar that sent us to Singapore and
                    Malaysia. There was a nice variety of personalities and different groups and
                    from different agencies. Very interesting experience. I enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well in '86 what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, at that point I thought it was time to go to the Department. As
                    you might have noticed I didn't spend much time in the Department. In fact while
                    I was at the ICAF I got a phone call from personnel and they asked me if I
                    wanted to be the consul general in Salzburg. I said how much time do I have to
                    give you an answer and they said we're going to decide in two hours, call me
                    back. I remember calling my wife and saying, “would you like to go to Salzburg?”
                    She said, “Who's the last person you've heard of being promoted out of
                    Salzburg?” You know, it would be the end and it wouldn't be a very good place to
                    look for a job unless you're a musician. So, she managed to persuade me that
                    that as wonderful as the place might be, it wasn't really a good career move.
                    Almost with tears in my eyes I called back and said, no thank you. I could not
                    imagine when I was a student in Georgetown that I would someday turn down the
                    consul general in Salzburg, but I'm doing it. Mort Abramowitz was the director
                    of INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research) and I ended up on the INR staff as
                    an intelligence liaison office. My responsibility there was following special
                    operations in Africa where I'd just come from and Asia and Europe. Those three
                    areas and I eventually inherited the Middle East because the fellow who was
                    doing it had left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were doing this from when about '86 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Let's see. '86 to '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What at that time was meant by special operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, actually the correct term was covert operations. The system is
                    such that if the president wants to approve a covert operation then you have to
                    sign something called a finding, which would approve something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice you didn't get Latin American in your
                        choice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: No, no, a gentleman by the name of Jon Wiant who is still in the
                    Foreign Service took care of Latin America. I had no former experience in Latin
                    America and I was happy to stay away from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thinks about the efforts to open up to get our
                        hostages out of Beirut and the efforts of Ollie North and others to give
                        missiles to the Iranians and all this. Did that fall in your bailiwick at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Nothing that he did ever came to our attention. He never told us any
                    of these actions or plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize I'm treading on sensitive ground at this point.
                        So, I'm going to just ask, is there anything we can discuss?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, this was a very interesting period for me because in addition to
                    getting reporting on the areas I was responsible for I had other policy
                    opportunities. We had weekly meetings with the assistant secretary or usually
                    his principal deputy assistant secretary and their counterpart in the CIA. They
                    would come over and discuss matters of mutual interest of any nature. I was
                    supposed to attend these meetings as a representative of Mort Abramowitz. So, I
                    got an opportunity to meet Chas Freeman who was the principal deputy assistant
                    secretary in AF and Chet Crocker who was his boss. Then in NEA Ambassador Murphy
                    and Ed Djerejian who was his principal deputy who I might add was also a
                    graduate of Georgetown. I remembered him as a student there. In EUR, Roz
                    Ridgeway was the assistant secretary. I can't remember who was the DAS. Because
                    of matters of internal difficulties things didn't work out as well in East Asia.
                    I got involved in a lot of meetings at the director level, but the assistant
                    secretary, Gaston Sigur, never seemed to be available for any of these meetings
                    with us. So, that didn't work out so well. But, it was an interesting time and
                    it showed me there was a resolution mechanism if there was disagreement with the
                    agency. We would raise these issues in this meeting and then I would also
                    prepare agendas for meetings with Ambassador Abramowitz and sometimes the
                    Secretary for meetings with the agencies as well. So, I mention all this because
                    it was a way that the Department exchanges views and communicates with the
                    agency on these policy matters. I found it very interesting. Yes, you got
                    everything from placating the ambassador when the chief of station fell asleep
                    during the staff meetings to very serious disagreements on whether we should
                    undertake certain operations in a country or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, maybe we were beginning of the end of the period
                        where William Casey was the Director of the CIA, who usually with others who
                        might say of his ilk were advocating a very full policy of doing activist
                        covert activities. Casey was an ex-OSS operator. That spirit seemed to
                        prevail which caused a hell a lot of trouble for the Reagan administration.
                        Were you noticing that, was this something that the State Department was
                        concerned about, we were getting, doing a little too much covertly that
                        maybe could be done overtly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Not in the programs I was involved with. I don't think that people
                    felt that they were being overdone. I think they were very conservative and I
                    think they were very cautious. I wouldn't say this was a very activist time. I
                    think we were still recovering from involvement in Vietnam and I think things
                    were pretty quiet. Casey died while I was there, early on while I was there.
                    Actually the programs that were proposed were fairly modest and our major focus,
                    let me say, was in Angola and Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are essentially quite well known.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Yes. So, depending on how you view those activities, but I wouldn't
                    say that they were any kind of Terry and the Pirates kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in NEA whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, I ended up coming over to the career transition office and I
                    worked on the staff as a career counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did that for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '88 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: To '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To '90.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: I retired in December of '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the career transition
                        office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, when we started this conversation I said I enjoyed every job I
                    had and I enjoyed that one as well. I thought that the staff was superb there.
                    The people are very dedicated in trying to help people find new things to do,
                    find new careers if they wanted it. It gave me an opportunity to meet a great
                    cross section of people who had been in the State Department and USIS. I enjoyed
                    trying to find jobs for them. I used to edit the job openings list that was
                    published. It was a very interesting worthwhile experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there was a good fit of people who left the
                        Foreign Service? I'm talking about the broad Foreign Service and the
                        civilian world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>LAHIGUERA: Well, it was hard making an adjustment after somebody had been in the
                    government that long to adjust into the civilian world if I can put it that way.
                    People who were very senior or well-known people like Mort Abramowitz and Roz
                    Ridgeway didn't need help from us. They got plenty of offers on their own.
                    People who had administrative and management experience were pretty attractive.
                    Then after that it was just dependent upon the nature and the character of the
                    person involved and what they wanted to do. We gave Foreign Service Officers
                    three months of transition period and it gave them a chance to organize and to
                    think of what they wanted to do next; to develop their resume and get some
                    practice on how they would present themselves and to start looking around. It
                    wasn't so traumatic as just retiring them. I think it was very constructive. I
                    saw some people find some very interesting jobs. Most people had ended up making
                    their own opportunities. That's what one does in life. I think it was a very
                    healthy program. Even people who didn't find jobs right away were given a chance
                    to adjust to the idea of retiring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, thank you very much.</hi>
