                <p>AMBASSADOR WILLIAM C. HARROP</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 24, 1993</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 24, 1993. This is an interview with
                        William C. Harrop on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies. I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. To begin with, could I get a little bit about when
                        and where were you born and a bit about your family and your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Surely. I was born in Baltimore [MD] on February 19, 1929. My father was
                    a doctor, specializing mostly in research on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins
                    School of Medicine. He moved to E. R. Squibb &amp; Sons in New Brunswick, NJ,
                    when I was 10 years old. I went to Harvard and received an A.B.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What field was that in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: In English literature. Subsequently, after a stint in the Marine Corps
                    during the Korean War, I used the GI Bill to spend a year in graduate work in
                    journalism at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Just as I was
                    completing that — in fact I was within a very short time of obtaining a master's
                    degree in journalism — I was offered an appointment in the Foreign Service and
                    accepted it. I was one of a considerable group of people who were delayed in
                    entering the Foreign Service for a couple of years by Senator Joseph McCarthy.
                    This was the group who came in around 1954. We had been held up for two years
                    when McCarthy cut off the funding to hire new Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you toward the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HARROP: You know, that's an interesting question, because I wasn't sure of what I
                    wanted to do. I think that there is a common tendency to have a mix of interest
                    in journalism and diplomacy. This was true in my case. When I left college — I
                    graduated from Harvard in 1950 — the father of a young woman whom I knew was the
                    editor of the “Saturday Evening Post.” He had worked on newspapers all over the
                    country and gave me letters of introduction to about a dozen editors of
                    newspapers in New England: the “Providence Journal,” the “Boston Globe,” the
                    “Hartford Courant,” the “Greenfield Times,” Springfield newspapers, the “New
                    York Times.” I traveled around, interviewing these people, looking for a job on
                    the editorial side, with no luck at all. It was a very bad time to be looking
                    for work on a newspaper.</p>
                <p>As I was making those visits, I stopped off at Deerfield Academy, in Deerfield,
                    MA, where I had gone to school. Frank Boydon, the great old headmaster who was
                    there at the time, persuaded me, since I was not doing well finding a job in
                    journalism, to come there and teach for a time. So I spent about five months
                    teaching there before going into the Marines.</p>
                <p>When I left the Marines, the idea of journalism still attracted me, and I went to
                    the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri. While there, I read a
                    book or two about the Foreign Service. I was impressed by repeated stories about
                    how difficult the Foreign Service exam was. I had a kind of, “Oh, yeah?”
                    response to that. When I got out of the service in 1952, I took a “cram” course
                    at George Washington University for 10 or 11 weeks during the summer and then
                    took and passed the Foreign Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the three and a half day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, three and a half days. Then the die was cast, without any particular
                    planning or any particular preparation. I had taken no economics courses in
                    college, and economics is extremely important in the Foreign Service. In fact, I
                    didn't take much political science — mostly English literature. In that sense I
                    entered the Foreign Service almost by chance and had a fascinating, 39-year
                    career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came into the Foreign Service in 1954, just when
                        the McCarthy period was coming to an end. A new trickle of people came into
                        the Foreign Service. Did you have regular classes or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HARROP: It was interesting. The Department cleverly used a contrivance to bring
                    in a new group of officers. A really fine group of officers came in with me. The
                    Refugee Relief Act was passed in 1953, sponsored by Congressman Emmanuel Celler,
                    then the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The ostensible purpose of
                    the legislation was to provide visas for people uprooted from their homes during
                    World War II. The actual purpose was to provide a great many immigrant visa
                    numbers for what was called Fourth Category or Fourth Priority applicants. This
                    would mean, essentially, brothers, sisters, and parents of existing American
                    citizens or permanent resident immigrants.</p>
                <p>The Department used the money that was appropriated to implement this bill, which
                    was of interest to a lot of congressmen, because of their own constituents'
                    interests, to employ a group of perhaps 40 new FSO's [Foreign Service Officers]
                    who had been waiting on the register since no money had been appropriated for
                    their appointment. Some of these [newly-employed officers] went to Spain, some
                    to Greece, and Eastern Europe, and the majority of them to Italy. The two posts
                    [in Italy] receiving most of these officers were Naples and Palermo. For
                    instance, in Palermo I was with Samuel Gammon, H. Freeman Matthews, and a number
                    of other people who went on to have distinguished careers in the Foreign
                    Service. Nicholas Veliotes and Samuel Lewis were assigned to Naples. We all knew
                    one another at that time and have been good friends ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then there was very little training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We did not attend the standard A-100 Course [at the Foreign Service
                    Institute]. There was no orientation course for this whole group. Accepting the
                    appointment was a difficult decision for me. I had heard nothing from the
                    Department for months, and was suddenly told over the phone that if I would
                    appear within nine days in Washington I would receive an appointment and would
                    go to Palermo. I was within about two weeks of examinations in graduate school
                    [at the University of Missouri]. I decided to do it. My wife and I were
                    expecting a baby at the time. We packed up and flew back to the East Coast. I
                    left my wife with her parents in the Finger Lakes area of New York and went down
                    to Washington. The baby was born, by good luck, the day before I was to leave
                    for Italy. I spent a matter of hours in Washington, checking in, and left for
                    Palermo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an historical note, the first, organized class [at
                        the FSI] in the post-McCarthy period was in July, 1955, I think. That was
                        class A-1, or whatever. I was in it, and that's why I know. Before that you
                        were sent out as sort of infantry replacements.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HARROP: We really were sent out without any briefing or preparation at all and
                    had to make our way overseas. And making our way wasn't easy because the
                    Consulate General in Palermo in 1953 was a post which normally would have had
                    about 12 people, which seems large. Then, with the Refugee Relief Act, it just
                    exploded to almost 100. There were 75 or 80 people assigned, including about
                    eight or nine vice consuls. I remember that Samuel Gammon's in-laws, whose
                    [family] name was Renwick, and my in-laws, whose name was Delavan, happened to
                    take the same boat to visit us in Palermo. One couple said to the other, “Where
                    are you going?” The others said, “Well, we're going to visit our son-in-law
                    who's the American Vice Consul in Palermo.” The first pair took great umbrage at
                    that, replying, “No, our son-in-law is the American Vice-Consul in Palermo.” So
                    there was a large group of us, issuing visas almost entirely to mothers,
                    sisters, and parents of American citizens or holders of green cards [permanent
                    residents of the U. S.].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Palermo, as you observed the
                        scene at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was just after the era of Salvatore Giuliano. Giuliano was the great,
                    supposedly “Robin Hood” outlaw who came from a nearby town named Partinico. He
                    became a living legend after WWII, idolized and feared. Sicily was a very poor
                    island, indeed, at that time — it still is relatively poor, although “relative”
                    is an important word. One thing I recall is that on visiting the marketplace a
                    few days after arriving we experienced “culture shock.” When we saw great chunks
                    of meat hanging in the open air and covered by flies. Interestingly enough, in
                    later years, when we went to truly under-developed areas of Africa, we never
                    again experienced such a sense of culture shock. We'd been through that in
                    Southern Italy in the 1950s. Sicily is a beautiful island. The wonderful Greek
                    ruins are really some of the finest in the world. I think that it was a blessing
                    to this very compatible group of young Foreign Service Officers, all coming in
                    together, all with young children. Some of our best friends still are the people
                    who were with us in Palermo.</p>
                <p>The Mafia, at that time, was a very active organization. Its role in World War II
                    in connection with the landings in Sicily has been well recorded, but the every
                    day presence of the Mafia was something which we hadn't quite expected. I don't
                    mean that in the sense that one felt a concern for physical security, as you
                    would in Central Park in New York or in parts of Washington, D.C., today, but
                    nonviolent crime was common. For instance, one officer's home was robbed. All
                    the goods in it were stolen, including the furniture, while he and his family
                    were away. The police and security forces, who were interested in having good
                    relations with the United States, wanted to resolve the case quickly. So they
                    arrested the local Mafia leader, whose identity was no secret. Within about 18
                    hours the real criminals came forward and all of the booty was recovered. I
                    don't think that the Mafia had had anything to do with the theft at all, but the
                    power of the organization was such that the police could use them to find the
                    real thieves.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Refugee Relief Program, which I was involved in about
                        a year later up in Frankfurt [Federal Republic of Germany], included a
                        rather extensive, investigatory branch. We had people going out and
                        investigating backgrounds and all that. How did this work out in Palermo as
                        far as our handling of the security aspect of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: That was a major part of the operation: the extreme sensitivity toward
                    communism. A sizeable organization called the IRP, or Investigations, Refugee
                    Program, was formed. In fact, that was the beginning of the role of Scott
                    McLeod, who later became — I would have to use the word, “notorious,” as a
                    security officer in the State Department. He ran that operation which included
                    some 50 people in Palermo alone, performing investigations in some depth of
                    every applicant for a visa, trying to find some linkage to the Communist Party,
                    which was, of course, a major party in Italy at the time and had a strong
                    following among the poor Sicilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Mafia? Did that play a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Not really. I don't recall that the Mafia question was an important issue
                    in regard to the visa applications, although a criminal record was
                    disqualifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, technically, the Refugee Relief Program was supposed
                        to be for people who had been pushed out of their homes because of World War
                        II and so forth. From my perspective we were dealing with people who
                        basically fled from Eastern Europe. This was when I was in Frankfurt. They
                        came from all over the place. But in Italy you were talking about people who
                        had been displaced by the U.S. Army for a very short period. These weren't
                        refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, they weren't. When I mentioned that the largest part of the program
                    was located in Southern Europe, I was thinking of the fact that most of the
                    visas granted under it were issued in Italy, Greece, Spain, and Yugoslavia — the
                    sources of American immigrants over the past couple of generations.</p>
                <p>There were also offices under this program — and you were subsequently in one of
                    them in Frankfurt — in Central and Eastern Europe. However, I would estimate
                    that no more than 10% of the visas issued under the program throughout Europe
                    involved people who actually were refugees. The great bulk came from Italy, and
                    were relatives of those already in America.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree. We used to watch with wonder these decisions
                        which would turn Italians, who were living in their own homes, into
                        refugees, particularly when the applicants whom we were dealing with [in
                        Germany] were truly refugees. Again, I'm drawing on my own experience.
                        However, did this program, at an early stage, develop cynicism about
                        political “bills” and all of that? Knowing what you were doing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, I don't know. To some extent that was the case. We had one
                    interesting experience when Congressman Celler visited Palermo to review the
                    program on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came, by the way, from a heavily Italian district in
                        New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: A heavily Italian district in New York. I remember when he came through
                    [Palermo]. I was a rather outspoken young man at the time, in fact a callous
                    young man and I said, “You know, Mr. Celler, I'm concerned that very few of the
                    people that we're granting visas under your Act are really refugees. I'm also
                    concerned that we may not be attracting to America the highest quality of
                    Italians that we could bring. Most of the applicants are not among the better
                    educated or more ambitious or more promising.” He was absolutely furious at
                    that. He said, “You should know that Italian-Americans are among the finest
                    people in our country, and I'm shocked to hear such prejudice and, I would say,
                    even racism among young officers. It's just unacceptable.” I was chastened. Then
                    when Congressman Celler left, we were lined up at the airplane to see him off
                    and he went along, shaking hands. To my delight, he came to me and said, “Well,
                    all right. Goodbye to you, Mr. Matthews. I hope you can make a success of your
                    career despite your obvious faults.” My colleague Freeman Matthews, was
                    considerably less amused by the mix up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that the Refugee Relief Program was very important
                        as a sort of historical note because it was the incubator for a whole group
                        of Foreign Service Officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Indeed, it was, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved up to Rome after a relatively short time
                        [in Palermo].</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, we did. What happened was that Bill Boswell, who was later Director
                    of Security for some time and Deputy Chief of Mission [DCM] in Cairo, was at
                    that point the Administrative Counselor in [the Embassy in] Rome. Boswell got
                    the idea — and part of it came from Bill Crockett, who was his deputy there — of
                    giving these promising young officers, who had just come into the Service, and
                    give them a chance to move up into other positions in Italy. He thought, “Why
                    don't we use them in other work where we need staff and train them in the
                    process?” So there was quite a migration of these new officers, after a year or
                    a year and a half in Palermo and Naples, to other positions in Italy. I went to
                    Rome to be Assistant Commercial Attach�. I was later replaced in that job by
                    Nick Veliotes who had come to Naples some time after we arrived in Palermo. Sam
                    Gammon went to the Consulate General in Milan. Sam Lewis went to [the Consulate
                    in] Florence. I think that one or two others came up to [the Embassy in] Rome.
                    Freeman Matthews went to [the Consulate in] Zurich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of these officers, by the way, have been interviewed
                        or are in the process of being interviewed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was a USIS [United States Information Service] officer, a very
                    excellent man, Paul Wheeler, who went to [the Consulate in] Trieste. Sam Wise,
                    who was one of the young officers there [in Palermo], has since retired and
                    become the director of the Congressional side of the CSCE [Conference on
                    Security and Cooperation in Europe] operation. He has been doing that for 10
                    years or so. He also went to Trieste from Palermo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Ambassador when you were in Rome?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: At first it was Clare Boothe Luce and then, subsequently, David
                    Zellerbach, of Crown-Zellerbach, the paper company. It was a fascinating time in
                    Rome, too, because Mrs. Luce was so committed to a direct confrontation with and
                    opposition to communism in Italy. She spent a lot of her time opposing the CGIL
                    [Italian General Confederation of Labor], the labor union controlled by the
                    Left. She was a remarkable woman, really — a person of extraordinary presence,
                    the very definition of the word “charisma.” She was exciting to work for,
                    although I think, in retrospect, as we now look back more objectively at the
                    Cold War, that she was almost a caricature of our pervasive American phobia over
                    Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing what, mainly economic and commercial
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HARROP: I began doing straight commercial work and took American trade missions
                    around the country. It was very interesting. We had a number of trade missions
                    of experienced, American business people came to Italy. Our concern, which seems
                    bizarre today in the 1990s, was to help them export to America. We would take
                    buyers from [U.S.] department stores, Americans expert with various types of
                    specialized equipment, managers from our steel industry. They would meet with
                    [Italian] industrialists and manufacturers, farmers, and others, and advise them
                    on how they could best gain access to the American market to earn dollars [for
                    Italy]. Of course, in later years, all of the experience I have had with
                    commercial matters was exactly in the opposite direction. I was in that work in
                    Rome for, perhaps, 10 months. And then for the next two years I was an economic
                    officer with main responsibility for a very interesting sector, energy, at a
                    time when the first internationally financed nuclear reactor was being built.
                    The World Bank invited bids on a nuclear reactor for Italy, and American,
                    British and French firms competed, a most interesting thing for me to be engaged
                    in. It was also the era when a man named Enrico Mattei was the very energetic,
                    activist head of the Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi. The Italian energy and
                    petroleum industry was shattering the historic “50-50” split in the Middle East
                    by offering a much larger percentage of the proceeds and ownership of oil
                    exploration to Arab governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all involved with Mattei? By the way, there's
                        a very interesting account of oil developments and Mattei in a book called,
                        I think, “The Prize.” What was the Embassy's evaluation of Mattei at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Our perception was largely one of self interest, trying to protect the
                    American oil industry against Mattei, feeling that he was opening a kind of
                    “Pandora's Box” in these Gulf, Middle Eastern, and Maghreb countries. We thought
                    that it was going to be very hard to close this box and that the future of
                    Western energy economics was likely to suffer some mighty buffets from Mattei.
                    So we regarded ourselves as opposed to him, and I spent much time endeavoring to
                    frustrate his operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, with reference to the energy field, was there any
                        significant opposition to nuclear energy in Italy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HARROP: It was so new that I do not recall any major opposition. Certainly, there
                    were no significant public environmental or radiation concerns. The focus was
                    mostly on the cost of nuclear energy, which was considered very questionable.
                    This was a time, of course, when atomic energy was regarded with great optimism.
                    Later on, I was more involved with nuclear energy while working with EURATOM
                    [European Atomic Energy Commission] as the European Community first began to
                    pick up speed. There was even more this sense that the technology was going to
                    leap forward and that we were at the threshold of a marvelous new era — an era
                    which has not to this day, 35 years later, really unfolded. France is the only
                    major country today which has a large proportion of its energy provided by
                    nuclear power. But I do not recall that there were serious social or political
                    objections to nuclear energy, as such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning the CGIL, the communist labor
                        confederation. Was the CGIL “big” in the electrical industry? Was this
                        considered a problem, that communist hands might get close to nuclear
                        reactors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was not discussed in those terms, to my recollection. The Edison
                    Company, a private firm, was very important in electric power [in Italy], and
                    the chemicals giant Montecatini (which later merged with Edison) was also
                    engaged in the nuclear industry. ENI [National Hydrocarbons Agency] had not been
                    involved in electricity, but moved energetically into nuclear energy. The CGIL
                    was most active in the automotive, heavy equipment, and manufacturing
                    sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Edison was an Italian firm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes. This World Bank nuclear reactor project came along very well. The
                    major American bidders turned out to be General Electric and Westinghouse, the
                    two companies that were most advanced at the time. A French parastatal
                    consortium was trying hard to compete, as well as a British consortium. So there
                    were four serious competitors for this first, major, world contract, which was
                    thought of as being a milestone in the industry and a tremendous leg-up for
                    whoever won it — and for the type of reactor. Each company had a different type
                    of reactor: water and heavy water and gas cooled reactors of different types,
                    requiring different degrees of uranium enrichment. The American companies
                    finally won the bid, although, as I've mentioned, the French have since done
                    more than anyone else to develop this energy source.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an economic officer, you served under Clare Boothe Luce
                        and then Zellerbach. Could you talk to Communist officials or were they out
                        of bounds?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HARROP: We really did not speak to Communists — hardly at all. I think that a few
                    people in the Political Section were authorized to do that, but, by and large,
                    we didn't do it. The Political Section was quite active. Our Political Counselor
                    at the time was a man named V. Lansing Collins. There was one officer who was
                    responsible for dealings with the Socialists and with the Left. I think that he
                    felt a little bit under constraint from Mrs. Luce more than from David
                    Zellerbach. The Deputy Chief of the CIA Station in Rome at the time was Bill
                    Colby, who later went on to be the Director of Central Intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I grant that you were a junior officer in a large embassy,
                        but did you have the feeling that we were “meddling” in the politics of
                        Italy? Today Italy is somewhat in disarray and with the issue of corruption
                        and United States support of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] we had a
                        hand in the development of this whole...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that we were “meddling” very arrogantly in the politics of Italy
                    — to an unusual degree. As you say, I was not involved in that. As a junior
                    officer on the economic side I was more involved in working on economic and
                    commercial relations. An interesting phenomenon was the tremendous importance of
                    the United States. Any official American could have the ear of any Italian
                    official. In economic matters there was a fascination with American management
                    techniques, a scramble, a search for American investors and American markets.
                    There was, I think, a very real gratitude for the concern which the United
                    States showed in the redevelopment and rebuilding of Italy — the Marshall Plan
                    and all the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Ambassador Zellerbach? Did you get any
                        impression of his method of operation or his interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He was not an activist ambassador. He personally played a modest role in
                    the relations between the two countries. He was a very sharp contrast to the
                    assertive, incisive, and energetic Mrs. Luce.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Graham Martin there [at the Embassy in Rome] when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Graham Martin was not there when I was there. He came later. The head of
                    the Economic Section was a man named Henry Tasca, who later became Ambassador to
                    Morocco and to Greece.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was my Ambassador in Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HARROP: He was the Director of the very large USOM [United States Operations
                    Mission], the foreign assistance mission, as well as of the very large Economic
                    Section. He was later replaced by a man named Francis Deak, who was promoted
                    from within. The Economic Section of the American Embassy was an extremely
                    important and large operation at that time. It was not called AID [Agency for
                    International Development] at the time, but ICA [International Cooperation
                    Administration]. I've forgotten all the different names we've gone through to
                    refer to foreign assistance, which has been frequently redesigned in response to
                    its unpopularity with voters. In the 1950s we had productivity experts and all
                    sorts of technical people doing much the same kind of work in Italy that AID has
                    subsequently done in the developing world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Henry Tasca? He became a

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I thought he was a rather manipulative man, a very charming person. I
                    felt the same about him subsequently in Morocco, where he seemed sometimes more
                    engaged in representing King Hassan in Washington than vice versa. I was not
                    involved in his work in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Palermo in 1954. You were there, what, until

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I left Rome in the late fall of 1958 to come back to Washington. I came
                    back under protest because by that time I had become fascinated with energy
                    questions and with the politics of energy — atomic energy particularly. I was
                    asked to come back to be in the Office of Personnel in the State Department,
                    handling personnel assignments. I sent back an imprudent cable to say that if I
                    had wanted to be in personnel work I would have joined Westinghouse, not the
                    State Department. I said that I wasn't interested in that. I was told in no
                    uncertain terms that if I wanted to continue my career in the State Department,
                    I should come back and work in Personnel. So I did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is interesting because we certainly were lacking in
                        FSO's who were interested in energy matters. Be that as it may, the system

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HARROP: I was initially a placement officer and later was Deputy Director of the
                    Office of Washington Assignments. The personnel system was handled through the
                    Personnel Operations Division, which was organized geographically. Different
                    sections were in charge of assignments to different parts of the world. My
                    section happened to be Washington. In fact, the Department brought back to
                    Washington other officers with whom I had entered the service. Both Freeman
                    Matthews and Sam Gammon came back to work in that area. Don Junior [Lewis D.
                    Junior], who had also been with us in Palermo, came back to work in Personnel.
                    One or two others from our group were also there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an old Foreign Service hand, what was your impression
                        of the Personnel apparatus of which you were part? This is back in the late
                        1950's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was a system which functioned in a way which later so angered
                    [Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger. There tended to be geographic hierarchies,
                    so that the Arabists were a group and Latin America was thought of as being a
                    particularly hermetic cylinder. Many people were trying to get into Western
                    European operations. I myself became fascinated by the “Atlantic” idea,
                    particularly European integration. I moved into that area from Personnel,
                    although I stayed for only a short period.</p>
                <p>There was a system of listing all of the vacancies coming up in the near future
                    and then comparing this list with the preference sheets, the famous “April Fool”
                    sheets that people made up as to what they'd like to do. We tried to match these
                    up. Once a week there was an all-morning conference or panel session, as it was
                    called, at which representatives of each of these different areas would debate
                    individual assignments. There would be heavy competition for the people with the
                    best reputations. There would be a negative competition to avoid those who were
                    thought of — for whatever reason — as being “weaker” performers. It was very
                    much a “turf” debate and involved real competition for people. Gradually, they
                    would all be assigned. The individual had relatively little to say as to where
                    he was going. There was relatively little inclination to challenge assignments
                    that were made.</p>
                <p>I think that, in some respects, this system worked pretty well. In other respects
                    it did not. While I was there, there was recognition that the career development
                    of individuals was not sufficiently attended to. So another segment of positions
                    was established — career development officers — who were to sit on the panels
                    and look at the process more specifically from the individual officer's point of
                    view, rather than in terms of the national interest or work requirements, in
                    deciding where people should go.</p>
                <p>This process could be accused, perhaps, of being a bit disorganized. On the other
                    hand it did function.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're still talking about the late 1950's. Getting people
                        to come to Washington — and you were a case in point — was a little hard,
                        wasn't it? It was harder to get people to come to a Washington job...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, and this was also the time of — I've forgotten the exact dates of
                    the Wriston Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It started in about 1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: This was a time of a huge expansion of Washington positions, relative to
                    those overseas. The Foreign Service moved from a proportion of probably four or
                    five jobs overseas to one in the Department to a question of about 40 jobs in
                    Washington to 60 jobs overseas. This would mean that you would spend about 40
                    percent of your time in Washington and 60 percent abroad. In recent years with
                    some people it was more like 50-50. So that was quite a change. The “culture” of
                    the Foreign Service had been that people who came into it expected they'd be
                    mainly living overseas. There was some resistance, but gradually people began to
                    understand that if you wanted to have an impact on policy, perhaps the best
                    place to be was Washington. In my view the work was more difficult, more
                    demanding, less well compensated financially, and certainly more fatiguing in
                    Washington, with fewer diversions, less interest and variety than overseas.
                    However, ambitious people began to see that Washington was probably a place they
                    should focus on if they wanted to get ahead in their careers. That view was
                    beginning to be appreciated by 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In my interviews some of the people who have done very
                        well, in Foreign Service terms, seem to have served as staff assistants to
                        some of the principal officers of the State Department. Did you get involved
                        in arranging for people to go into these positions, working for the Deputy
                        Under Secretary and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, that came up from time to time. I can't remember whether it was Mrs.
                    Luce or Mr. Zellerbach who wanted me to be staff assistant to the Ambassador in
                    Rome. I think it may have been just as Mrs. Luce was leaving, which would have
                    meant working for Ambassador Zellerbach. I declined that because I was so
                    interested in the energy sector I was covering. There was no problem involved in
                    turning the offer down. No one said, “For heaven's sake, you must do that if
                    you're asked to.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The area then regarded as more important in the Department than special assistant
                    positions was the Executive Secretariat. The Executive Secretariat at that time
                    enjoyed a “mystique” and a sense of importance which it has lost, to some
                    extent, in subsequent years. But in the '50s and '60s to be selected for the
                    Executive Secretariat was regarded as a tremendous honor. In fact, being
                    selected for the Personnel Operations Division was also something of an honor,
                    as we realized after we got there, because that office was in a position to
                    choose whom it wanted to staff itself. They looked for people that they thought
                    would do well. So when this group of young people whom I mentioned came back to
                    find ourselves in Personnel, which had so dismayed us, we learned that, in fact,
                    it was a flattering assignment, because the people looking at all of those
                    available had felt that we were the ones that they wanted to have join them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had a stint there some years later and I realized that
                        you could dine on it for the rest of your career, knowing the intricacies of
                        how assignments went, which was a very important...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, learning how the organization operated was something that you could
                    do there as well as anywhere else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Personnel until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Until about 1961. I was there for about two and a half years and then
                    moved to a position in the regional affairs office (RA) of the Bureau of
                    European Affairs. While I was there, EUR was reorganized into two separate
                    offices: Regional Politico-Military Affairs and Regional Economic Affairs. I
                    replaced Arthur Hartman in that position. We had two desk officers for the
                    European Community. One was Richard Vine, who focused upon the European Economic
                    Community, and Hartman, later I, who focused on EURATOM. At that time the two
                    organizations appeared to be of equal importance. EURATOM was thought of by most
                    people as the likely engine of unification in Europe because it had the
                    advantage, unlike the Coal and Steel Community and unlike the Economic Community
                    itself, of being a new field in which there were no existing structures and
                    rigidities, no organizations established in a national format. There was great
                    hope attached to it. Some of the most enterprising of the French, Italian, and
                    German sponsors of [European] integration were focusing on the EURATOM side —
                    people like Etienne Hirsch, Rene Foch, and many others.</p>
                <p>While I was there, it began to become evident that nuclear energy was not, in
                    fact, going to be as relatively important as had been hoped and predicted.
                    EURATOM receded substantially in importance compared to the Economic
                    Community.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, was there concern about the Germans
                        having anything to do with nuclear matters? This period was not all that
                        long after World War II. Nuclear energy was still connected to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was some anxiety about that. The concern for safeguards was
                    beginning to develop then, although non-proliferation and the IAEA
                    [International Atomic Energy Administration] came many years later. At that time
                    the focus was on nuclear research being done by multinational European regional
                    organizations, trying to lock the Germans in as part of international
                    institutions. This was the theme of European integration itself.</p>
                <p>Beneath the strategic purpose, the real interest in EURATOM was on the effort to
                    develop nuclear energy. People interested in the economics of it saw the atom as
                    a cheaper, effective energy source to stimulate the recovery of Europe. Others
                    saw it as the most likely vehicle for [European] integration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that while you were dealing with this you began
                        to see that it was perceived as an important matter. What was the cause of
                        this? Why wasn't nuclear energy growing as had been foreseen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that the economics [of nuclear energy] just did not begin to
                    improve, as many people had hoped they would. There had been an expectation that
                    technology would resolve more quickly the problems of [nuclear] enrichment, the
                    handling of nuclear waste, and the overall economics of the containment of
                    radiation. These things didn't happen. There was an expectation that we would
                    have major breakthroughs in direct use of the hydrogen atom — thermonuclear
                    energy — rather quickly. That hasn't happened to this day. This was a severe
                    disappointment in a very complex area of technology. When you compare the rate
                    of advance in nuclear energy and the rate of advance, say, in electronic
                    technology, the difference is quite striking. Progress in nuclear energy has
                    been very slow. As this became evident and as the economic questions of the
                    Common Market assumed greater importance, in the sense of moving toward making
                    the monetary systems, the tariff structure more compatible, and creating
                    arrangements for freeing the movement of people across borders, the whole
                    process of European integration began to gain real headway. It became evident
                    that economic and trade issues in the European Community were where political
                    progress was going to be made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there [the Bureau of European Affairs] in 1963. I
                        have you going out to Brussels.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, no, I actually left there early 1962 in what I would have to call a
                    “forced assignment,” because, to my astonishment, I was telephoned one morning
                    by the Director of Personnel, for whom I had been working before. He said,
                    “Hello, I'm surprised to find you there.” I said, “What do you mean?” He said,
                    “Well, you've been reassigned.” I said, “What are you talking about?” He said,
                    “You're supposed to be down in the Bureau of African Affairs. You're responsible
                    for economic matters having to do with the Congo and the Katanga secession.
                    You'd better get down there very quickly.” I was angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was saying it in a half humorous and half serious
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I was quite angry. I talked to the people in the Bureau of European
                    Affairs and said, “What in the world is going on? You can't do this.” But, no. A
                    lot of importance was being attached to the Congo at that time, as the current
                    focus of the Cold War. They'd given a kind of “hunting license” to the Bureau of
                    African Affairs. Sheldon Vance was then the Director of the Office of Central
                    African Affairs and had authority to get whomever he wanted. He knew me because
                    he had been Director of Near East and African assignments in Personnel when I
                    was working as Deputy Director of Washington assignments. He said that he wanted
                    me, and the Personnel people said, “All right.”</p>
                <p>So in a matter of hours I was switched over to a completely new field about which
                    I knew nothing. I had no interest in Africa, but found myself working on issues
                    which were entirely fresh to me with a very strong group of people. Sheldon
                    Vance was a powerful personality. He was replaced subsequently by G. McMurtrie
                    Godley. My other two colleagues on the desk were Frank Carlucci and Charles
                    Whitehouse. The three of us were the Congo desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Frank Carlucci had just come...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He had just come back from the Congo at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little sense of what you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: In the Bureau of African Affairs at that time?</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HARROP: We were dealing with the Katanga secession and how that related to the
                    central government of the Congo, how it related to the Soviet-American
                    competition for influence in Central Africa, and to the role of the UN in peace
                    keeping. There was active intelligence component. Economic questions were of
                    major importance. We had tremendous difficulties with the Belgians, reflected
                    interestingly in bureaucratic friction between the Bureau of African Affairs and
                    the Bureau of European Affairs over policy toward the Congo, toward the United
                    Nations, and toward the Katanga secession (which certainly had major elements of
                    a Belgian hand in it). So it was a fascinating period, and the year and a half I
                    spent there was one of the most interesting periods I can recall.</p>
                <p>I went from there to be the middle grade economic officer and deputy to the
                    Economic Counselor in Brussels, and continued to be the person in Brussels

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's come back to the Washington side. This was a battle
                        royal over Katanga, which was considered the “guts” of the Congo's wealth.
                        It was very much [under the influence of] Union Miniere [Upper Katanga
                        Mining Company]...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Union Miniere, or UMHK.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which wanted very much to keep this area out of the hands
                        of whatever passed for the central government of the Congo. You mentioned
                        before that you learned how battles are fought. Obviously, our people in the
                        Bureau of European Affairs wanted to keep Belgium happy because it is part
                        of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] and all that. From your vantage
                        point, you were watching this battle going on. How did things work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were really three different bureaucratic power centers and three
                    different interests. One was, as you described, the European side, the NATO
                    side, the sense that Belgium was an ally of ours in Europe, that Belgium was a
                    kind of proxy for the British and the French in African, or colonial, terms. We
                    had broader and more important American national interests in our relations with
                    Western Europe and our principal allies than we had to any degree in Central
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Then we had the Bureau of African Affairs, which tended to be, I would say, more
                    idealistic, particularly under G. Mennen Williams during the Kennedy
                    Administration. There was a feeling of morality, the importance of democracy and
                    self determination, American responsibility for helping to free subjugated
                    peoples from colonialism, and so forth, as well as deep resentment at what was
                    perceived to be European self-interest manipulation of the tribal frictions that
                    existed in Africa.</p>
                <p>The third power center was the newly-created Bureau of International Organization
                    Affairs...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The United Nations was playing a major role in the former Belgian Congo.
                    This role led to the first deployment of blue-helmeted, United Nations forces to
                    try to stop hostilities and actually, so people in IO thought, to end the
                    Katanga secession.</p>
                <p>There were these three major centers. The Bureau of International Organization
                    Affairs was under Joe Sisco, who later became a major figure. “Woody” Wallner
                    was his deputy. Then there was Governor [G. Mennen] Williams, who was not,
                    himself, a powerful or effective bureaucratic infighter but who was a stubborn
                    man well supported by some skillful diplomats. On the European side there was a
                    group of experienced and tough Foreign Service Officers who saw policy through
                    their own experience and wanted to defend their understanding of U.S. national
                    interests. So there was much debate and much discussion. There were bitter
                    fights over the wording of cables of instructions going out to the field and a
                    repeated need for the Under Secretary or the Secretary to call the people
                    involved together to try to reconcile differences and see if we couldn't develop
                    a concerted American position on these matters. It was a fascinating time, my
                    first of many experiences with efforts to resolve deep policy differences within
                    the U.S. Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you subscribe to the concept of a unified Congo at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, I did. Whether this was a result of my coming under the influence of
                    the culture that I was in, — “standing where you sit” — or whether it was by
                    intellectual analysis, I don't know. I was impressed, even on that first
                    exposure to Africa, by the interesting argument that the actual, ethnic makeup
                    of that continent is so jumbled that, unless you stay with the national
                    boundaries established almost haphazardly for quite irrelevant reasons, you're
                    going to be in for chaos. You have to defend those borders. I found that a
                    rather persuasive argument. If the Katanga secession had succeeded, there would
                    have been no end to secessions elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We went through somewhat the same thing with Biafra. You
                        were talking about our basic policy of considering the chaos which would
                        ensue if we let Africa break down. Was this view pretty well agreed to by
                        those in the Bureau of African Affairs at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HARROP: I think so. It became even more of a doctrine in subsequent years. You
                    mentioned the Biafra case — and, of course, there have been others. I don't
                    think that one should regard the Eritrea situation in quite the same terms,
                    since that had been a separate, artificial combination [of territory] arranged
                    by the Italians. However, the feeling right along, and I believe well founded,
                    is that if you once let Africa begin to reorganize itself along ethnic lines —
                    and there will always be a tendency to do that — it will be hard to retain any
                    effective policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself sort of “nose to nose” with people
                        at your particular level in the Bureau of European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, although I did not have enough seniority to be in the real
                    struggles. The working level fellow in the Bureau of European Affairs who was
                    the Director for the Benelux countries [Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg]
                    was Bob Beaudry. He subsequently became a very good friend of mine — in fact, he
                    became Political Counselor in [the Embassy in] Brussels a year or two later when
                    I became deputy to the Economic Counselor there. He and his wife are good
                    friends of ours to this day. But there was a heavy ill feeling at the time in
                    the Department.</p>
                <p>There was a sense that there was a lot at stake. The Congo was the focus of world
                    attention at the time, the stage of the Cold War. The United Nations was
                    absolutely devoted to this question. Dag Hammarskjold [late secretary general of
                    the UN] met his death, flying out there. We arranged American support for the
                    transportation of United Nations troops. There was a big American investment in
                    terms of political capital and funds. President Kennedy was personally
                    interested in the whole subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it from the economic side, how did you see the
                        economics of Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The focus at that time was so much upon the [Katanga] secession [issue]
                    that my work was mainly to do with the economics of Katanga, how Katanga would
                    survive, how the central government would be able to survive without the
                    resources of Katanga, which was the great center of the copper industry. There
                    was also the major issue of what was known as the “Congo portfolio.” Under
                    Belgian colonial rule there was a huge portfolio worth well over $1.0 billion of
                    equity in many companies engaged in mining, agriculture, commerce. The most
                    important investments included diamond, copper, cobalt, gold and tin mining
                    companies operating in the Congo and marketing Congolese products outside. The
                    question was under what terms would the new, central government of the Congo
                    obtain the rights to this major portfolio of assets. It was a huge struggle and,
                    of course, a lot of the assets were in Katanga under Katangan authority. There
                    were several formulas put together for the strangulation of Katanga economically
                    as well as politically and militarily, to force them back into the country. In
                    the end, of course, those [strategies] succeeded.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>It was a great political problem for the United States because the central
                    government, at least under [Patrice] Lumumba, before I got there, was seen as
                    being to the “Left,” heavily supported by the Soviets (albeit elected). It
                    became a kind of a political Left-Right struggle, among other things. We saw a
                    challenge to try to encourage a government in Leopoldville which was compatible
                    with our views and with which we could work in trying to put down the [Katanga]
                    secession and reunify the country. This brought us into inescapable
                    confrontation with the Belgians, supported generally by the Europeans, who were
                    “winking” at the [Katanga] secession.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, I didn't see it in those terms. I was still following these issues.
                    In fact, it was while I was in Brussels that we had a visit from Governor
                    Harriman, who was then Under Secretary for Political Affairs, or Deputy Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs. That [visit] involved organizing the major
                    exercise that was called “Dragon Rouge” [Red Dragon], using U.S. C-130
                    [aircraft] to send Belgian forces to Stanleyville to rescue more than 100
                    hostages there, including the American Consul. What was his name? Hoyt, Michael
                    Hoyt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Brussels in 1963. You were basically the
                        “African” man in the Economic Section [of the Embassy]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, I did more than that. I dealt with Belgian national accounts and I
                    did a good deal of commercial work and followed Belgian economic relations with
                    the United States and the EC. I was the number two man in a three-man Economic
                    Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Economic Counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Chris Petrow, who later became Economic Minister in the Embassy in Paris
                    and Director of Mexican Affairs in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that you had never taken any economics
                        courses when you were in college. Did this come up to haunt you at all or
                        did you find that economics reporting and the work we did really didn't
                        require that type of background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HARROP: I would have been better served if I had had some basic economics. I took
                    one economics course when I was in graduate school, when I thought I might be
                    going into the Foreign Service. However, I regarded economics then as a specious
                    discipline — and still do, to some extent. I believe there is limited
                    understanding of economic forces in the world. The American presidential
                    election [of 1992] had so many, interesting economic elements, with economics,
                    with President Bush almost stating that he had nothing to do with economics and
                    with the business cycle in the country and that we should wait around a bit and
                    things would become better. Clinton based his campaign on economic conditions in
                    the country. By the time Clinton entered office, even by the time of the
                    election, the recession had already essentially turned around, without the
                    government having much influence. So you wonder whether governments have as much
                    of a role in the economic field as you might think. I was struck by the fact
                    that, although I did not study economics to any extent when I was in college, I
                    took an 11-week “cram course” [in preparation for the Foreign Service
                    examination], in which economics played a very small part. That was before I
                    took the one course in graduate school. I got a grade of 88, or something like
                    that, in the economics part of the Foreign Service exam — higher than I received
                    on subjects that I knew much more about. That persuaded me that economics was
                    something of an artificial discipline, that by learning a little terminology one
                    could pass as an “economist”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you. I consider economics a little bit like
                        astrology. It is very good at explaining what happened but not very good at
                        explaining what will happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that it would have helped if I had known more about economic
                    definitions. The language of economics would have helped me, particularly in
                    doing the national accounts work in Belgium. That was fairly sophisticated work.
                    I had some difficulty with it. However, on the whole, I think that the work on
                    economics which you do in the Foreign Service up until recently — it's changing
                    now — did not require an academic, economics background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get a different perspective or did you find
                        yourself the “African man” sitting in a sort of hostile field? Particularly
                        coming from where you had been, in the Bureau of African Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was no sense of that, really. I may have overstated the degree of
                    bureaucratic hostility. There had been tempers that flared. There had been some
                    real feelings and fights. People were accused of disingenuous modification of
                    language in cables. It had been heated at times, but not to the extent that I
                    might have had any feeling of being in the “enemy camp” when I went to
                    Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand, but, after all, this is how issues are
                        thrashed out. The Foreign Service has a tendency of trying to “smooth them
                        over.” Once in a while they don't get smoothed over. Did you see the Katanga
                        issue from a different perspective when you were in the Embassy in
                        Brussels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No I don't think so. Several things occurred when I got to Brussels which
                    did not lead to a change in my viewpoint. One was a confirmation of the cynicism
                    of the Belgian financial interests in their whole relationship to the politics
                    of Africa. I had a sense almost of horror when I realized that. The Belgian
                    colonial system was the most inhumane and selfish colonial regime of any in the
                    world. It was an appalling situation, to which most Belgian participants were
                    able to close their eyes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like “The Heart of Darkness.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, it was really appalling. So that feeling was underlined and
                    confirmed in Belgium. Also, however, I developed a much better understanding of
                    the way in which Belgians saw Africa and rather loved Africa. There was a real
                    difference. The French, who had the most colonies and probably the largest
                    presence in Africa, tended to go there for short periods of time. They still
                    regarded themselves as citizens of Metropolitan France. They went to live there
                    [in Africa] for a time and then returned [to France]. The Belgians also took a
                    relatively short term view of Africa — even more than the French. Most of the
                    Belgians did not stay in Africa for any length of time. There always was a
                    certain number that set out roots, but, on the whole, they would go to Africa,
                    establish plantations, work in the mines or something else, frequently remain
                    for most of their lives, and then return home. The British were very different.
                    The British really had become Kenyans and Rhodesians. Of course, those parts of
                    Africa have climates which are most attractive to people from the temperate
                    zones. But the British attitude was very different. I think that the Belgian
                    sense of impatience with the Africans was more marked. There was almost no
                    effort in the Congo to bring the Africans into Belgian or European culture and
                    society at all. Nor was there really an effort to develop the tools and
                    machinery of government, as the British so emphatically did with their police
                    forces, their judicial systems, and their administrative schools in all of their
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>The French really tried to make the Africans culturally French. They emphasized
                    French culture, language and French law, “Epanouissement”. There was a lot of
                    integration under the French, less so with the British, and almost none at all
                    with the Belgians. The Belgians, in my view, were the most paternalistic and,
                    therefore, the most patronizing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel as to why the Belgians were so

                <p>HARROP: Well, I think it's partly the fact that Belgium is such a small country.
                    A lot is explained by that. They don't think of themselves as a distinct culture
                    or civilization, as the French or British do. The French and the Flemish
                    languages are not “their” languages. It's a quite different psychology under
                    which they live. They don't think of themselves as large enough or important
                    enough to have that sort of influence, although, in fact, in many ways, the
                    [Belgian] Congo was the largest and richest of all the European colonies in
                    Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: In Brussels, yes. But Ridgway Knight was also Ambassador for part of the
                    time. Ambassador MacArthur was there for about a year and a half, and Knight,
                    about a year and a half. I guess it was about half and half.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Ambassador MacArthur?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He was a man of extraordinary personal energy, dynamism, drive,
                    forcefulness, and ambition. I would say that he was a man without as good “ears”
                    as he might have had. He was not a sensitive person. That was a case in which a
                    Diplomat's wife was really a liability to him because of her very erratic
                    behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was one of the well-known “dragons” of the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, I could tell you anecdotes about that, but there's no particular
                    reason to repeat them. Some really extraordinary things happened to us there [in
                    Brussels]. However, I did feel that Ambassador MacArthur was an accomplished
                    professional diplomat. I remember, in particular, one incident in his office
                    when we were trying to work out something which had to do with the Congo. We
                    were at odds with the Belgians on an issue there, as we usually were, since, I
                    would say, the world view of the Bureau of African Affairs was the one that
                    prevailed generally in the end over the views of the Bureau of European Affairs.
                    We found ourselves increasingly in confrontation with the former colonial
                    powers.</p>
                <p>We were working out a way to express to the Belgians that we simply did not agree
                    at all with their point of view and wanted to insist on its being changed. I
                    remember watching and listening in great admiration as Ambassador Douglas
                    MacArthur dictated a memorandum to Foreign Minister Spaak. This was diplomacy in
                    its purest form: language which simply and completely rejected what the Belgians
                    were trying to achieve, but with such grace that you couldn't say that here he
                    was contradicting them, or there, he's thrown it back in their face. Not at all.
                    It was a masterful draft. I felt that I had learned a great deal that
                    afternoon.</p>

                        ambassador. Were you looking in particular at chiefs of mission but others

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Certainly. I was not consciously thinking of myself as an ambassador at
                    that time, but I learned different things from many people. As you go along, you
                    see approaches that succeed and those that do not. I guess Ambassador Marshall
                    Green was the most important to me subsequently in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Ambassador Ridgway Knight? He was another
                        professional diplomat, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Ridgway Knight was a professional diplomat, although somehow he did not
                    seem to be as much of a professional. Ridgway Knight had been raised in France
                    and, throughout his life, spoke English with a French accent. He was quite an
                    effective ambassador. He lacked the ostentatious self-confidence of Douglas
                    MacArthur, but both of them had great grace in dealing with Belgians. I think
                    that both were very effective. After MacArthur had an unsuccessful tour in
                    Congressional Relations and went to Iran for a couple of years, he subsequently
                    retired in Belgium. Their daughter had married a Belgian while they were there.
                    The MacArthur's lived in retirement in Belgium for some years. Knight had a
                    sense of cultural affinity with Europeans and with Belgians. Knight was not a
                    “man of the people” and did not easily pick up popular currents. I remember that
                    he was particularly grateful to me on one occasion. I was writing a speech for
                    him. The two leading Belgian football [soccer] teams were and are “Anderlech” of
                    Brussels and “Standard” of Liege. At some point in the speech [which I was
                    writing for him] I used the metaphor of Anderlech and Standard. Ambassador
                    Knight really didn't understand it, but the audience roared, applauded, and
                    laughed. Afterwards he asked me to come up and see him. He thanked me for that
                    brilliant remark. He said, “By the way, what was it all about?” He wasn't really
                    aware of the nitty-gritty of Belgian life. I enjoyed working for him. He was an
                    attractive and intelligent person.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you finally got yourself off to Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, I visited there because I was following African affairs. At that
                    time the Department of State had greater resources [for travel] than it has now.
                    To make such a trip would be almost out of the question now. I was able to get
                    official orders and spend about 15 days in the [ex-Belgian] Congo, where I had
                    never been, to meet some of the people there and to see at first hand some of
                    the economic and political questions I was following [at the Embassy] in
                    Brussels. I stopped off and saw Ambassador Godley, who was then in Leopoldville.
                    I had worked for him during my last months in Washington. I then went out to
                    Lubumbashi and saw...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was still Elisabethville at the time. I stayed with the Consul there,
                    an old friend of mine, Arthur Tienken. Then I returned to Kinshasa to visit
                    Ambassador Godley again. Godley invited General Mobutu to breakfast, and I first
                    met him there. It was an interesting experience. I also met others. Moise
                    Tshombe, former Prime Minister of separate Katanga, strangely enough, now Prime
                    Minister of the Congo itself. He later, of course, was captured and exiled.
                    Before I left, Ambassador Godley said, “Why don't you come down here follow to
                    Tienken as Principal Officer in Elisabethville?” I must say, this possibility
                    hadn't occurred to me, but it appealed right away. I said, “Sure, I'd like
                    to.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Elisabethville in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: 1966. I spent three years in Brussels, 1963-66, and then two years in
                    Elisabethville, whose name was changed to Lubumbashi just as I arrived. It was a
                    tumultuous period. We had a Consulate of about 15 people altogether, including a
                    small military advisory sub-mission under the military mission in Leopoldville.
                    It was a very difficult time. There were a couple of “cooked-up” invasions of
                    mercenaries from Angola. There was a mercenary “rebellion” against the central
                    government of the Congo, and periods of violence and harsh repression in
                    Lubumbashi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These all show the fine hand of Belgian...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, not really. It was not entirely clear. The mercenaries coming up from
                    Angola must have had public or private Belgian or other European backing, but it
                    was becoming a very complex pattern by that time. Mobutu acceded to power while
                    we were there and has been in office ever since. It was very dangerous for a
                    time. The Second Paracommando Battalion from Leopoldville was sent down to
                    discipline Katanga. The central government was always afraid of a renewed effort
                    at secession by the regional ethnic groups, leaving aside anything that the
                    Belgians might attempt. I don't want to leave the impression that the Katanga
                    secession was a Belgian operation; the Belgians went along with, winked at, and
                    somewhat supported an initiative that was going to happen anyway because of the
                    tribal mix of the Congo. The Lunda tribe, of which Tshombe was the leader, was
                    probably going to do that. And the central government were always afraid that it
                    was going to happen again — they still are, to this day. So they [the central
                    government] sent this very rough group down, armed with the most modern weapons
                    from the Fabriqu� Nationale de Belgique [Belgian National Arms Factory] and just
                    wrought havoc in Katanga, which became a perilous place to be. My family very
                    narrowly escaped being shot in our own house.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The Governor of Katanga at the time was a vicious villain named John
                    Foster Manzikala, named after John Foster Dulles, amazingly. He came from a
                    Presbyterian family. Wasn't the Dulles family — I'm pretty sure that they were
                    Presbyterians. Anyhow, this Manzikala, who was really unbalanced — a
                    bloodthirsty, cruel man — declared a curfew for whites (”Europeans”).
                    Furthermore, they could not have any lights on in their houses. There were
                    several thousand Europeans living in the area at the time. So with this wild,
                    heavily armed, and primitive battalion of paracommandos there, all of the white
                    residents of Katanga were cowering in their houses with their lights out at
                    night, hearing gunfire all over town with undisciplined soldiers parading
                    around. A group of them, drunken and menacing, came walking up our driveway
                    toward our house. These fellows were displaying their guns. We were just sitting
                    there in the dark, looking out the window at them. I had a pistol, though I
                    don't know whether I wanted to use it or not. They came up, drunk as lords,
                    rolling around, brandishing their weapons. Then they decided for the better and
                    walked away again. I think we certainly would have been dead if they had entered
                    the house.</p>
                <p>On another occasion, a night or two before that, one of our younger sons and I
                    were out in the backyard. We heard the thud of a shell which landed a few feet
                    away in our garden, a dud miraculously. It was an absolutely frightening
                    experience.</p>
                <p>This was a very, very awkward period. At one time a curfew was set from
                    Leopoldville for a certain hour. The country is so large that there is a time
                    difference between the East, where Lubumbashi is, and Leopoldville. So there was
                    a knot of Belgians, Italians, and Greeks in a cafe about half an hour before the
                    curfew was to begin. The security forces, the Army, thought that the curfew
                    should begin according to local time, not Kinshasa time. So they picked these
                    Europeans up, put them in a truck, and took them out into the country and shot
                    them. About eight people were just killed, which created a near panic. We
                    evacuated our wives and children and most of the staff for a time and sent them
                    down to Zambia. My wife and children stayed with the Edmondsons — Bill
                    Edmondson, who was then Deputy Chief of Mission in Zambia, and later Ambassador
                    to South Africa and my Deputy when I was Inspector General.</p>

                <p>HARROP: The United States is always a very important country, and particularly so
                    in Zaire because of the role it played there. I was able to stand up to Governor
                    Manzikala and got him to cancel the curfew for Europeans. I became kind of a
                    folk hero to the Belgians and [other] Europeans there because they viewed me as
                    the man who had been able to relieve them of some of their greatest concerns. We
                    could do things like that because we were important to the Zairians. Mobutu has
                    always behaved as if the support of the United States was crucial. In recent
                    years I've come to the conclusion that the United States was never as important
                    to the politics of Zaire as he [Mobutu] said we were, whether he believed it or
                    not, or as we thought we were. But that is a separate issue.</p>
                <p>We also had C-130's, large transport aircraft, in Leopoldville. I'd arranged to
                    have them come down to Katanga for a show of force during the period of greatest
                    tension. They flew in. I remember driving out to the airport with Governor
                    Manzikala and the chief of security for Katanga province, Major Mika. There was
                    a dramatic incident on the way. It was night, and our car was stopped at a
                    roadblock. The Governor decided a soldier was not sufficiently respectful to
                    him. We were in his blue Mercedes-Benz. He stopped when challenged but would not
                    continue until the soldier was taken out and beaten virtually to a pulp before
                    him. Then we were able to proceed to the airport. The man at the roadblock had
                    been instructed to stop all vehicles. Manzikala had driven up, and all the
                    soldier could see were headlights coming toward him. He'd stepped out with his
                    gun and said, “Stop!” Manzikala barked, “You're talking to the Governor of your
                    province and you're going to regret that.” Anyway, it was a great pleasure for
                    me to hear those American planes overhead and see our soldiers jump out and take
                    positions around their aircraft. It was a little show of force which served our
                    purposes tremendously at that dangerous moment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've conducted a fairly long interview which actually
                        hasn't been completed yet with Terry McNamara — about his time in the Congo.
                        How about your relations with the Embassy? Were they supportive? Here you
                        were in a very difficult situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The Embassy provided full support. Ambassador Mac Godley's relationship
                    with Mobutu was complex and difficult, as all ambassadors' [relationships with
                    Mobutu] have been, including my own twenty years later. In late 1966 we had a
                    particularly bad day and night in Katanga. It looked as though the central
                    government's control might finally be dissolving, and the people might be rising
                    up against the central government forces there.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I received an IMMEDIATE, NIACT [Night Action] cable from Ambassador Godley asking
                    me please to go out and take a look around town. Mobutu was begging Ambassador
                    Godley to let him know what was happening in Katanga. So I did. I was rather
                    nervous, but drove around town to assess the security situation. In fact, it was
                    rather quiet. I went back [to the Consulate] and prepared a report for
                    Ambassador Godley to share with Mobutu. This was sent under difficult
                    circumstances. My only communications person was a superb worker — in fact, I
                    was able subsequently to get him a double promotion. He had been out that night
                    at a big beer party and was drunk. So I had to call him back in — it was a
                    Sunday night, I think — to prepare the message. He had the most terrible time
                    with the old-fashioned, encryption system, punching out the messages. He was
                    just drinking coffee, perspiring, and in agony over it. He had had no reason to
                    expect that he would be coming in, but he shouldn't have taken on as much
                    alcohol as he did.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we finally got this message out. Godley went to reassure Mobutu that the
                    situation was resolved. But then, within a few weeks of that time, Godley, under
                    instructions, went in to put some new pressure on Mobutu. The lot of the
                    American Ambassador is to put pressure on Mobutu in Zaire on human rights and
                    corruption issues, economic policy, UN votes and any of hundreds of other
                    matters. Although it was never so announced publicly, Godley was expelled by
                    Mobutu. Godley radioed me to say, “I'm leaving. I wanted to let you know that.
                    Carry on.” Then the Charg� d'Affaires for a long time after that was Robert O.
                    Blake. Godley was finally replaced — we allowed Mobutu to stew a bit, as we did
                    later when he expelled Dean Hinton — by Bob McBride, who proved a very
                    uncomfortable — I would say very unhappy — Ambassador to Zaire. He'd always
                    worked in Europe. His last three jobs had been as Director of Western European
                    Affairs, Minister and Deputy Chief of Mission in Madrid, and Minister and Deputy
                    Chief of Mission in Paris. The Zaire job was a grueling shock for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a continuing theme that goes around about people
                        who hit Africa at least during the period from 1960 through 1980, at the
                        pinnacle of their careers, and particularly at difficult posts. It didn't
                        work out very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No. Bob McBride had a difficult time. He was dealing with Mobutu, who had
                    named himself President by then, and with Foreign Minister Justin Bomboko, who
                    was a most difficult fellow in a very different way. Ambassador McBride told me
                    one day, “I am awakened at all hours of the night, either by the megalomaniac or
                    by the schizophrenic. I never know which one will be on the other end of the
                    line with some crazy ultimatum.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HARROP: I left there in 1968 — again, not terribly pleased to be leaving because
                    I came back to be assigned to Princeton University for a year of training.
                    Princeton was my home. It was a puzzling assignment. There were other things I
                    would rather have done, but I adjusted to it, and it became a most interesting
                    and, especially from a family point of view, very fulfilling year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Lubumbashi, what did you feel about the
                        direction of Zaire and all of that? This was your first real exposure to it
                        on the ground. Certainly, it was a very difficult time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I felt that Zaire was in for extended crises. By that time Katanga had
                    been renamed Shaba by Mobutu. Whether Shaba was going to remain within Zaire was
                    unclear. While I was there [in Lubumbashi], the Union Miniere was nationalized
                    and renamed “Gecamines” although the Belgian engineers and administrators
                    continued to manage the company, many now under contract to the central
                    government. Their numbers were dwindling and their authority was circumscribed.
                    Whether they were going to be able to continue [to work there] was unclear. In
                    fact, no one really thought the mines could function for long. That picture has
                    become more difficult over the years, with corruption becoming absolutely
                    monumental, although for 25 years the mines kept operating and exports
                    continued. Mobutu has been simply stealing money from Gecamines all the time,
                    tens of millions of dollars a year. The situation has gotten worse, year by
                    year. As of 1993 the company is hardly operating at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about Mobutu, as you saw it at that time?
                        Was he considered to be the “hope” of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, he was the “hope,” in the sense that he was the only person strong
                    enough to unify the country, after a fashion, and keep the Army behind him. He
                    appeared to be the most skillful and the most forceful politician, but it would
                    never have occurred to me that he would last for 25 years more — almost 30 years
                    now. I never would have thought that. It seemed most unlikely, the history of
                    political turmoil in that country in the eight years since its independence, the
                    continual shuffling leaders, the insurgencies, assassinations and bloodshed had
                    to have its impact. Mobutu's mastery of the political system of his country has
                    been a phenomenon I would not have been able to predict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop here and then touch on your time
                        in Princeton and then go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 7, 1993, and we continue. When we left
                        off this interview, you were on your way to Princeton University, to the
                        Woodrow Wilson School. What were you doing there? I have you going there
                        from 1968 to 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, a few years before that the State Department had started to send
                    officers to participate in what was called the “Mid Career Program” at the
                    Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. Although it's called a “Mid Career Program,”
                    by Princeton — and they take about 15 people from government annually for a
                    sabbatical year, often including one or two Foreign Service officers — from the
                    State Department's point of view it's what we call “senior training.” That is,
                    it parallels — or in my case replans — an assignment to one of the war colleges
                    or to the Foreign Service Institute Senior Seminar Program.</p>
                <p>So I spent an interesting and stimulating year at Princeton. This was an unusual
                    situation, because the town was my boyhood home. I'd grown up in Princeton. At
                    that time my mother had a large house there, with no one in it but herself, so
                    our whole family moved in with her. We had our four sons with us and had a very
                    pleasant and interesting time, a year of re-Americanization for the boys after
                    five years of education in French.</p>
                <p>I think this sort of program is a very good idea. When you've been living under
                    tension overseas, as we had, or are fatigued from the strains of responsibility
                    and career, getting away to refresh yourself is a very sensible and worthwhile
                    measure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was 1968-69. The Vietnam War was going strong.
                        The protest against the war was still going on. Did this impact on you at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were very gifted, young graduate students at the [Woodrow Wilson]
                    School. They were very highly motivated people who were going more probably, at
                    that time, into domestic affairs than into international affairs. In fact, it
                    was an embarrassment to Princeton whose Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
                    International Affairs was based upon a large and anonymous donation, which had
                    stipulated equal attention to international and domestic matters. Princeton was
                    having difficulty in attracting people who were interested in international
                    affairs at that time. Our country was turning inward, to a certain extent. There
                    was some sense of pressure on Vietnam questions — with a rather liberal group of
                    young people at the university. On the other hand they were also mature,
                    motivated, and ambitious. They wanted to get out and into government. It was not
                    a matter of burning symbols and marches at all. It was a restrained atmosphere,
                    I would say, an atmosphere of intellectual concentration and hard work with
                    strong focus upon public policy issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of government and its problems, how did you find
                        coming up against the academic world? Here you'd been in [the Foreign
                        Service] for some time. Did you find yourself somewhat removed from the
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, I think that is not a bad way of putting it. I became impatient with
                    the tendency to look on foreign policy issues in academic, intellectual terms,
                    as opposed to immediate, operational, and pragmatic terms. This came up over and
                    over again. I took several different courses, including one with Dick Ullman, a
                    professor of political science who later spent a year writing editorials for the
                    “New York Times” and a year in the Pentagon in Washington. He was an interesting
                    and capable man. I became impatient with the tendency to look at foreign policy
                    issues as if you were in a laboratory, examining specimens. I felt that the
                    people in the academic world were removed from the real pressures and the real
                    world of diplomacy, the decisions that had to be made. At the same time, I felt
                    a sense of inadequacy in that I had been, perhaps, too inclined to work in a
                    “seat of the pants,” operational way and had not been looking long enough ahead
                    from a strategic or political perspective. So the experience was certainly good
                    for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a carry-over later on, so that
                        you could hark back and say, “Ah, ha.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I learned a good deal from the experience, and have since Princeton tried
                    to step back a bit from reacting too rapidly to events, to look at issues in a
                    longer perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research
                        in Washington, D. C.] from 1969 to 1971. You were the Director of Regional
                        African Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: INR at that time, and I guess still is, was divided like most of the
                    State Department into regional and functional offices. One office dealt with
                    African research and analysis. That was the office which I headed. It had
                    perhaps 15 people in it, though I think that it is smaller now. It was a time of
                    considerable interest. There was the overthrow of the monarchy in Libya. There
                    were rising tensions in Ethiopia — as the end of the regime approached there. It
                    was a time of the usual difficulties in Central Africa and also of the Biafra
                    secession in Nigeria. There were a lot of things going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take a couple of these at a time. What about Biafra?
                        This seemed to pit the State Department and its policy of opposing splitting
                        Africa up into clans or tribes against the Jewish community, most of the
                        Christian community, and other groups. All of the rock stars seemed to be on
                        the side of Biafra. It was a difficult policy...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HARROP: It was a very difficult policy and a very interesting problem. Careers
                    were made and broken in the U.S. Government over that issue. There was a sense
                    that, politically or in the national interest, we had to work with the central
                    government [of Nigeria] in its efforts to contain an insurgency, or else all of
                    Africa might fragment. The Biafrans were extremely competent in public
                    relations. They were very skillful at portraying themselves as being
                    ill-treated, as, in many respects, they were. One of the central government's
                    tactical approaches was to choke off food and fuel supplies. There was
                    starvation in Biafra. It was a tough, tough time. There was a lot of feeling and
                    sentiment in Washington over it, with the academic community largely favoring
                    the secession. We had great difficulties with the French, who kept slipping arms
                    to Colonel Ojukwu...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for the French? How did they look at
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The French, I think, have always tended to be contrary in Africa. They
                    have tended to take a position counter to the United Kingdom and, later, the
                    United States. Nigeria was the major, former British colony in Africa where the
                    British still had tremendous influence. I think it was a rather cynical
                    opportunity for the French to increase their stature in Nigeria, and to put down
                    the British.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems within INR and with the geographic
                        desk on our Biafra policy? I'm thinking of today, where we're having so much
                        trouble about [policy toward] the former Yugoslavia. We're having
                        resignations and so forth. It seems to me that this would be somewhat the
                        same situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were a number of people who were concerned on humanitarian grounds.
                    The pro-Biafra element in the United States was essentially a humanitarian
                    element. One of the leading figures was the Dean, at the time, of the Fletcher
                    School of Law and Diplomacy, Jean Mayer. He happened to be a physician and
                    nutritionist. That brought him strongly into the subject. He wrote a number of
                    articles on the suffering of the people in Biafra.</p>
                <p>In the State Department itself there was some division, but I would say there
                    were no major differences. There was a division between the Department and the
                    National Security Council, where there was a young Foreign Service Officer named
                    Roger Morris who left the Foreign Service over this question. He was a junior
                    officer on the National Security Council staff. He wrote a stream of strongly
                    critical pieces in an endeavor to turn policy around, going over the issues
                    repeatedly, dramatizing the suffering in Biafra, even though the administration
                    really had limited sympathy with his view point.</p>

                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HARROP: Very divided and very susceptible to influence from Colonel Ojukwu and
                    the Eastern Nigerians. A number of members of Congress can always be approached
                    successfully on human rights questions, and this happened on this occasion.
                    Members often seem open to allegations of heartlessness on the part of the U.S.
                    Government.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the reporting from Nigeria and the
                        neighboring posts on this issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, it was quite mixed, as a matter of fact, because we had an
                    ambassador there for a time, Bill Trueheart, who tended to have difficulty with
                    our policy. It was a difficult problem for Assistant Secretary David Newsom,
                    then in charge of the Bureau of African Affairs. There were more political,
                    analytical, and emotional divisions among the staff in the Embassy in Lagos than
                    in the State Department itself, it seemed to me. So we had of problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting reports in from the CIA? How well did you
                        feel that they were dealing with the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think they were doing pretty well. The CIA traditionally has prided
                    itself on not being distracted by matters of humanitarian concern when security
                    and national interest are believed at stake. I don't believe there was a
                    serious, internal problem within the Agency. They played a responsible role. The
                    main data was purely political reporting, and some economic reporting, in the
                    sense of military economics. It was not, I think, the kind of situation in which
                    the CIA could be expected to play a major role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you sketch a picture of INR at that time? This was
                        early in the Nixon administration. William Rogers was Secretary of State.
                        Henry Kissinger was beginning to develop his power. INR is somewhat removed
                        from the policy side, but did you feel the hand of Henry Kissinger at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, certainly. Ray Cline was the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence
                    and Research when I first arrived in INR. He was a former Deputy Director for
                    Intelligence at CIA and very familiar with the intelligence community. Kissinger
                    played a major role. I remember Cline complaining bitterly about his experience
                    with the morning briefings of the Secretary of State. William Rogers, who was
                    then Secretary had, in Cline's view, a distorted view of intelligence. I asked,
                    “What do you mean by that?” He said, “Well, he doesn't seem to think that
                    information is “intelligence” or is of value unless it has been obtained
                    covertly. When I go to brief him every morning, I try to give him a picture of
                    our best analysis of what's going on in the world of concern to the United
                    States. As always, four-fifths of that information is obtained by Embassy
                    reporting or from news services or overt reports from other governments. At the
                    very most one-fifth, and probably only one-tenth is obtained through covert,
                    intelligence channels. He [Rogers] seems uninterested in anything that wasn't
                    'purchased' from an agent or something of that kind.” It was very frustrating
                    for Cline, he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an aside, in the course of these interviews, I've been
                        struck by the pernicious development of our “buying” information. This kind
                        of information tends to be given greater weight, although, in many cases, it
                        should be given less weight. When you buy something, the old saying, “let
                        the buyer beware,” should apply. Within the foreign affairs community there
                        is a certain cachet or something like that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Historically it developed in that way, although I believe that there is a
                    more balanced view now. The fact is that you make foreign policy on the basis of
                    all available data and knowledge. Clearly, only a very minute portion of that is
                    going to be covert, secret intelligence. I agree with you that one should start
                    with “caveat emptor”.</p>

                        Haile Selassie there? I don't know how important Kagnew Station was at the

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Kagnew Station was still fairly important in the late 60's. I went out
                    there for a visit in 1970. The Eritrean insurgency was already active, and
                    Asmara was rather isolated from time to time. Kagnew was declining in resources
                    and in the value of its output. Kagnew and the intelligence station that we had
                    in Morocco, which I also visited at about the same time, were losing their
                    position on the scale of values back in Washington. Both were closed shortly
                    after on budget grounds.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Changes in communications in the world. But Kagnew was an immense
                    operation, I must say. It was a huge base.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the “Horn of Africa” area in INR in 1960-61, and
                        everything there in the Horn of Africa was related somehow to Kagnew
                        Station. Everything else was of lesser importance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It should have been clear at that time that Ethiopia was headed for
                    change and that the regime [of Haile Selassie] was on wobbly footing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the picture of Africa at the time, from your
                        perspective, what was the importance of Africa, particularly in terms of the
                        Cold War? Was it still a “zero sum” game — either the Soviets get their
                        people in or we get our people in? How did we look at Africa then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was still seen very much in Cold War terms. The “loss” of Libya, and
                    Wheelus Field there, were seen as a problem for the United States. There was
                    concern about the Leftist nature or avowed Marxist nature of some of the
                    independence groups in Eritrea — the ELF [Eritrean Liberation Front] and the
                    EPLF [Eritrean People's Liberation Front]. There was concern about the Soviet
                    role in Zaire, the Congo. There was always a worry because the Soviets had been
                    around in that part of the world for a long time. Africa was still seen in Cold
                    War terms, and the former colonial powers were relatively far more influential,
                    at the time, than they are now. They were much more active. The French and the
                    British, the Belgians — even the Italians — were still very active in that part
                    of the Horn of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression about Secretary of State
                        Rogers' concern about Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I don't think that he was much involved in Africa or worried about it
                    very much. He didn't tend to play a strong role. He was a passive Secretary of
                    State. I often felt that there was a kind of psychological weight upon him,
                    since the whole world felt he was dominated by the National Security Adviser
                    [Henry Kissinger]. He behaved as if that were the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As of that time — the 1969-1971 period — did you hear much
                        about Henry Kissinger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He began very early to be quite dominant, and there was a sense that the
                    State Department, even in the early days of the Nixon administration, was not
                    privy to much that was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little before you got into AFSA [American
                        Foreign Service Association]. We had the Cambodian invasion from Vietnam in
                        the spring of 1970. There was a sort of revolt of some junior officers on
                        this matter. Did you get involved in any of this Vietnam-type thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HARROP: I did not personally become involved in it, but many of my associates
                    did. For instance, a young man who was staff assistant to the Assistant
                    Secretary for Intelligence and Research, John Marks, resigned over the issue.
                    This was the time, I think, when Tony Lake, Dick Moose, Bill Watts and others
                    left the National Security Council staff. I recall very distinctly a letter
                    signed by 35 or 40 younger officers that was sent to the Secretary of State over
                    — was it the bombing of Haiphong or the invasion of Cambodia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that it was Cambodia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: This was a very critical letter. It was sent supposedly discreetly, but
                    it became public knowledge in time. I recall that Alexis Johnson, who was then
                    Under Secretary, and the senior FSO in government, had an interview with these
                    people and was very upset. He was convinced that the Department and the Foreign
                    Service would be seen in the White House as disloyal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the time when President Nixon said, “Fire them.”
                        I think that it was Alexis Johnson, with the cooperation of Secretary of
                        State Rogers who sort of “buried” the whole thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, he tried literally to “bury” Nixon's orders in his safe. It was a
                    time of great difficulty in the Department because there was very limited
                    sympathy among the younger generation for our Vietnam policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you became very much involved in personnel
                        matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, I'd been interested in them since the time when I'd worked in
                    Personnel in 1958-61. I'd been interested in the Foreign Service as an
                    institution and I became more interested when I was at Princeton, for some
                    reason. When you are in a different community, in a different institution, you
                    tend to think more about your own institution. I spent a long time reflecting on
                    the Foreign Service and what it meant, discussing it with people on the Faculty
                    and among the students at Princeton. I guess I must have written one or two
                    things about it at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I'd been back in Washington less than six months when I was called upon by Lannon
                    Walker, the outgoing Chairman of AFSA who had been a leader of the “Young Turk”
                    movement which had taken over AFSA in 1967. He was casting about desperately for
                    a successor. It's always the case with an organization such as the Foreign
                    Service Association. It has to be a self-perpetuating institution. The great
                    body of the Foreign Service is working as much as 15 hours a day on policy
                    matters and simply doesn't become “engaged” in AFSA as an institution. So people
                    who become involved are always looking for others to follow them.</p>
                <p>Lannon came to see me and said, “Why don't you become Chairman of AFSA?” This
                    possibility had never occurred to me. I thought it over for a bit and talked to
                    some other people. A friend of mine from boyhood days, Charles Bray, was also
                    involved with Lannon. So they persuaded me to join a slate to run for the board
                    of AFSA. I didn't run for chairman. Charlie Bray ran for chairman and I ran for
                    a position on the Board. It was not at all a secret maneuver on Charlie's part
                    to withdraw from the position of chairman. He had been working for AFSA as long
                    as Lannon Walker had, and was tired. That would leave me as Chairman, and that's
                    what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this full time as Chairman of AFSA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I began on a less than full time basis. Then, when I was elected Chairman
                    subsequently, I took “leave without pay” (LWOP) for a year, which was a bold
                    thing to do in some regards, since it reduced my annuity. The U.S. Government
                    would pay its contribution to an individual's annuity if that individual was on
                    leave without pay for six months. But after six months there was no way to
                    continue contributing to the annuity. Subsequent legislation changed that. So I
                    spent that year as Chairman of AFSA on LWOP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The year 1971 approximately, the calendar year of 1971. We had to find a
                    way to finance my salary. I made a trip to New York with Charlie Bray — a couple
                    of trips, in fact. We called on Douglas Dillon, who had a strong feeling for the
                    Foreign Service. He'd been Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. I remember
                    calling on him in that beautiful suite that he had at the top of the General
                    Motors Building on Fifth Avenue and 58th St., South of Central Park. We went in
                    and discussed the matter. What we needed to have was — I've forgotten the
                    amount. I guess my salary was probably around $35,000-40,000 a year. We needed
                    to have half of it in a taxable donation and half in a charitable contribution,
                    since we estimated that about half of the time would be spent on matters which
                    would be seen as charitable, under the tax laws, and half would not be. He said,
                    “Well, I'll give you all of the tax-free part and I'll give you half of the
                    other, but you've got to get the rest of it matched.”</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So we went around looking for other people and found them. It was useful to work
                    with a group called “The Public Members' Association.” I don't think that it
                    exists any more. Certainly, it was a great support to the Foreign Service. This
                    was a group of people who had served, as public members, on performance and
                    selection boards and on inspection teams. For a while we had a public member on
                    inspection teams. These people had a strong sense of affiliation to the
                    Department of State and the Foreign Service. We talked to them, and several of
                    them helped us financially, quite substantially. They subsequently helped with
                    other things that we were doing in AFSA. In that way I was able to collect the
                    money to pay my salary and was able to take a year of leave without pay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1971 what were the issues that you saw [in AFSA]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were several issues that I became involved in — not so much
                    professional questions, which interested me more at the outset, but in the
                    question of exclusive representation, labor-management relations, and,
                    subsequently, the grievance system of the Foreign Service. In a sense the whole
                    federal government was changing to a more classical labor-management
                    relationship with an elected, exclusive representative from among the employees,
                    agency by agency. The branch of the AFL/CIO for government affairs, the American
                    Federation of Government Employees, AFGE, was extremely active in
                    organizing.</p>
                <p>So the first challenge that we [in AFSA] had was to try to see that an executive
                    order was promulgated to cover the Foreign Service separate from the one that
                    would cover the entire government. We felt that the Foreign Service was a very
                    different institution from the Civil Service in such basic matters as the
                    concept of “rank in man,” rather than the “rank in position” concept, and in
                    overseas living. That was a hard, long, difficult struggle. I spent hours on
                    Capitol Hill, talking with Congressmen, and was invited to the White House and
                    elsewhere. We were finally successful. Then we participated in the drafting of
                    the executive order which would apply to the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thinking? Why was AFSA going after this, as
                        opposed to becoming a branch of AFGE, which would cover the Civil
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, the feeling was that the diplomatic service was, in fact, a
                    separate service, that the Rogers Act of 1924 and, later, the Foreign Service
                    Act of 1946 had been landmark pieces of legislation which created a personnel
                    system which was effective and useful and quite essential to the proper conduct
                    of diplomacy. The Foreign Service was composed of people who were world-wide
                    available, who carried their rank in themselves from place to place, who were
                    evaluated by other Foreign Service Officers, and which had the “up or out”
                    promotion concept. We felt that all of these things were essential to
                    maintaining a high quality system of international representation. We were
                    persuaded that we would lose those qualities if we came under the regular
                    executive order. Most particularly, if we were represented by the American
                    Federation of Government Employees, we would have been represented by an
                    organization of which, perhaps, 99.5% of the membership was from the Civil
                    Service and .05% from the Foreign Service. Since many of the issues, as we saw
                    them, were issues which separated the Foreign Service from the Civil Service, we
                    wanted to represent ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was nothing tougher and more professional than some
                        of the labor unions, particularly at that period. Here you were, a bunch of
                        neophytes to this business. How did you deal with AFGE on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, we were able to succeed because we knew our own institution better
                    than they did — much better than they did. We were more determined. The
                    representation of this tiny little number of Foreign Service personnel was more
                    important to us than it was to them. They had much larger fish to fry. We became
                    rather proficient at labor-management relations, to tell the truth. We worked
                    very hard at it and we became fairly skillful at managing these issues. I had
                    suits brought against me by individuals. I had to appear before the Labor
                    Relations Boards and in court. It was a very difficult business.</p>
                <p>Maybe I should tell this story, a rather strange one. A woman officer whom I'd
                    been associated with earlier on had been working in Vietnam. She was assigned to
                    a job in Washington which she didn't want. At the time I was then both Chairman
                    of AFSA and still Director of RAF [Office of Research for Regional African
                    Affairs] in INR. She wrote me and said, “I want to stay in political work. The
                    Department wants to put me in this management and personnel stuff. I don't want
                    to do that. Couldn't you find a position for me in INR?” I called up the
                    Personnel people and said that this officer wanted to work in INR and not where
                    you have her assigned which, I think, was to the Board of Examiners [of the
                    Foreign Service]. I asked, “What is the situation?” They said, “Well, if you
                    would like to have her there, it's not important that she go to the Board of
                    Examiners.” So she came to work with me in INR.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Then, eight or 10 months later, when we got into the thick of the troubles over
                    representation, she embraced AFGE — became an activist for AFGE, of which there
                    were several in the Department at the time. Then she filed a formal complaint
                    with the National Labor Relations Board against me. She claimed that I was not
                    qualified to head the American Foreign Service Association since I was, myself,
                    a management official and, therefore, was part of management and not part of the
                    body of employees. The evidence was that I had had the influence to change her
                    assignment. So I was brought before a board in the Department of Labor and had
                    to defend myself, successfully in the end with the pro bono help of an expert
                    Washington attorney.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall the period. There was an awful lot of heat within
                        the Foreign Service — correct me if I'm wrong — particularly among people
                        who felt that the Foreign Service “had done them wrong.” Didn't promote them
                        or something. You know, hell hath no fury than someone who hasn't been
                        promoted. Did you find that this group, which was really just mad at the
                        Foreign Service, was leading the AFGE stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was a very difficult time. An officer named John Hemenway had been
                    selected out of the Foreign Service. He brought a private lawsuit against me as
                    Chairman of AFSA, which I had to defend in court. He claimed that I had made it
                    more difficult for him to run for office in AFSA. There was a lot of ill feeling
                    and a lot of passion. Another officer who had been dropped from the Foreign
                    Service — I don't know whether he had been “selected out” or just failed to be
                    promoted — named John Harter also was very bitterly opposed to me, although
                    neither I nor AFSA had had anything to do with his career. These people felt
                    that the leadership of AFSA was itself a kind of establishment. In order to get
                    at the Foreign Service, they wanted to go with AFGE and really shake up or break
                    down the whole Foreign Service system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time I was a voting member but not involved in
                        this, looking at this whole question from the outside in — although I was a
                        Foreign Service Officer. Revenge seemed to be their prime motive — Luddites,
                        or whatever you want to call it. They were trying to destroy the
                        machinery.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes. We finally won the representation election, when it was held in the
                    Department of State, in USIA [United States Information Agency], and in AID
                    [Agency for International Development]. We lost two small units which went with
                    AFGE. One was a group in USIA who were only nominally in the Foreign Service,
                    and another group was the faculty at the Foreign Service Institute. But we won
                    that election [as a whole] and then endeavored to defend the interests of the
                    Foreign Service, vis-a-vis management, under the new rules. I had a long and, I
                    think, both honorable and confrontational relationship with Bill Macomber, who
                    at the time was Under Secretary for Management. We had considerable, mutual
                    respect, but we had some very hard words also.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Macomber had the reputation of having a very explosive
                        temper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little bit about dealing with
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He is a very human man but also, as you say, has an explosive temper. He
                    knows that. He worries about his own temper. I found that we could work
                    together. He had great respect for the Foreign Service, although not himself a
                    Foreign Service Officer. When I was able to demonstrate to him that the body of
                    the Foreign Service was behind our position, he would normally try to
                    accommodate himself to that. I remember F. Allen “Tex” Harris, a man who worked
                    with me for a time as Deputy Chairman [of AFSA]. He is himself now Chairman of
                    AFSA and has in turn gone on leave without pay. Tex Harris is a man about 6'4”
                    in height and must weigh about 260 pounds. He is a big, friendly, bluff Texan
                    and also a lawyer. He is persuasive, forceful, gregarious, and effective. I
                    remember that I once telephoned Bill Macomber concerning some issue that meant a
                    lot to us. I said, “Look, we really care about this, and I hope you can find a
                    way to go along with our point of view.” Macomber said, “Damn it, if you'll
                    promise not to send Harris over here again, I'll do it.”</p>
                <p>A second phase of all these problems came with the grievance situation, since the
                    Department of State and the Foreign Service had never had an objective
                    grievance/appeal system. There was great concern and anxiety over it. Alexis
                    Johnson, for instance, felt very strongly that “Papa knew best,” that the senior
                    people had to decide these things, and that those affected shouldn't be able to
                    appeal to objective, third parties. He felt that such matters should be taken
                    care of inside the Foreign Service. We had a very difficult time with this
                    matter. About that time an officer that had been “selected out” committed
                    suicide, a man named Thomas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Charles Thomas. There were two Charles Thomas's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Thomas' wife was embittered. She became very active politically, drumming
                    up Congressional support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her name was Cynthia Thomas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HARROP: Cynthia Thomas. She is quite a capable woman, actually. It was clear that
                    we had to have some kind of objective grievance system in the Foreign Service.
                    Yet we wanted to have it in such a way that it would not destroy the fabric of
                    the Foreign Service. We were able to get a program through, and subsequently
                    into legislation, which, I think, did that. But it was a difficult and divisive
                    issue. On one occasion I sent a circular cable out to ambassadors throughout the
                    world which asked, “Will you support us on this?” We had an overwhelming flow of
                    support from the ambassadors. It was heartwarming, really. That, I think, broke
                    the Department's opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the feeling that, starting with Lannon Walker and
                        then continuing with you and Tom Boyatt, this process involved a
                        generational change. The older generation, represented by U. Alexis Johnson
                        and others, although they themselves might not have come from money, thought
                        that [when you encountered problems], you gritted your teeth and hoped that
                        your family would support you. This was more than a job. It was a calling.
                        For those of us who came in after World War II [service in the Department of
                        State] was a profession, but we had wives and children whom we had to worry
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that the Foreign Service, the traditional Foreign Service, had
                    become somewhat out of phase with social evolution in America. There is more of
                    a problem now than there was then. We are in difficulty in the Foreign Service,
                    because of Americans' insistence today upon individual rights — the individual
                    against the institution — and the reluctance to commit oneself to a life-long
                    calling, as most of us did 30-50 years ago. That commitment no longer is the
                    case. My own son is a very capable young officer who is now on his third tour,
                    currently in Washington. I don't know whether he's going to go abroad again or
                    not. His wife and he are both lawyers. They don't feel that sense of commitment.
                    It never occurred to me that I wouldn't go abroad again or wouldn't stay in the
                    Foreign Service. They're looking [at this situation] every day, asking
                    themselves, “What's our best bet? Should we stay here or should we go?” I think
                    this is true of virtually all of the younger people now. I believe that the
                    Service loses a great deal when its members no longer have that sense of
                    long-term commitment to an institution despite the fact that it's been even more
                    buffeted than the Department of State, the Central Intelligence Agency seems to
                    have been more successful than the Foreign Service in retaining that sense of
                    cohesion and coherence.</p>
                <p>The other day I went to the funeral of a fellow who'd been my Chief of Station at
                    one post and saw many CIA people who had been his friend — people who included
                    senior officers and those at all levels. That reconfirmed in my mind the feeling
                    sense that they still retained more of that sense of being part of an
                    institution, working together in a single direction, than the Foreign Service
                    does. I guess it's not surprising, since they work under certain pressures which
                    round them together against the rest of the world. They have to have secrecy,
                    and their lives must be conducted in a very unusual and special way which they
                    share among themselves. This would tend to prolong the sense of institution.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A minor digression. In a way what we're doing here right
                        now is part of a very modest effort in one direction of trying to pass on to
                        the next generation what people do. I think that the Foreign Service and the
                        Department of State have been terribly remiss. They have done virtually
                        nothing to draw attention to the fact that they recruit an elite. However,
                        they don't do much about telling this elite why they're special and what
                        they've accomplished.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that's true. But it's been possible to maintain this quality, and
                    I think it's been fascinating that, despite all of the problems, social
                    introspection, and difficulties over the past 20 to 30 years, the quality of the
                    recruits that we are bringing in remains very, very high. I've served with young
                    officers at every post and I'm struck by the fact that this quality stays
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other, major things that you were dealing
                        with in AFSA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Sure. On the professional side we were working hard to bring the Foreign
                    Service more into American public life and to establish a constituency
                    interested in foreign affairs and in the welfare of the Foreign Service. AFSA's
                    worked on this for a long time. I guess it began, really, with the “Young Turk”
                    group in the late 1960's. [We have tried] to get more Foreign Service Officers
                    out, speaking to public groups, attending meetings with members of Congress,
                    business people, and academic people — trying to get the rest of the country to
                    understand the role of the Foreign Service better and trying to make the Foreign
                    Service more open to influences from the rest of the country, trying to fend off
                    the risk of insularity. This is always a risk when you have an institution with
                    its own strong culture, with a sense of elite-ness.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've often heard complaints that the Foreign Service
                        really didn't understand the importance of working with Congress to develop
                        a constituency...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, it's a common criticism, and essentially probably true. The role of
                    Congress was nowhere near the same, 30 years ago. There's been a secular
                    increase in the day to day involvement of Congress as a whole — Congressional
                    committees and individual Congressmen — in foreign policy issues. This really
                    was not the case when I entered the Foreign Service. I remember very well — and
                    this is a sharp contrast — that in the 1950's and 1960's it was regarded as not
                    only improper but possibly illegal for foreign diplomats assigned to Washington
                    — ambassadors and others — to deal directly with Congress. One even heard talk
                    about taking action against them, if they dealt with the Congress. They should
                    work with the executive branch. The Constitution made that clear. Now it is a
                    very common phenomenon for foreign diplomats to work with Senators and
                    Representatives. I've heard Secretaries of State say to ambassadors, “Well, you
                    really should talk to Senator So-and-So about that because he doesn't understand
                    your point of view. Go and have a talk with this or that committee.” So we've
                    come full circle on that subject. The Congress has become much more intimately
                    involved in foreign policy — I think with both good and ill effect. There are
                    some very real problems in the efforts of Congress to make individual, “fine
                    tuning” decisions, to allocate funds, or to earmark AID money, which is the most
                    evident aspect. But it's not just that. It involves a hundred, different
                    directions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back [to the Department of State] in

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, one of the issues which we had at that time was the role of women.
                    We were energetic, working with NOW [National Organization of Women]. We had
                    some active women on our board [of directors]. I tried to promote the role of
                    women in the Foreign Service and to achieve greater equality — I think, with
                    some success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Alison Palmer active at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Alison Palmer was very active at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about how she worked or did not
                        work with AFSA, because she was a very controversial figure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>HARROP: She was a difficult person for me to communicate with. Alison Palmer is
                    the woman I was referring to who brought suit against me for helping her to
                    change her assignment in Washington. I didn't mention her name before. She could
                    be difficult — I would say even vicious. She had become completely embittered
                    about the role of women in American society, and particularly in the Foreign
                    Service. She seemed cynical, almost iconoclastic, and carried through that way.
                    She was an intelligent and capable officer but was just totally soured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is one of the things I know of, particularly in
                        personnel matters. One can't help thinking of three names: Alison Palmer,
                        John Hemenway, and John Harter. Iconoclastic is probably the best term to
                        use for their attitude. They weren't really looking for a solution [to
                        problems] but were almost [trying] to destroy, out of a feeling almost of
                        vengeance. I get this feeling...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: They were very, very bitter. In fact, some five years later, when I was
                    first nominated to be an ambassador, they came to testify against me before the
                    [Senate] Foreign Relations Committee, and then pursued me in subsequent
                    nominations in a hostile and provocative way. It's very sad, but I suppose it
                    could be said, that there are people such as these who were destroyed by their
                    experience in the Foreign Service. You would have to go carefully into the whole
                    history [of this matter] to understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about AFSA when you left it in 1971?
                        Where was it going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I was concerned that it would be difficult, as it had been for the NEA
                    (National Education Association), which had tried the same thing that we had: to
                    be both a professional association and a union. In the case of the NEA, they
                    appeared to drop the aspect of a professional association and became an outright
                    union. There's kind of a Gresham's Law, if that's the right term, that applies
                    here. The union issues tend to push out the professional issues. But that, in
                    fact, has not entirely occurred with AFSA, which is still much involved in
                    professional matters and is still doing many things of a responsible,
                    professional nature. So I'm pleased that up to now AFSA has been able to combine
                    the two. I left AFSA with a strong, positive feeling for the Foreign Service and
                    a positive feeling for AFSA itself, as well as with deep concern that only about
                    10% of the Foreign Service really cared about the institution enough to find
                    time to do something about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I don't know how many times I've talked to colleagues, some of them the
                    best-known “names” in the contemporary Foreign Service, including chiefs of
                    mission and assistant secretaries about the Foreign Service. To my astonishment
                    I have often found that they don't know even the basic elements of their own
                    personnel system — even things that affect them personally such as their own
                    annuity situation, their allowances, what will happen to their spouse and
                    children after they die. They simply aren't concerned. They are focused
                    exclusively on national interest, policy questions, foreign policy. So there is
                    a very small group that tries to defend AFSA and the Foreign Service as an
                    institution. But you can get those other people, the very silent majority, to
                    rally around, as I learned from experience, when you have some major issue. You
                    can appeal to them in terms of the Foreign Service, and they will usually come
                    through. They just don't spend time on it and they're not involved on a day to
                    day basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did your job in policy planning come about and
                        what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I guess it came about in part because I had become fairly prominent as
                    the Chairman of AFSA during this turbulent period. I'd just been promoted to
                    FSO-2, which was fairly senior in the Foreign Service, now the rank of
                    counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the equivalent of a brigadier or major
                        general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Brigadier general, I guess. Our military friends hate to admit that
                    analogy. I was still Chairman of the American Foreign Service Association, but I
                    was going to return to my career from leave without pay. I was concerned about
                    where I would go that would not be a clearly managerial position, so that I
                    could still represent the Association. Assignment to the Policy Planning staff
                    seemed to be a good compromise. This was suggested, and that was what I did.
                    Arthur Hartman was then the head of the Policy Planning Council. I'd known him —
                    I'd replaced him once before in the European Bureau. We were friends, and so I
                    joined that organization and worked, as a matter of fact, more on management
                    issues than on policy issues; the Policy Planning Council at that time was going
                    through a period of experimentation. It was called the Planning and Coordination
                    Staff. I was working on the coordination side, which was the managerial
                    side.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I found it very interesting and became involved right away in a major issue which
                    I followed both as Chairman of AFSA and as an officer on the Policy Planning
                    Council. We'd gone through several repeat performances of the Department of
                    Commerce's seeking alliances in the American business community to strip away
                    the economic and commercial aspects of overseas representation from the Foreign
                    Service and the Department of State. Another one of these efforts came up at
                    that time in the form of a bill introduced by Senator Warren Magnuson of
                    Washington, who was then Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Magnuson
                    bill would have simply stripped most economic responsibilities out of the
                    Department of State and put them in the Department of Commerce. I regarded that
                    as a tremendously undesirable development for the country as well as the Foreign
                    Service. I worked hard to defeat this bill, both on Capitol Hill and inside the
                    executive branch. John Irwin was then Deputy Secretary of State. I worked very
                    closely with him on the subject. And we succeeded. We defeated the proposal.</p>
                <p>However, it came back again. The Foreign Service always has a short memory for
                    bureaucratic issues. Without very many people willing to spend the time which I
                    had spent on this subject, it came up again six or seven years later — and, 10
                    years later, passed into law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least the commercial side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, only the commercial side, although the office of the Special Trade
                    Representative was soon to be established with responsibility over trade
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from a feeling of just plain “turf,” why would it
                        have been a good thing to have both the commercial and economic aspect in
                        the Department of State, as opposed to Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HARROP: Because, on the one hand, those areas are so intimately part of foreign
                    policy. You would further divide the management of foreign policy if you had
                    other cabinet secretaries or ministers of government formally running parts of
                    foreign policy. Secondly, in fact, ambassadors and Foreign Service Officers are
                    really more effective than people from the Department of Commerce in defending
                    the interests of American business and American exports. This has been
                    demonstrated frequently. I worried very much that one of the reasons that the
                    whole issue came up and nearly succeeded at that time — and did succeed later —
                    was that Foreign Service officers were often “blind” to the importance of these
                    matters. Foreign Service Officers tended to focus on political and otherwise
                    defined economic issues and not to put their backs into export promotion and the
                    support of American business interests. This was costly for the entire country,
                    as well as for the Foreign Service itself. I felt we might correct this
                    psychology in the course of opposing Magnuson”s proposal. In the process, we
                    changed the name of the Bureau of Economic Affairs to the Bureau of Economic and
                    Business Affairs, and did a number of things to raise the importance of business
                    support. We were trying to bring about a cultural change and, in that sense,
                    ultimately failed. The Foreign Service did not then really grasp the fact that
                    export promotion was a major part of its responsibilities, did not put itself
                    into it, and lost this function. The failure of the Department of Commerce to
                    handle this function effectively since then is clear enough. I don't know
                    whether [this function] will ever come back [to the Department of State], but in
                    any case the interest of American exporters and investors are still not
                    effectively defended by Ambassadors and FSOs, and U.S. companies look to the
                    Ambassador for support.</p>
                <p>One of the themes of the whole AFSA “movement” is that there should be unity in
                    foreign policy efforts, that there should be central direction, and a central
                    personnel system with, perhaps, branches in agriculture, commerce, and
                    elsewhere, a single “Foreign Service of the United States.” There should be a
                    coherence to foreign policy management in a world which is more and more
                    fractioned and split up vertically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've always had the impression, never having worked with
                        it particularly, that the Department of Commerce has traditionally been a
                        very “weak” Department and poorly managed. This would obviously reflect on
                        its “clout” and its ability to deliver.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think Mr. [Ron] Brown, our new Secretary [of Commerce], is having a
                    disillusioning experience. He is a man of tremendous energy and ambition. I
                    suspect that he's found that he doesn't have an effective instrument to
                    deploy.</p>
                <p>Another cause that we worked on at that time in the Policy Planning Council, and
                    which I've expended much energy over the years, particularly as Inspector
                    General, was “management by objectives.” This is the effort to do
                    institutionalize planning and programing into the management of foreign
                    affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what “planning by objectives” is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The notion of designing your purposes ahead, over a period of time —
                    whatever the schedule is you wish to use, normally a year, with longer periods
                    beyond that. Then, on a “rolling” basis, review how you are going to attain your
                    objective, setting out, as concretely as possible, the steps that will be
                    necessary to realize the purposes that you want to achieve. This tool is used in
                    virtually all successful enterprises outside of foreign policy. There has always
                    been monumental resistance to it in the Foreign Service. There is a preference
                    for doing things “by the seat of the pants”. Officers will say, “Well, how can I
                    tell whether they're going to devalue the currency?”, or “How can I tell if
                    they're going to invade their neighbor?” If you aren't careful, you find that
                    your foreign policy is a policy of reaction to others' actions, instead of
                    thinking through where you want to go and where you are going to allocate your
                    resources in order to influence people and events.</p>
                <p>It's a continuing struggle. We've made a good deal of progress on it. Foreign
                    policy is not a perfect world. [Your objectives] cannot be fully realized, and,
                    in fact, you can't predict when one country is going to invade its neighbor or
                    devalue its currency. But if you know where you're going and you've set yourself
                    up to pursue defined objectives, you can do much better. We're doing better.</p>

                        side, would seem to be running counter to what was the great engine of the
                        Nixon administration, the National Security Council. Did you feel that you
                        were being undercut or shoved aside...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: You mean, to the extent that the National Security Council itself was
                    trying to play the role of the Department of State? Sure. That was a big
                    problem. Actually, Arthur Hartman had already become a favorite of Henry
                    Kissinger at that time, and that was a help, from the Policy Planning Council's
                    point of view. But it was a real problem. That sense of working in an
                    institution, which was challenged, and challenged successfully on a daily basis,
                    by a small team in the White House, was a disillusioning matter in the
                    Department of State. People say from year to year, “Morale has never been lower
                    in the Department of State.” Such comments seem always in fashion. However, that
                    particular era — of Kissinger and Rogers — really was especially difficult.</p>

                        the Policy Planning Council staff, what were some of the prime issues that
                        we were concerned about which the policy planners were looking at? This was
                        the 1972-73 period.</hi>

                <p>HARROP: The Middle East was always [a matter for concern]. The Rogers' Plan was
                    the current program for attacking Arab-Israeli issues. There was great concern
                    about the future of the developing world and the American relationship to it.
                    The evolution of Europe was a heavy topic, and we were kind of “regrouping,”
                    because in the early 1960's there had been a sense of exhilaration over the
                    integration of Europe and [the prospect of] a really valid partner abroad. We
                    could set the risk of war aside in Europe by helping [the European countries] to
                    bind themselves together and develop a more effective political and economic
                    structure. There was a certain disillusionment in that connection as the
                    problems came up, as De Gaulle and the British, in an odd alliance, set that
                    whole movement back. That was a matter of focus to policy planners. We were
                    still involved in the Vietnam War, another matter of daily concern. And always
                    the Soviets and the strategic competition.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, that was an issue on which a lot of time was spent in the Department
                    — and to some good effect. There was concern and interest. There was a naive
                    feeling of exhilaration in the country that China had more or less replaced
                    Europe as the center of America's future. Ten years later, taking part in an
                    inspection of Foreign Service posts in China, I saw the way in which American
                    companies had “jumped” at the chance to go into China and then had proved unable
                    to master the bureaucratic and culture impediments to doing business there. This
                    phenomenon has been repeated, I hope with more care, in Eastern Europe since the
                    downfall [of communism] there.</p>

                <p>HARROP: The Soviet Union was viewed, and very strongly, as a contestant and
                    opponent. We were in a bipolar world and we could not let down our guard.
                    Maintaining our defenses and defense appropriations and looking at foreign

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Marshall Green was Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and a most
                    distinguished Foreign Service Officer. He had been Ambassador to Indonesia and
                    Charg� d'Affaires in South Korea and had held various other positions in Asia.
                    He simply did not “get on” with President Nixon. He didn't really approve of the
                    policy in Vietnam, although he loyally carried it out. From a personality point
                    of view they didn't mesh. Nixon is a very serious man, I would say, without much
                    sense of humor. Marshall Green tends to be — not flippant, but witty, a clever,
                    a quipster, a punster. He is able to look at things in a light way, and makes
                    jokes about issues when tension rises. I understand that Nixon just hated
                    Marshall Green's puns — couldn't stand them. So whether for policy or personal
                    incompatibility Marshall was going to have to move. He was named Ambassador to
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>He had to choose a DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission]. Although I was only an
                    acquaintance he chose me to be his DCM. He called me down to talk to him, and
                    off we went. Well, I'd been replaced as Chairman of AFSA and I was at the end of
                    a normal tour in the Department of State. I was flattered that Marshall Green
                    would ask for me. So I accepted the proposal and had a perfectly fascinating two
                    years in Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1973 to 1975?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Marshall Green use you as DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Marshall Green taught me how to use a DCM. By happenstance, we arrived
                    the same month in Canberra. The previous Ambassador, [who was] a former chairman
                    of Reynolds Aluminum [a businessman], left just after I arrived, and Marshall
                    came in three or four days later. We were both new to Australia, although he had
                    a long, long contact and experience with Asia, where I had never worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>We had a Country Team meeting the day Marshall Green arrived. He and I were there
                    at the head of the table of 15 people — it was a large mission. He went around
                    the table, saying, “I'd appreciate it if each of you would introduce yourself
                    and outline some of the main issues that are facing us in your area of concern.”
                    After he did that, the Defense Attach� spoke about our defense facilities in
                    Australia, and the fact that under the new Labor Government they were under
                    public scrutiny and pressure. Ambassador Green turned to me and said, “What do
                    you think, Bill?” I said, “Well, I don't know. Let's look at that further.” I
                    knew nothing about the subject at all. Somebody else described another sector,
                    and the Ambassador said, “What do you think, Bill?” I finally figured out that
                    he was systematically trying to build me up to the group there, showing them
                    that my views were important to him and that they'd better listen to me as well
                    as to him. It worked and I was off to a strong start. I've since done the same
                    thing myself as Ambassador five times. It is an effective technique and builds a
                    strong leadership team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues that you were involved in in
                        Australia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I arrived in Australia shortly after the new, Labor Government came into
                    office. There'd been a conservative government — Liberal, as it's called there —
                    in office for 21 years, under Prime Ministers Menzies, Holt, and others. So for
                    the first time the Left came into power. They were just itching to get at it and
                    to reverse all of the “criminal, reactionary policies” that had been followed
                    the previous 21 years. They pulled their forces out of Vietnam in a matter of
                    days. They brought to the top of their agenda the three major American defense
                    facilities in Australia, which were highly classified but which people knew
                    vaguely to have some relationship to space or to atomic energy or
                    communications. They whipped up public opposition to these facilities. There
                    were marches on two of them. One was near Alice Springs or Pine Gap, as it was
                    called. Another was at Woomera, in South Australia, and the third was at
                    Northwest Cape in western Australia, a naval communications facility north of
                    Perth.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere was actually quite tense. The government was very critical of the
                    United States. It seemed determined to demonstrate, on a daily basis, that
                    Australia was no longer a “satrap” of America. It established relations with
                    China right away, sent an ambassador there; other such steps were taken very,
                    very quickly. So we Americans felt a certain amount of pressure. It was an
                    interesting and exciting time to be in Australia. We had about $5.0 billion in
                    American investment there, but the country was in economic difficulty, partly
                    through mismanagement. It was a time of particular political excitement and
                    confrontation because of the policies of the new Australian government. Gough
                    Whitlam was the new, activist Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, when you were dealing with the Australians —
                        was this sort of a reflection of the British labor movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, some of the extremes in Australia were a reflection of the British
                    labor movement, because Australian labor had been very much “tutored” by their
                    British counter parts. I'd never been in a society so persecuted by strikes, by
                    industrial action, as Australia. I don't think that there was ever a day in
                    which some group was not on strike — if not the airline pilots, it would be the
                    mailmen or the bakers or the autoworkers or the engineers, the health workers or
                    the teachers. The society was crippling itself. A pervasive self-conscious
                    radicalism which had been kept under wraps for a long, long time had burst free.
                    Even stronger than the opposition to American leadership, was the outright
                    hostility to the [British] Crown and to London and toward even being a member of
                    the [British] Commonwealth. We had to be careful not to appear to be in alliance
                    with the conservative elements in Australian society. People from the older
                    generation would come to us and say, “You understand that we don't agree with
                    any of this radical nonsense. You Americans are our friends. We remember how you
                    saved us during World War II. We remember the Battle of the Coral Sea. We are
                    your allies, and don't you worry.” And the [Australian] Ministry of Defense and
                    the armed forces and the intelligence community maintained the firmest possible
                    links with their American counterparts, as a kind of bastion against their own
                    government. The period 1973 to 1975 in Australia was quite something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Labor government people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: [Prime Minister] Gough Whitlam was a man of parts. I found him
                    fascinating, a joy to work with. Intellectually, he was quick and sharp
                    personally, charming and decisive. A little volatile at times, but a man of
                    great energy. Ambassador Green was very skillful in getting to know the Prime
                    Minister, learning how best to work with him, to earn his trust.</p>
                <p>Some of Whitlam's cabinet ministers were incorrigibly hostile to America, men
                    like Jim Cairns. They were real Labor radicals. They disliked the United States
                    and made that fact very clear. I recall that I had difficulty being received by
                    one of these ministers, a man named Cameron, at one time when the Ambassador was
                    away and I was Charg� d'Affaires. He didn't want even to see the American
                    charg�. However, by working through the Prime Minister we could find more
                    balance. We sought to operate as much as possible through the Ministry of
                    Defense and the foreign affairs and intelligence establishment (without
                    undermining their position). These groups retained an intuitive pro-Western
                    stance and were embarrassed by the excesses of their own government. And the
                    public at large retained a spirit of English-speaking unity. We had not yet
                    reached the point when the dominant generation had no experience of World War
                    II. So it was possible to manage a difficult relationship.</p>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HARROP: No. It was a critical time at home as well. I was charg� at the moment of
                    Nixon's resignation, and the United States was descending into the Watergate
                    affair while we were there. That was a really tough problem to manage anywhere
                    overseas.</p>

                        understand what it was all about. I think that most Europeans had a very
                        hard time because Nixon hadn't done anything that any self-respecting
                        European political leader hadn't done, and in spades, a number of times. How
                        did the Australians react to Watergate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was mixed. Some Australians felt that all is fair in love and
                    politics. They just found the way the American nation turned against its
                    President on moral and ethical grounds incomprehensible. But there's a tradition
                    of honor in British politics, which Australians very much reflect, a sense of
                    lines one must not cross. So there was some understanding. I think that there
                    was a very real worry about the implications for Australia, the sort of worry
                    found around the world. The United States was the greatest power on earth, and
                    we were still in the middle of a tremendous bipolar confrontation with
                    communism. People were looking at America's troubles in introspective terms.
                    They were very worried. Was the United States going to falter now as the leader,
                    and what was going to happen? There were many discussions of that sort.</p>
                <p>The Australian press is a brawling, robust institution. Rupert Murdoch is from
                    Australia. There were speculative reports coming out all the time about the
                    Watergate affair. It was just a very emotional time there, as it was everywhere
                    else.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our withdrawal — in disarray is probably a mild

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There you also have the different political segments of the country. It
                    was a matter of great worry and anxiety to the conservative elements, to the
                    defense and intelligence community, and to the pro-British, pro-Commonwealth,
                    Western conservative and traditionalist groups. It was really welcomed by the
                    Left and by the Australian government itself. I don't think that they were
                    cynical or bitter, in the sense that they wanted to see the United States
                    humbled in that way, but they did welcome our departure from Vietnam. They felt
                    our policy had been badly mistaken, and it was best that we get out. I must say
                    that the Australian government was dallying a bit with North Vietnam during part
                    of that period.</p>

                <p>HARROP: Yes, but views were mixed. There was a sense of the need to address the
                    social ills of Australia. Labor was in power with a feeling that they had much
                    more important issues in health, education, and employment than they did in
                    Vietnam or anywhere else overseas. They tended to shrink their defense budget
                    below what we thought prudent. They were faced with a political quandary. How
                    could they insult the United States and shrink their defense budget and yet
                    still continue to depend upon the United States for their global defense? That
                    was a theme that you heard often. The defense and intelligence community were
                    very concerned about Australia's security under the new Labor Government. They
                    leaned over backward to cooperate with and fully support their counterparts in
                    Washington — and in the Embassy, too.</p>
                <p>There was an interesting dichotomy. In fact, there was some question for a time,
                    I felt, about the loyalty of the defense and intelligence community — the
                    establishment in Australia, which has always been a strong body — to its own
                    government. They had a profound disagreement with what they felt were the
                    dangerously lax and radical policies of their government, and its failure to
                    appreciate the continuing threat of communism.</p>
                <p>Always another issue there was immigration from Asia. Australians were
                    chronically concerned about immigration. In addition to the perceived “yellow
                    peril” they were having difficulties with Yugoslav and Croatian immigrants.
                    There was considerable terrorism, strangely enough, in Australia, caused by and
                    among Yugoslav newcomers, who were a fairly substantial community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Indonesia? What were Australian views
                        concerning that country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was and probably always will be a preoccupation for Australia, which
                    is more sensitive to Indonesia, in some ways, than to China. Papua New Guinea
                    was not yet independent. It was still an Australian trusteeship under the United
                    Nations. That was a great concern. The Left in Australian politics was very
                    exercised about East Timor and about Indonesian repression of the population
                    there.</p>
                <p>Australia is a very interesting country — quite unique, very different, I think,
                    from other political systems. There is something unformed about Australia. It's
                    a country without a long history, without a past. An industrialized, developed
                    country without a history. There actually is, to a surprising extent, a
                    conscious, individual awareness of the convict background. People blush at the
                    notion that their ancestors might have been convicts. It's a peculiar society,
                    but highly attractive.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HARROP: New Zealand was part of the ANZUS [Australia, New Zealand, and the United
                    States] Alliance. I did not, myself, sense foreshadowing of their later turn on
                    the nuclear issue. There were always elements in both Australia and New Zealand
                    which were concerned about ship visits and about nuclear questions. That was
                    always a question, always an issue. Nuclear ship visits and nuclear weapons. You
                    see the great concern was that the secret American defense bases would, in some
                    fashion, attract nuclear retaliation upon Australia. That was the political
                    framework in which hostility to the American presence was expressed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes. I was on home leave after less than two years in Australia and was
                    telephoned by the then Director General [of the Foreign Service], Nathaniel
                    Davis. Actually, we were out skiing. We'd had a visit to Australia from former
                    Deputy Secretary John Irwin. While he was there, he had dinner at our house.
                    When I mentioned that on our home leave we were thinking about skiing. he said,
                    “Well, why don't you use our place?” It turned out that he had a lovely, big
                    apartment in a new ski area called Snow Bird outside of Salt Lake City. So we
                    did. While we were in John Irwin's apartment, I received the telephone call from
                    Nat Davis, asking if I'd like to be Ambassador to Guinea. Our sons have joked
                    about it ever since. They heard me say, on the phone, “I'd be honored.” They
                    said, “What was that, Pop?” I said, “He's asked me to be Ambassador to Guinea.”
                    And everybody laughed and said, “He'd be honored to be Ambassador to Guinea.” So
                    that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went back to Washington, what was the situation
                        in Guinea and what were our concerns there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was a tense time. Sekou Toure had been in office, I guess, for about
                    12-14 years. He was the leader of the radical, Pan-Africanist movement of
                    hostility toward the Western world, particularly France. He was defiantly and
                    determinedly trying to implement socialism in Guinea, now a poverty-stricken
                    country which had been relatively prosperous. Guinea possesses about one-third
                    of the world's supply of bauxite, as well as marvelous iron ore resources, water
                    power, good soil, waterfalls useful for generating hydroelectric power,
                    diamonds. But the economy had been virtually destroyed by this socialist regime.
                    The Soviets had a strong position in Guinea. I remember that they had a mission
                    of 1200 people in that small African nation. The Chinese had about 700
                    people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We had 16 people.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems as though the socialist idea — I'm trying to use
                        the term in the normal definition of government as meaning control over most
                        matters — has really had a pernicious effect in much of the world. We're
                        recovering from it now. Why did it take root in Africa so much and why was
                        it so destructive at that time? Do you have any thoughts on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that it took root in Africa because communism or “African
                    socialism,” in fact, is the most effective tool for a determined leader to use
                    to take charge of a society. I think that that's the real purpose of it. There
                    was also a revolt against the capitalism of the former colonial powers — a
                    desire to get away from that and change things altogether, as well as an honest
                    idealism based on concern for the “common man.” But actually I believe such
                    idealism was manipulated as a weapon in the hands of a determined, forceful
                    leader.</p>
                <p>Sekou Toure was a very ruthless authoritarian, but a man who had a certain amount
                    of personal charm — as is so often the case. He was one of these people who
                    would work all through the night. I encountered another in Siad Barre in Somalia
                    some years later. Sekou Toure would offer me a meeting very late at night. Or
                    I'd go to see him at his request at 6:00 AM and find that he hadn't been to bed
                    yet. He was just a dominant figure, trying to regiment the society. [Guinea] was
                    called “the party state.” It was organized in party terms. The governmental
                    institutions were really manifestations of the party, so that a person's role in
                    the party was that person's prominent, primary credential. After that the
                    individual was given certain jobs as a mayor, governor, or something else. Every
                    citizen was perforce a member of the party. Sekou Toure insisted on certain
                    dress codes. He enforced a regimentation of society beyond anything that you
                    could imagine. He banned any private, commercial activity. Most people who have
                    seen Africa think of it as shopkeepers, markets, women with piles of grains and
                    nuts in front of them. That wasn't permitted in Guinea. There were no shops —
                    there just was no commercial activity in Conakry or in Guinea generally. It was
                    an unspeakably sad country.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The tremendous presence of the Soviets was an interesting challenge, as far as I
                    was concerned. In fact one of the things that we encountered right away was the
                    use of the Guinean airport, which had been built for them by the Soviets, for
                    surveillance flights over the [U.S.] Atlantic Fleet. Large Soviet “Bear”
                    aircraft, the Tupolev transport, would operate from three airports. One was
                    Conakry, another was Havana, and the third was Angola, out of Luanda. They would
                    patrol the Atlantic Ocean and overfly NATO shipping. I set out to try to reverse
                    this disagreeable and potentially dangerous situation, and finally succeeded in
                    doing so by exerting continuing pressure on Sekou Toure, appealing to any sense
                    of fair play that he might have. He always had great respect for [President]
                    Kennedy and a high regard for the United States, as a matter of fact, despite
                    his determination to establish a socialist system. He was totally dependent on
                    us for PL [Public Law] 480 food supplies, because the productive capacity of his
                    rich, agricultural country had been totally undermined. Since there was no
                    profit involved in producing food, people just didn't do it.</p>
                <p>In the end, and with some objections to it back in Washington, I rather equally
                    ruthlessly used our PL 480, Title I relationship with Guinea to force him to
                    close the airport to the Soviets — and succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about this policy a bit. Here we were selling
                        food [to Guinea] for local currency, which was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Guinea was what was called an “excess currency country,” along with India
                    and its rupees. The [Guinean] currency was called the “Syli”. We had billions of
                    Sylis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, that element in the United States which felt strongly about
                    starvation in Biafra felt the same way about starvation in Guinea. There is that
                    strong feeling that humanitarian assistance should not be affected by political
                    considerations. I was exposed to a recent manifestation of this in Israel, when
                    our support of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union was [regarded] as
                    a humanitarian “duty” of the United States and should not be mixed with the
                    construction of settlements [in the Occupied Territories] or with other
                    political issues. It's the same kind of argument. It was seen as cynical or
                    cold-blooded to use food as a weapon for political purposes.</p>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HARROP: They tried to do this for a short time but were not really [able to do
                    so]. They were over-extended in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outside of these overflights, what were the Soviets and
                        the Chinese hoping to get out of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I guess it was a foothold, a reflection of their rivalry with the United
                    States, maybe a dream that they could turn Africa “red.” I don't know.
                    Certainly, there was a rational case to be made for our efforts, looking at [the
                    situation] retrospectively [from the point of view] of both sides. They [the
                    Soviets] wanted to give us a black eye and to establish a Soviet presence. They
                    wanted to replace the former colonial powers and the West by the East and
                    socialism. They were also in keen rivalry with the Chinese. I would even suggest
                    that maybe they were internally rationalizing some of this to themselves by
                    their use of Guinea and Angola for the overflight purposes. This was one way in
                    which they could, in their own councils, explain why they were spending
                    ridiculous amounts of money in these parts of the world, and that there was a
                    direct, strategic payoff. Imagine, maintaining a 1200-man mission [in Guinea],
                    building factories, railroads, highways, ports, a university, hospitals. It was
                    just incredible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, everything. There was one area in which there was an economic quid
                    pro quo for the Soviets from all of this investment in West Africa. This was
                    fishing. They heavily exploited the fishing resources of that area of the
                    [South] Atlantic. In fact, they have rather drained it of fish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outside of trying to stop these [Soviet] overflights, or
                        using [Guinea] as a base for these flights, what was American policy toward
                        Guinea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was a humanitarian element to American policy toward Guinea. We had
                    a sense of responsibility for human beings in Africa. This had begun with the
                    Kennedy administration. The Peace Corps had been in and out of Guinea twice.
                    Finally, we gave up trying to keep the Peace Corps there given Toure's
                    suspicions and outbursts. We had no AID operation, except for PL 480 [activity].
                    We tried to get one little AID project going. I worked on it during the whole
                    time that I was there. It was very, very difficult to do. Obstacles were put up
                    both bureaucratically and politically at every step. It was frustrating, but we
                    felt a sense of not wanting to “abandon” the people of Guinea, who themselves
                    suffered miserably from their misguided leadership. I think that there was some
                    of this sentiment throughout Africa, combined with our reaction to the Soviet
                    presence. I don't know whether either the Soviets or we behaved in a rational
                    way in acting as if Africa was a valid field [for competition] between
                    ideologies and great powers. But the United States felt that we had to play that
                    game.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The French were totally excluded. While I was there, a very skillful,
                    young French diplomat named Andre Levin, who had been press spokesman [for] Kurt
                    Waldheim when he was Secretary General of the United Nations, was assigned to
                    Guinea as French ambassador. Waldheim had been active in trying to mend fences
                    as a mediator between Guinea, on the one hand, and France and the Federal
                    Republic of Germany, on the other, since there had been accusations of
                    interference and conspiracies. Sekou Toure went through phases of accusing the
                    Western powers of trying to overthrow him. Levin had been very skillful in
                    supporting Waldheim's mediation and had managed to ingratiate himself with Sekou
                    Toure. He was appointed to reestablish a French Embassy in Guinea. He did very
                    well. The [West] Germans also came back with a Charg� d'Affaires, about that
                    time. They were trying to keep their hand in. During all of this period, dating
                    from the early 70's, a major bauxite operation was going on — a consortium of
                    firms led by Americans, but including Canadian and some small French and [West]
                    German interests, also. That is still going on, to this day. Guinea is still the
                    world's major source of bauxite, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Guinean officialdom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Only a very few close associates of Sekou Toure had any real authority.
                    They were all “scared to death” of Sekou Toure. You had to deal with the
                    president to get much done. Bureaucratic obstacles and a kind of intellectual
                    lethargy were highly frustrating. Sekou Toure was brutal to his own ministers. I
                    remember, before going to Conakry, I called on President Kennedy's Ambassador to
                    Guinea, who had been there in the early 60s — his name escapes my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McIlhenny?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HARROP: No, before McIlhenny. This man had been an editor of “Look” magazine and
                    later wrote a book called, “The Reds and the Blacks.” He was later editor and
                    publisher of “Newsday” — his name was Bill Attwood. I went to call on him in
                    Long Island, where he was running this “Newsday”, one of the largest newspapers
                    in America. He had had a strong attachment to Guinea and had played a strong,
                    “Kennedy” role there. He had arrived in Guinea shortly after the ascent to power
                    of Sekou Toure. In his office in Long Island, I recall, he had a picture on the
                    wall of the government of Guinea at the time that he was Ambassador. He said,
                    “Well, this man was assassinated. This man died in prison. This man was tortured
                    to death. This man is now in exile.” Tears came to his eyes as he went over this
                    government of men that he thought of as his friends, all of whom had been
                    destroyed by the dictator. For me, it was a moving experience, I must say, to
                    see Attwood's very graphic recollection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your staff? How did you find that they dealt
                        with what must have been a very difficult post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We were not permitted to leave Conakry. There were some lovely mountain
                    areas — it had been a resort for most of French Africa for years during the
                    colonial period, because of the lovely climate. When you get up high, it's like
                    Baguio in the Philippines. We couldn't go to that resort area. I wanted to visit
                    a friend of mine who was Ambassador to Sierra Leone, one of the neighboring
                    countries. I couldn't even drive down there — it would have been a four-hour
                    trip — because we weren't allowed to leave the capital. Diplomats were kept in
                    town. So it was hard for the staff. It was one of those places in which you
                    depend on your internal resources. That whole small American community was
                    involved in everything that we did — everyone worked together, entertained
                    together, and had parties together. It worked out well. We had volleyball teams.
                    We built a tennis court. I think that morale normally stays higher in a post
                    like that than it does in a post like London or Rome. There is often not much
                    sense of cohesion in a large mission.</p>

                        Every year an Embassy receives a list of UN issues and reviews them with the
                        local government to try to get support. Did that bother you? I assume that
                        Guinea was always on the opposite side...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>HARROP: Usually. However, on some issues Sekou Toure was helpful. For instance,
                    he was sympathetic to us on the Cuban Missile Crisis. That occurred before I got
                    there, of course, but he had seen the American point of view on that issue and
                    admired John Kennedy. On certain other issues raised in the UN which I can't
                    recall now — possibly one of the resolutions calling for the independence of
                    Puerto Rico — he had some sympathy with the United States. He was not
                    necessarily a lost cause on such issues. The man was politically rational. He
                    was fiercely independent and did not want to be a Soviet stooge. You could deal
                    with him. Strangely enough, I rather enjoyed working with him. He was the
                    prototype of post independence African socialist leaders.I remember two
                    different conversations I had with him. On one occasion I was trying to persuade
                    him to allow the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring a team of
                    experts to give him some advice on how to manage his economy. He said, “Look,
                    that's fine for a country like Switzerland or Belgium, but in this country the
                    IMF and IBRD are irrelevant. They understand nothing about Africa. We couldn't
                    possibly implement the policies they recommend, these free market things. It
                    would not work. It's out of the question for me to accept their advice.”</p>
                <p>On another occasion he called me over for one of those very early morning
                    meetings. It was interesting. There are two parts to the story. He summoned me
                    at 6:00 or 7:00 AM. I had the feeling that he hadn't slept all night. He looked
                    just exhausted. If a black man can look pale, he did. He looked wan and just
                    sad. He said, “You know, Ambassador, I'm so fed up with these Guinean people of
                    mine.” I said, “What do you mean, Mr. President?” He said, “Well, over and over
                    again I've explained to them and demonstrated and told them that they must work
                    for the good of everyone. They must work, not for themselves but for all of
                    society and for all of the people. But they won't work — they won't do it. I'm
                    just sick of them. They won't do the job that they've got to do to make this
                    country great.” He did not seem aware that this was a vivid admission of the
                    failure of his Socialist philosophical approach. Later that morning, I recall,
                    there was a big political rally in the football stadium, where he would assembly
                    10,000 people to hear him speak. The diplomats sat on one side — we were very
                    regimented. He was in his classic white outfit — everyone had to wear pure white
                    robes — waving the white handkerchief he always carried. He looked the same to
                    me as he had looked two hours earlier — absolutely exhausted, tired out. He
                    began speaking, and I marveled to watch a politician taking sustenance from the
                    crowd. You could almost see the blood flowing into his veins, you could sense
                    the oxygen, you could see him begin to absorb energy from the crowd he was
                    addressing. Then, by the end, he was his charismatic self — a fascinating thing
                    to watch. I knew that he was drained and discouraged, and yet that political
                    life came back into him as he spoke to his people. It was an interesting
                    experience. Toure was a remarkable orator. He could speak for hours and would
                    often publish the verbatim text — I have a dozen of these books he gave me. His
                    extemporaneous rhetoric would emerge — in fact, was — orderly sentences,
                    paragraphs and chapters, although in the substantive content was balderdash.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Several years after that Sekou Toure died. It must have been six or eight years
                    later [about 1980]. He died in a hospital in the United States. He was brought
                    back to Pittsburgh — ALCOA's headquarters — by the bauxite company in Guinea. He
                    died there, leaving behind complete chaos. No succession had been organized at
                    all. Finally, a succession emerged which strongly backed free enterprise,
                    capitalism, human rights. One of the tragedies of Africa is that the Western
                    world was unable to respond to their call for investment after they had adopted
                    the market economic policies we had been pressing upon them for years.</p>

                    years.</p>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>HARROP: Dick Moose is a man of tremendous energy, personal charm, and, I believe,
                    of decency. He's a straightforward, open person who has a strong view of how he
                    thinks the world should be. It's essentially a liberal view — at least at that
                    time it was a very liberal view. He was open to Africans, very concerned about
                    racism in South Africa and in Rhodesia and about getting rid of the vestiges of
                    colonialism. He worked very hard on that subject, particularly on Rhodesia and
                    the independence of Zimbabwe. He was effective in this effort, I must say. I
                    think that he played a major role in that whole affair. He had begun these
                    efforts, as you suggest, at the beginning of the Carter administration. He was
                    appointed Under Secretary for Management and held that job for only a few
                    months. I recall that I met him in Abidjan [Ivory Coast], where there was an
                    Africa Chiefs of Mission conference — it must have been in April or May of 1977,
                    and I was in Guinea. He was still Under Secretary for Management at that time.
                    Bill Schaufele was Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, nearing the end of
                    his time in that position. Dick Moose is very concerned about people. He asked
                    everybody's advice about the really good people in the Foreign Service for
                    appointments of various kinds. He felt that the job of Under Secretary for
                    Management was mainly a “people” job — keeping lists and so on.</p>
                <p>Shortly after that it came to light that he, in fact, was going to take the
                    position of Assistant Secretary for Africa and leave management. The feeling at
                    the time was that he had not worked out well in the position of Under Secretary
                    for Management, had not been cut out for it, had not seemed suited for
                    administrative work, and was much more suited to run a geographic bureau. That's
                    why he changed. It was a sensitive topic to discuss, particularly with someone
                    who was your senior. I never went over that subject with him, although we became
                    good friends. I don't really know how he saw that matter himself, but my guess
                    would be that now — 15 years later — he sees himself as accepting a challenge.
                    Maybe he always wanted to be Under Secretary for Management. He may feel that he
                    has a bit of history to set right and needs to go back and do the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the present time he is Under Secretary for
                        Management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, he is. He didn't begin in the [Clinton] administration — Brian
                    Atwood had the job to start with. Then Atwood was shifted to be Administrator of
                    AID, and, all of a sudden, to my astonishment, Dick reappeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role in AF?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>HARROP: My role really was doing most things that were not directly related to
                    South Africa or Southern Africa — Rhodesia, Namibia, Angola. Those areas Dick
                    handled himself, with tremendous concern and close attention. He traveled a
                    great deal. He became a close associate, really, of British Foreign Secretary
                    David Owen, now Lord Owen who is presently involved in the affairs of the former
                    Yugoslavia, [on behalf of the European Union]. In 1978/79 Owen was working very
                    hard to resolve the Rhodesia situation. I handled most of the management of the
                    Bureau of African Affairs, in effect running the Bureau. The other, major
                    political problem area that we had at the time was the “Horn of Africa,” with
                    which I was concerned. Those were the two big issues we had. Well, there was
                    also Zaire. Zaire is always an issue in Africa. There were two “invasions” of
                    Zaire [by mercenaries] in 1977 and 1978. The United States was concerned about
                    both of these matters. Moose and I both worked on that, but by this time Lannon
                    Walker had come back on the scene. He had been DCM in Zaire and was now the
                    Office Director for Central Africa. He didn't need all of that much support. He
                    knew Zaire very well.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on matters concerned with the Horn of Africa.</p>

                        situation in the Horn of Africa, and what were our concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The revolution in Ethiopia had occurred in 1974. [Colonel] Mengistu came
                    to power — a very bloodthirsty ruler and a very harsh man, in some respects not
                    unlike Sekou Toure, who tried to impose communism or his own brand of socialism
                    on a society which didn't really understand it. The Soviets had been gaining
                    major influence in Somalia for several years. Some time in late 1975 or early
                    1976 the Somalis invaded the Ogaden area [of Ethiopia] and tried to take back
                    what they regarded as part of their historical territory. A bitter war ensued
                    between Ethiopia and Somalia, with the Soviets switching sides to support
                    Somalia, militarily. The Ethiopians were operating, to a large extent, with
                    American arms which we had provided to Emperor Haile Selassie. It was a major
                    war and quite costly in terms of casualties. It was a very delicate and
                    difficult challenge for the Carter administration, because in this case there
                    was a juxtaposition of the usual, Cold War considerations. The situation did not
                    easily fit our Cold War attitudes. It was a fascinating period.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>HARROP: We had several different purposes. One was to reduce or oppose Soviet
                    influence, in both countries. The Soviets were caught in a very bad position.
                    Actually, at the outset they were supporting both sides. They had been behind
                    Siad Barre's regime in Somalia, but after the revolution in Ethiopia they were
                    very close to Mengistu, an avowed Marxist. This war began, as I say, with
                    American weapons in Ethiopian hands. Soon after, the Soviets were providing the
                    arms to both sides. In the end they chose to support Ethiopia over Somalia. They
                    drew back from Siad Barre. We were then in the quandary of trying to decide if
                    we were going to support this opportunistic fellow [Siad Barre] who was
                    certainly the aggressor, against the Ethiopians. We resisted the impulse to
                    provide large scale military help to Somalia but we tried very hard to negotiate
                    a settlement. We wanted to see Soviet influence diminished, we wanted to see the
                    influence of communism diminished in both countries, and we wanted to see
                    stability in the area. It was undesirable to have another conflagration going on
                    in Africa. We wanted to see longer term economic development of the two
                    countries, which we saw as being in our interest, both economically and
                    politically.</p>
                <p>In February, 1978, I took part in a rather remarkable trip. By that time the
                    Somalis were being pushed back out of the Ogaden and we were close to a
                    negotiated cease-fire between Somalia and Ethiopia. [Zbigniew] Brzezinski's
                    deputy as National Security Adviser in the Carter administration was David
                    Aaron, who is now, under the Clinton administration, Ambassador to the OECD
                    [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] in Paris. Aaron led a
                    mission to see Mengistu. It was the first contact between the American
                    government and the new Ethiopian government. This was four years after it [the
                    new Ethiopian government] came into power. I went on that trip, along with the
                    National Security Council expert on the Horn of Africa, Paul Henze:, who
                    previously had been assigned there. In fact, he wrote a book about Ethiopia,
                    called “Travels in Ethiopia.” Henze, Aaron, and I went out on this trip. I was
                    to represent the Department of State.</p>
                <p>The three of us went to England, where we picked up a large aircraft, with only
                    the three of us aboard. This U.S. Air Force plane flew us down from Heathrow
                    Airport [London] to Ethiopia. We had a remarkable, four-hour meeting with
                    Mengistu, trying to talk through a settlement. It was not entirely
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Mengistu?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>HARROP: I think that Mengistu presented more of a surface confidence than he
                    actually felt. He was in a very correct and well-pressed, military uniform with
                    polished boots. He was sitting in what had been the office of [Emperor] Haile
                    Selassie, in Haile Selassie's palace. I was told that the office was unchanged,
                    except for a prominent bust of Lenin which had been added in the corner. I had
                    the same experience as a couple of members of Congress, whom I had spoken to a
                    few weeks before — Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Don Bonker of Washington.
                    Tsongas was then a member of the House of Representatives. They had just
                    returned from a visit to Ethiopia when I talked to them. They had been the first
                    Americans of any official standing to call on Mengistu. Tsongas and Bonker told
                    me that they had sat in that same room which I subsequently sat in, talking with
                    Mengistu. They heard the late Emperor's lions roaring underneath. The late
                    Emperor's office was cantilevered out over the grounds of the Palace zoo. The
                    lions were growling beneath. Paul Tsongas said he couldn't help but wonder if
                    Mengistu had a button that he could push there which would open the floor, and
                    the visitors would fall down among the lions. I had the same feeling as I talked
                    to Mengistu. We all heard the growling of those lions below us.</p>
                <p>It was a long meeting. Mengistu was very difficult to reach. He really understood
                    English pretty well but used the old trick of waiting for the interpreter every
                    time. So the meeting dragged on. We didn't see much “yield” or much “give” from
                    him. Subsequently, not too long afterwards, he did agree to stop the war which
                    he had effectively won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We were trying to get a cease-fire, trying to stop the war over the
                    Ogaden. More specifically, we were actually trying to head off an Ethiopian
                    occupation of Somalia. The Ethiopians had really broken through the Somali lines
                    by that time and were in a position, I think, to sweep through to the sea. We
                    were trying to talk them out of that. In the end they did not do it, to their
                    great credit; they had said from the outset that they did not have territorial
                    ambitions beyond the Ogaden. So it turned out that they did not advance beyond
                    the Ogaden and into Somalia.</p>
                <p>Well, I don't have much else to say about Mengistu. I would say that he was an
                    introverted, a closed man. You couldn't easily tell what he was thinking. He
                    seemed to me to be less confident than he wanted to appear to be. This personal
                    insecurity is a danger in a person like that, because he can lash out, as he
                    repeatedly demonstrated that he could. I think that Mengistu is very fortunate
                    to be alive today. He is living on a farm in Zimbabwe — a very fortunate man to
                    survive in view of all the people that he personally killed.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>At any rate, I attended a number of quadripartite meetings in London, which
                    seemed to be the headquarters for them, with the French, British, Italians, and
                    Americans talking over our policies toward the [Ogaden] war. I followed that
                    area closely for several years. It was a most interesting time to be doing
                    that.</p>
                <p>They were interesting meetings because the four powers had somewhat different
                    purposes, I think. The British and Italians had some residual concern for
                    Eritrea and Somalia, because of their former, colonial position there. In Italy
                    the whole history of Ethiopia has been a kind of strange cultural and political
                    phenomenon. There's a museum on Ethiopia and Eritrea in Rome. There's a little
                    bit of German national guilt toward the holocaust in Italian thinking toward
                    their historical role — Mussolini's role, in fact — in the Horn of Africa. The
                    French participated in the talks because they're an important power, with a
                    military presence in Djibouti, and because they want to be “in” on things. They
                    saw a possibility for developing their influence. These were very interesting
                    meetings, I must say. In the end there was pretty good cooperation among the
                    four western powers because the overall purpose of all four was to reestablish
                    stability and not have their other interests in Africa and their Cold War
                    interests upended by this war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time were we looking for an opportunity to pick up
                        some [military] bases? Did we think that, if the Ethiopians go this way,
                        we'll pick up the Somalis, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We were accused of that, and our policy was rather controversial in the
                    Administration and in the country generally. There were some particularly Cold
                    War conscious people who thought that we should develop a position in Somalia to
                    oppose the Soviet position in Ethiopia. In fact, this came out a number of times
                    in the form of Zbigniew Brzezinski's strategic analyses about the great
                    importance of the Horn, and of course we did negotiate base rights in Somalia.
                    In the end, we never really developed a lasting military presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, at least until the winter of 1979, when the
                        Soviets took over Afghanistan — that the Carter administration was trying a
                        little harder to downplay the Soviet threat and trying to look at things on
                        a country to country basis, rather than looking at everything in terms of
                        the East-West confrontation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Oh, very much so. I think that it was a kind of an educational experience
                    for the Carter administration — as events around the world unfolded — to find
                    itself, almost in spite of itself, looking at the bipolar nature of the
                    situation and reacting to the Soviets.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Actually, Secretary Cyrus Vance and the State Department basically wanted to
                    avoid a Russia-centric, cold war based policy, and suspected the NSC of being
                    far more hard line. The Carter administration placed a tremendous emphasis on
                    human rights. I might mention, as a brief digression, the striking elements of
                    that April, 1977, African Chiefs of Mission conference in Abidjan where, as I
                    mentioned, I met Dick Moose. The lady who later or perhaps already had become
                    the flamboyant representative for human rights in the Department of State was at
                    that meeting, her first exposure to senior career diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pat Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Pat Derian. Her point of view and her perspective was astonishing to the
                    traditional ambassadors who were there at that meeting. Gradually, her point of
                    view began to prevail in the Department of State. President Carter really felt
                    strongly about human rights. I would say that regarding human rights concerns as
                    a real component of American foreign policy was a lasting legacy of the Carter
                    administration. It goes on to this day in a very strong sense, and has
                    essentially been internalized in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sort of reluctantly I have come to the conclusion
                        that that was one of the keys to the collapse of the Soviet Union, when we
                        started playing to our strength instead of to the Soviet strength, which was
                        covert activity, messing around, and that type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It's a fascinating thing. That's just a small example of how human rights
                    came to play a major role in practical terms and why it was so difficult for the
                    Carter administration to come to grips with the realities of the Cold War. I
                    would say that one regime for which the Carter administration had the least
                    affection for or interest or sympathy of any kind was Mobutu's Zaire. The Carter
                    administration just hated Mobutu. He represented everything that they were
                    hostile to, in the field of human rights and everything else. And yet, when the
                    “rump” invasions of Katanga — now Shaba Province — took place, by mercenaries
                    and other elements, he [President Carter] found himself providing air support
                    for Mobutu and reinvolving the United States in Zaire on the side of the
                    central, Mobutu government against Soviet-supported efforts to frighten it out
                    of the country. I think that it was a very hard thing for the Carter
                    administration to do — I know it was, because I was working in the Bureau of
                    African Affairs at the time. It was a difficult set of issues, and we probably
                    did the right thing. However, Mobutu has lasted a lot longer than anyone thought
                    that he would and has been the source of dreadful human suffering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about this. Did the Carter administration
                        subscribe to our general policy of not supporting local, provincial, tribal,
                        or whatever you want to call them, revolts? Was this the overriding
                        consideration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>HARROP: The Carter Administration wanted to view local conflicts as such, not as
                    part of a general confrontation with Moscow. But as the months went by it became
                    impossible not to evaluate these clashes somewhat in Cold War terms. Mobutu, for
                    all of his blemishes, was always four-square on the side of the United States.
                    He expelled Soviet ambassadors and supported American views in the United
                    Nations. It seems to me that he's been very astute and for a very long time. His
                    was, for instance, the first African government to restore relations with Israel
                    after the six-day war, and the first to answer Carter's call for a boycott of
                    the Moscow Olympics in '78. Many “good friends” of America, otherwise unsavory,
                    were very skillful at taking advantage of the Cold War. Mobutu was one of them.
                    So a [mercenary] intervention [in Zaire] was seen somewhat in that light.
                    However, the realities of American national interest and realpolitik
                    considerations led the Carter administration to oppose the fragmentation of
                    Africa. The Carter administration learned that there were American national and
                    strategic interests which had to balanced against universal values of human
                    rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the African corps — the
                        African specialists in the Foreign Service and the Department of State at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that, historically, these have been good quality people who have
                    learned a great deal about that part of the world and have performed there, by
                    and large, very well. They include leaders such as Hank Cohen, Ed Perkins,
                    Princeton Lyman, Bill Edmondson, Bob Keeley, Bob Oakley, and many others whom I
                    could name — really excellent people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the problem, at least in terms of the
                        “corridor reputation” of ARA, the Bureau of American Republic Affairs? The
                        problem is that people tend to serve in ARA so long that they really don't
                        see any other part of the world. Did you find that African specialists
                        should take a little broader view [of events] or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that there is a danger of becoming too specialized. What we saw
                    very often, interestingly enough, was a migration to Africa at the ambassadorial
                    level of people from Asia, but more often from Europe. This was because there
                    would be a large corps of officers of very high quality in Europe and no access
                    to embassies in “their” part of the world since these were taken up by political
                    appointees. So we had a stream of ambassadors appointed to African posts, coming
                    from Europe, who had not previously served in Africa. That has had very mixed
                    results, actually. I tend to believe that diplomacy is a profession of skills
                    which are geographically transferable. If you can handle government issues and
                    American interests and problems in Helsinki, why you can probably do it also in
                    Kuala Lumpur. I happen to believe that. But we did have some experiences in
                    Africa with ambassadors from other areas which did not work out awfully well.
                    But some Foreign Service African experts have performed very well in other areas
                    — for example, Ray Seitz, now Ambassador to the UK, and Frank Wisner, now Under
                    Secretary of Defense, not to mention Frank Carlucci.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we were talking about this, I thought of another
                        factor, too, with the Latin American types. There is so much diversity in
                        that area, and many of the posts aren't that bad [to serve in]. They tend to
                        go to Washington and back to Latin American posts, whereas many of the
                        African posts are difficult. So somebody serves for a while in Paris, or in
                        Asia. Eventually, as a relief, they are given a post some place else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think to a greater extent than in Latin America, but not as much as you
                    might think. I think we have had too many officers whose lives revolve around
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>You know, we went through that period with Henry Kissinger when he was just
                    determined to...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “GLOP” [Global Perspective].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: “GLOP.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, the [initial] idea was to break up the group of
                        Latin American specialists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was about Latin America, at least partly so. But the more important
                    thing, from Kissinger's point of view, was that he wanted “his” diplomats to
                    think of American strategic interests in global terms. He felt that we were a
                    global power and not a regional power. He felt that you had to serve in various
                    parts of the world to understand that.</p>
                <p>There was a lot to be said for what he meant. You always have a tension in a
                    diplomatic service between “generalists” and “specialists.” You have a similar
                    tension between area expertise and broader functional expertise. Maybe that's
                    another form of the difference between generalists and specialists. The tension
                    is always there — there's no answer to it. It's important, but not necessarily a
                    bad thing.</p>

                        then until 1983 as Ambassador to Kenya. How did that assignment come about?
                        For one thing, one looks at this and says, “Kenya is the sort of place which
                        a lot of political appointees thirst to have.” How did you happen to get
                        that post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>HARROP: I was probably fortunate. I replaced a political appointee, Wilbert
                    LeMelle and was replaced by another political appointee, Admiral Gerald Thomas.
                    I don't know — it just happened that way. The position was coming open — I think
                    that there was a little dissatisfaction, perhaps, [in the Department] with
                    Ambassador LeMelle and a feeling that it might be time to send a professional
                    diplomat to Kenya.</p>
                <p>It was a fine tour from my point of view. Kenya is a country of great
                    fascination. The British heritage there, I think, was as strong as in any of the
                    former British colonies. There was a sense, when I arrived in 1980, that Kenya
                    had greater prospects of success than almost any other place in Africa, because
                    it appeared to have a better balance [than most other African countries had]. It
                    appeared to have a better appreciation of the “rule of law.” It appeared to have
                    something closer to a true democracy, a parliament that had some effectiveness,
                    a respect for property rights, and a certain degree of free enterprise. It had
                    substantial natural endowments and many capable people. It also had a lot of
                    former British colonials who had stayed on and had become, in fact, Kenyan
                    citizens. This was seen as providing balance and a rudder for the country.</p>
                <p>However, even while I was there, worry grew over the level of corruption, a
                    concern that has become endemic to Africa, often in connection with all
                    ethnicity. We saw tribal issues in Kenya that refused to go away and became
                    very, very destructive. Then there was the ambition of individual leaders who
                    would not bow to democracy, quite evident at that time. So the handwriting was
                    pretty much on the wall. We also had had some rather difficult relations with
                    Kenya over economic questions. We were trying to support the Bretton Woods
                    institutions [the IMF and the World Bank], which advocated imposing more
                    classical budget stringency and discipline on the Kenyan economy, trying to
                    shrink the parastatal sector and to reduce a really exorbitant level of price
                    controls. On the other hand Kenya became important to our problems in the
                    Gulf.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>HARROP: The Persian Gulf, yes. Kenya was really the only location on the Western
                    rim of the Indian Ocean where we could provide shore leave for our sailors. At
                    that time we always had a Carrier Task Force near the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
                    So we negotiated agreements providing military access to Kenya. It was very
                    difficult for President Moi to agree to this, because of Kenya's tradition
                    independence. He didn't want to be subservient to the United States and didn't
                    want any military alliances. So the [port access] agreements were public and
                    publicly ratified by the Senate of the United States but were secret in Kenya, a
                    most unusual and really unworkable situation. We had as many as 40 ship visits a
                    year for a time — to Mombasa. We got into some difficult, bilateral problems.
                    Two different prostitutes were murdered or were killed by American sailors in
                    two consecutive years while I was in Kenya, under circumstances which obviously
                    were complicated and difficult to unravel, extremely political. We had trials,
                    bilateral frictions, and great emotion over those issues, which, in fact,
                    absorbed a disproportionate amount of my time.</p>

                        country and how did you deal with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: [Jomo] Kenyatta had died in 1978 and had been replaced by his vice
                    president, Daniel arap Moi. Kenyatta was a member of the Kikuyu tribe, the
                    largest group, which had been the heart of the rebellion against the British in
                    the 1950's. His vice president, Moi, was from a small, minority tribe, called
                    the Kalenjin. Somehow, the formal succession system held together. Moi acceded
                    to power as Vice President and then was reelected. He is not an educated man —
                    he did not complete secondary school — and appears to be somewhat slow-witted.
                    Actually, he is cunning in understanding power and the tribal politics of
                    Africa, which is what the politics on that continent come down to. The common
                    denominator is ethnic rivalries. While I was there, Moi was consolidating his
                    position as president and doing so quite successfully. He had a group of cronies
                    from his own tribe around him who were extremely corrupt — not just in political
                    but in money terms. He was himself involved in a lot of business ventures. There
                    was a revolt by the Air Force while I was there — in August, 1981. That was put
                    down, but you could see on the horizon that the clouds were there and that there
                    was going to be more trouble. There has been more trouble, and the Moi regime
                    has become more and more authoritarian.</p>
                <p>We had considerable American investments in Kenya and some bilateral trade. Kenya
                    is a tremendous tourist destination for Westerners and for Americans. There are
                    many Americans in Kenya at any given time. Kenya is also the headquarters of the
                    United Nations Environmental Program, a specialized UN agency with its central
                    office in Nairobi. Nairobi was a very busy place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are, the American Ambassador, in an area with a
                        lot of business activity and Americans coming there and working there.
                        Corruption is endemic and massive. How do you function in this type of
                        situation? We have this attitude that, “We don't mess around with corruption
                        and all of that.” Yet this is how things are done. How did you keep the
                        Embassy going and give advice to [American business firms]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It's a very difficult proposition, and I saw more of it in Zaire. I can't
                    recall the year when the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was passed [by Congress].
                    It must have been some time in the 1980's. I was more directly involved in
                    [these matters] in Zaire than I was in Kenya, although I think [that this law]
                    may already have been in force [when I was in Kenya]. American companies
                    overseas just can't engage in bribery or “sweetening” of officers because
                    they'll get in trouble with their own Department of Justice. Also, the majority
                    of American companies feel that, over the long pull, they're better off not
                    doing that anyway. That's not always the case, but the big companies feel that
                    way. We had a few big companies that were very successful in Kenya. Delmonte was
                    very successful in growing pineapple on a large scale and exporting it to
                    Europe. Some of the American pharmaceutical companies were there, General Motors
                    assembled motor vehicles in Kenya, the Corn Products Company was involved in
                    food production and packaging, Union Carbide manufacturing batteries, and there
                    were quite a few others. It was an active place. It's a difficult thing to be in
                    competition when you have the government openly corrupt, openly trying to get
                    payoffs and bribes from companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's say that an American businessman comes to you or
                        your commercial officers. He says that somebody's asked for this or that
                        [kind of bribe], and he's a cabinet minister. He asks, “What do I do?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that the only thing that an ambassador can do is to tell him that
                    he can't pay bribes. That became literally the case when the Foreign Corrupt
                    Practices Act was passed. You try to support him as best you can. I had many
                    meetings with cabinet ministers and with President Moi himself in support of
                    individual American companies and interests. Often, I supported them
                    institutionally. I had meetings every month with American business
                    representatives at my residence in Nairobi and talked over issues that were
                    coming up. When there were customs or tax issues or regulatory problems, I would
                    go to bat for them — often successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that, in a way, if you carry on a policy such
                        as this and really stick to it, the government and the people involved
                        conclude that there is no point messing around with Americans and that it's
                        more trouble than it's worth. Did you find that this worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, unfortunately, all too often the Americans decide that it's not
                    worth it. My concern is that Americans kind of cop out, on the grounds that it's
                    too much trouble, it is too costly, too much red tape, it is personally too
                    difficult for them, from the ethical point of view, and also, it's risky for
                    them legally. So you have American companies that opt out of a developing
                    country, often after years of presence. A major American tire company backed out
                    of Kenya while I was there. [It decided that it] didn't want to produce tires
                    any more, because it was too costly, too much hassle. It's too bad to see that,
                    although you cannot argue about a decision based on the balance sheet. American
                    firms retain a certain prestige in Africa. Local people want to work with them
                    and for them. For both political and economic reasons it was useful for Kenya to
                    have them there, among other reasons as a foil to British firms. Some contracts
                    were lost to Europeans because, when you have two, comparable firms — and one
                    will make payoffs and one won't — the first tends to get the nod in Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Oh, they're much less sensitive or much less “correct” than Americans are
                    in this regard, if you can generalize in that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much to do with President Moi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, I saw the president every few weeks. I felt that I developed a
                    degree of personal relationship with him, although he's not a warm man, a bit
                    withdrawn. There was always that sense of tension over economic issues and, more
                    importantly, over military issues and human rights questions. He was always
                    reserved on human rights issues. I was repeatedly instructed to go in and “bang
                    the table” on human rights. Then we had some very difficult Congressional visits
                    when some of our more liberal Congressmen would criticize President Moi and his
                    human rights practices in an outspoken and public way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the human rights problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were people in jail for political dissent. There was a refusal to
                    allow opposition parties to organize, the authority of Parliament was
                    circumscribed. Newspaper editors were arrested — the usual things.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HARROP: Probably somewhat so in the case of the executive branch [of our
                    government], but Congress was still controlled by the Democratic Party. Some of
                    the people in positions of authority in the committees interested in Africa were
                    very keenly concerned about human rights and were very outspoken about it. They
                    kept pressing us and pressing the Moi Government [on such matters]. So you had
                    the case of the executive and legislative branches taking a somewhat different
                    attitude.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There is a tradition of free speech in Kenya, so the [local] media
                    continued to try to keep after these issues, and would be put down, over and
                    over again — and more and more harshly. It was a confrontation which just did
                    not end. President Moi was consolidating his personal power all the while, and
                    successfully. He was getting rid of possible opponents within the system. There
                    was a resentment in the government, on the part of President Moi and his
                    immediate supporters, of this persistent American concern over human rights.
                    However, you felt that they recognized this was something that they were going
                    to have to live with and that it wasn't going to go away.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were continuing problems. With Tanzania there was no love lost
                    between [Julius] Nyerere and [President] Moi, as you can imagine. The Tanzanians
                    were trying to establish a socialist society, depicting Kenya as heartlessly
                    corrupt and capitalist. Uganda was in turmoil with insurrection and continual
                    warfare. The same thing could be said of the Sudan. There was a sense of
                    complete hostility between Kenya and Siad Barre's Somalia, and then there was
                    persistent marauding over the border by ethnic Somalis. There is some Kenyan
                    admixture in the population of Somalia. There were tensions all the way around.
                    The area in which we played the greatest role was in supporting a United Nations
                    effort to mediate the historical problems among Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania —
                    the old East African Federation under the United Kingdom. There was a quite
                    brilliant, former central banker from Switzerland, named Ulrich, a man for whom
                    I have great admiration. Just as I was leaving he finally succeeded in
                    negotiating out the interests of the three parties in the complicated common
                    possessions of East African Community under the British regime. This led to a
                    lessening of tension, with Tanzania opening the border with Kenya. The border
                    was closed almost the whole time that I was there. You couldn't easily travel
                    across the border to Tanzania.</p>

                <p>HARROP: I think that I might mention the unusual circumstances of population
                    questions. Kenya, at that time — and perhaps still — has the highest population
                    growth rate in the world: about 4.0 percent annually. This meant that Kenya
                    would double in population — I think the arithmetic states that this would
                    happen every 17 years. There also was a persistent migration toward the cities.
                    About half of the population of Nairobi was unemployed. Crime was beginning to
                    grow. We spent a lot of time — most of our very large AID program was devoted to
                    family planning programs, in which the Kenyans were interested.</p>

                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We kept it up. We were able to keep it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Reagan administration was taking a rather strong
                        stand...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: They did, and even though a new Assistant Administrator for Africa in AID
                    was appointed, a Catholic who was ideologically and religiously opposed to
                    family planning, we still kept the program going.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do it by not asking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, they weren't able to stop the program. The momentum was there, and
                    they weren't able to stop it. There was no issue of abortion, which was the most
                    sensitive issue during the Reagan administration. We worked very hard, and the
                    Kenyans worked hard. I think that we actually made some progress. I understand
                    that [population growth in Kenya] is now down to something slightly over 3.0
                    percent, which is phenomenal progress. But [population growth] was a major
                    problem and will continue to be. Kenya was self-sufficient in food but, I
                    believe no longer is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick this interview up next time, when you serve as
                        Inspector General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: OK. Very good. — Q: Today is November 4, 1993. This is a continuation of
                    a conversation with Ambassador Harrop. Bill, we stopped when you had just left
                    Kenya and were going to be the Inspector General. You were in that position from
                    1983 to 1986. Could you give me an idea of how the job was presented to you when
                    you took it over, because the role of the Inspector General waxes, wanes, and
                    changes all the time?</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HARROP: Secretary of State George Shultz wanted to make the point that he was
                    concerned about management and that he was establishing a new “management team,”
                    as he put it, in the Department of State. He was going to pay more attention to
                    managing the institution than other Secretaries had done. So he appointed three
                    new people at one time: Ron Spiers as Under Secretary for Management, Roy
                    Atherton as Director General [of the Foreign Service], and me as Inspector
                    General. He made some public statements about that, and we had kind of
                    semi-public swearing in of the three of us, at which the Secretary spoke about
                    what he hoped to achieve.</p>
                <p>Not a great deal of thought had been given to what the role of the Inspector
                    General would be. It was more the framework of a new management approach to the
                    Department of State. In fact, Ron Spiers who, as Under Secretary for Management,
                    was the senior of the three [of us], established a system of weekly Management
                    Council meetings at which the Inspector General, the Director General, the
                    Director of the Foreign Service Institute, the Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration, and the Chief Budget Officer [of the Department of State] would
                    talk about the issues of the day and try to apply our collective wisdom to the
                    problems of budget, personnel, and administration.</p>
                <p>As I say, I don't think that a great deal of thought had been given to the role
                    of the Inspector General. This has historically been a somewhat different
                    function in other parts of the government than in the Department of State. In
                    other departments — it is much more the investigation of malfeasance or actual
                    crime in other departments — combined with auditing in a rather technical sense.
                    In the Department of State, historically, the emphasis has been put upon the
                    improvement of operations through inspections. I think that both sides — both
                    the Department of State and the other agencies — benefited during the time that
                    I was there by a set of circumstances which brought those two approaches into
                    closer [contact]. Well, at first, there was conflict, and then, I think, each
                    benefited in the end.</p>
                <p>The Department of State began to acknowledge that Foreign Service Officers were
                    not above petty crime and chiseling like everyone else in the world. We paid a
                    little more attention to the investigative side and also began to apply more
                    technically correct auditing systems — really auditing our finances,
                    administrative operations, and procedures to try to be more technically
                    proficient and correct on the money side than the Department of State had been
                    previously. I think that the other agencies began to understand that the notion
                    of a “non confrontational inspection,” designed to improve the way in which
                    business was done, of having an inspector work together with a chief of mission,
                    a bureau head, or the head of any kind of a segment of operations to make that
                    segment or that embassy work better, were pretty good ideas. That is now being
                    done [more frequently] in other parts of our government than before.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>This cross fertilization took place because there had been for several years a
                    Presidential Council on Integrity and Efficiency, which is chaired by the Deputy
                    Director of the Office of Management and Budget. This brings together all
                    Inspectors General. A meeting was held once a month or sometimes every two weeks
                    to discuss general management issues and general operational matters in the
                    federal government. It was at those meetings that this difference [of approach]
                    really began to come out. There was more of a “rubbing of shoulders” between the
                    Department of State/Foreign Service approach and that of other departments at
                    that time, for a variety of reasons.</p>
                <p>I felt that we had developed a tool which could benefit the entire federal
                    system. My approach was strongly one of trying to work in a non-provocative
                    fashion and to improve operations, although it became evident that we did have
                    enough crime and enough problems of malfeasance that we had to focus more
                    heavily on that. One of the great difficulties of the work of an Inspector
                    General, particularly in organizations like the Department of State and the
                    Foreign Service, which are rather small, elite groups, is that the Department of
                    Justice is very reluctant to prosecute cases of malfeasance. I can remember a
                    number of occasions when we found that Foreign Service or Department of State
                    people had “chiseled” on travel vouchers or had somehow pocketed, say, $5,000 in
                    one way or another. When I went to the Attorney General and urged him to
                    prosecute, because an exemplary finding would be so useful to us in improving
                    our performance in the Department of State, I found great resistance. From his
                    point of view, it's extremely costly to prosecute, it means bringing witnesses —
                    particularly in the Foreign Service — from all over the world, at great cost,
                    and it means taking the time of prosecutors and lawyers to do the job. In fact,
                    there is very little in it for the Treasury out of the “small potatoes” that we
                    represented. They just had to save their resources, they said, for the major
                    prosecutorial jobs that they had — there were much larger amounts of money or
                    much more important systemic issues involved. So it was very difficult for us to
                    get the exemplary findings that I'd like to have gotten to stop people short and
                    make Foreign Service people understand that there was wrongdoing in their own
                    organization as well as others, that they were not “pristine,” that there were
                    people watching them, and that they had to shape up and act properly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to do anything administratively if you
                        caught someone...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, encouraged very much by Secretary Shultz, we put a great focus on
                    “management by objectives.” We tried very hard to instill an instinctive
                    “management by objectives” approach in the Foreign Service, whether that was
                    called “goals and objectives” or a “program plan” or a “working blueprint” or
                    whatever we wanted to call it. We went through several different iterations to
                    try to get chiefs of mission and bureau heads really to think in terms of
                    setting out in detail what they hoped to achieve in a given period of time and
                    how they were going to deploy their resources to do that. To set up measurable
                    “mile markers” and “achievement points” which could be reflected in budget terms
                    and in performance evaluations.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I think that as an institution we have actually made some progress. Secretary
                    Shultz was very keen on the subject, and so was I. The heart of that effort
                    really was in the Inspector General's office. The Foreign Service instinctively
                    resists “management by objectives.” The Foreign Service is a highly pragmatic
                    institution, as we know, and as Senator Helms [Republican, North Carolina] so
                    resents. A Foreign Service Officer will normally say that it's not possible for
                    him to predict when an insurgency is going to begin, when elections are going to
                    be won or lost, when a currency is going to be devalued, when an earthquake may
                    take place, when an American will be taken hostage. These are the things which
                    he or she has to deal with every day. You can't just set out a simple array of
                    things you're going to achieve, the argument runs. You're working in the real
                    world, and so forth.</p>
                <p>Of course, the answer to that is that if you operate in a purely “responsive”
                    mode, without planning, you're not going to achieve anything. All you're going
                    to do is react to events. You have to have your own program, your own purposes,
                    and your own detailed objective to be effective. We talked through this subject
                    over and over again, and I think that people in the Foreign Service have
                    gradually come to realize that you do have to think ahead, more than was their
                    practice in the past. So I'm pleased to have had some part in that.</p>
                <p>We also made some progress on matters of ethics. I was able to introduce a couple
                    of ideas. We circulated a “pre-inspection” program for posts to run through in
                    building up to an inspection, a more detailed exercise than had been the case in
                    the past. People commonly conclude that the major achievement of an inspection
                    will turn out to have been the work done to prepare for it. We tried to make
                    that more tangible. We also tried, in terms of ethics, to make clearer to
                    everyone, from chiefs of mission down, just what the ground rules were. Foreign
                    Service Officers, diplomats, tend to be overworked and terribly busy and don't
                    really spend a lot of time reading regulations and laws about their own conduct
                    and their own behavior. The Foreign Service had to become more sensitized to the
                    notion that you can't take a “free” airplane trip from someone and you can't
                    take different types of benefits from people without breaking American law and
                    without putting yourself in a very dubious position. We worked hard to make that
                    clearer, with some rather pointed disciplinary examples, in the cases of a
                    couple of ambassadors. Ethical lapses were more likely to involve non-career
                    ambassadors, I must say, but there were also some career ambassadors...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there something that happened in Switzerland,
                        Austria, or some place like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was a very difficult business involving Ron Lauder in Austria and
                    Faith Whittlesey in Switzerland. Both of them political appointees, wanted to
                    have much more in the way of representational funds available to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Faith Whittlesey had been working on the personnel side in the White House before
                    going to Switzerland. She left Switzerland, returned to her job in the White
                    House and then was reappointed back to Switzerland. She went to Switzerland
                    twice. Their idea was to seek contributions from members of their party or their
                    friends, thereby constituting a fund that they could use in various ways for
                    representational activities, in return for which they would invite the donors
                    [to the fund] to dinner parties and other special events in their embassies. It
                    was, in fact, a rather sick idea. They were using the money in the fund in ways
                    which the regulations prohibited an ambassador from spending representational
                    funds. It took quite a while to get at this problem, working with the Legal
                    Adviser [of the Department of State] and also with the Deputy Secretary of
                    State, who was very interested in the subject, too — John Whitehead, an
                    investment banker from New York. He was a good friend for whom I had great
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the White House? Did you find that you were
                        butting heads with the White House, because these were their “boys” or their
                        “girls?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Not to a great extent. I found that the Reagan White House was fairly
                    correct in these matters and quite useful.</p>
                <p>Another function that the Inspector General undertook at that time — and, I
                    imagine, still is — was the investigation of special issues or special problems
                    that came up. For instance, when chiefs of mission were accused of poor
                    performance or misconduct of one type or another, I had several distinguished,
                    retired ambassadors who would come onto the payroll for a short time to go out
                    to do a job of that type. The two [retired ambassadors] who come to mind as
                    being most helpful and most effective were Tony Ross and Bob Sayre, who would
                    take on one of these tasks and do it with great distinction. It was a very
                    delicate matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Let me give you a couple of examples. We had the case of a career
                    ambassador in South America who was accused by Senator Helms' staff and by
                    certain members of the military government in his country of having an “affair”
                    with a lady who was organizing a liberal, anti-regime party, and also of
                    interfering in the political life of the country. One of these two former
                    ambassadors went down there and did really quite an excellent job of reviewing
                    the whole thing, talking to people, investigating the matter, and coming up, I
                    thought, with a very useful report which enabled us to clarify the situation.
                    Senator Helms and his very energetic, although, at times, quite vicious, staff
                    did not want to accept our findings and kept the matter alive.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>We had another case of an ambassador — also an FSO — in an African country who
                    was regarded simply as not performing effectively and of becoming a liability
                    for the administration, because he was not leading his mission and not doing his
                    job. One of my deputies — himself a former ambassador — went out to review that
                    situation, interview members of the staff and individuals who were there, and
                    come up with an analysis which would resolve that situation. These tasks were
                    often done following an approach to me by a regional assistant secretary, who
                    would say, “I've got a real problem which I can't handle in such and such a
                    country. Is there some way that you could send someone out to look into that?”
                    We would do so.</p>
                <p>There was the case of a non-career, politically appointed ambassador in a
                    Scandinavian country who was actually going out and picking up prostitutes in a
                    park of the capital city. There was just a terrible, public scandal, involving
                    drunken behavior as well. The White House was reluctant to make an issue of that
                    matter but did finally agree to get rid of the man when they could base their
                    action on a documented inspection report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for this Scandinavian problem. You
                        would hear about this issue from where? How would something like this come
                        to your attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There would be two usual ways for it [to come to my attention]. One way
                    would be that the [regional] assistant secretary would come by to see me or call
                    me up — or ask me to come by and see him. He would describe what was, to him, a
                    very difficult issue. When you have a case of gross misbehavior by an
                    ambassador, it's very difficult without documentation, particularly if it
                    involves a non-career person. Without real documentation it's very difficult to
                    take action in a case like that. You would be pitting the political party system
                    of the U.S. Government against the professionals. So what would be required
                    would be documentation. The Inspector General would be in a position to document
                    the situation.</p>
                <p>The other way in which it would typically come to light would be through one of
                    our regular inspections. In a different country the inspectors found dreadful
                    malfeasance by a career Foreign Service ambassador, who was using public
                    property for his own ends. He had wasted endless funds on his residence in a
                    perverse fashion. His wife was writing a book, using a Foreign Service secretary
                    and the word processor and copying equipment of the mission which belonged to
                    the government. This ambassador was locked in confrontation with his DCM, who
                    was trying to stand up to him. The inspectors found out about this. We were able
                    to have this man removed, using the evidence accumulated during the inspection
                    and during a subsequent, special visit by a senior Inspector sent there to
                    resolve it.</p>
                <p>I don't think that we should look upon the U.S. Foreign Service or diplomatic
                    system as being a particularly soft or corrupt. It's not that at all. But any
                    large organization of people in government is going to have problems, and the
                    Inspector General is in a good position to resolve some of these problems.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back to where you were going after gross corruption and
                        all of this — and all of us who have been in the “trade” know that this does
                        happen. Power goes to people's heads. Let's go back to the Scandinavian type
                        situation, which has happened other times, too. All of us have our stories.
                        I would think that the Assistant Secretary could call up the Ambassador or
                        get somebody in the White House to call him up and say, “Look, this problem
                        is really causing trouble.” They might tell the offender to lay off the
                        hookers and lay off the booze or he's out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: You might think so, but it just doesn't prove to be that simple a
                    problem, because the behavior comes to people's attention in third person
                    stories, accounts, and rumors. You aren't sure whether the individual has some
                    enemies who are trying to put him down. You don't really know what the facts
                    are. Human beings are very reluctant to call up and dress down other human
                    beings without having a really strong basis for it. The Department of State,
                    including the Secretary of State, is very, very reluctant to go to the President
                    and say, “This, this, and this, and the man you appointed must be fired.” In the
                    case of a political appointee, he's likely to be a personal friend of the
                    President. After all, the ambassador is the President's personal representative.
                    It's very difficult to do in human terms. So the approach which is usually taken
                    is to develop “hard” evidence of the problem, and then to approach the President
                    and the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now if you have a case of this nature, do you, more or
                        less, warn the person that you're coming out to look at the situation, that
                        you've heard various reports, etc? How is it handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: You inform the ambassador that there's a special inspection coming up,
                    that there's a team of inspectors coming out to meet with him. That is an
                    awkward situation when an individual on the staff is accused of peculation —
                    that is, a Budget and Fiscal Officer is alleged to have been pocketing funds, or
                    something of that kind. Then it really amounts to a criminal investigation,
                    which is done by special investigators from the Office of the Inspector General.
                    That's a difficult situation, too, which must be handled with great delicacy.
                    Usually, only the chief of mission is informed of what the purpose of the
                    special investigation is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression regarding teams which you sent
                        out on allegations of criminal offenses? Did you find that, usually, before
                        you sent out a team, there really was something there, or were you getting
                        involved in “backbiting” within the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>HARROP: My experience was that, “where there was smoke, there was, in fact, at
                    least some fire.” You know, we have a “hot line.” People would call up or
                    volunteer an account to an inspector of gross misbehavior on the part of some
                    colleague. You would begin with a considerable skepticism, but I would say that,
                    in four times out of five, there was something to it — not always as marked a
                    version as had been reported, because often the reports were vindictive.
                    Usually, there was some basis. It was an unusual case — certainly, as I say, not
                    more than one out of five, when there was simply no truth in the allegations.
                    People do not lightly accuse others to the Inspector General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the more mundane side, I can recall going through
                        various phases in the Foreign Service. I came into the Service in 1955. The
                        inspectors would come around. They'd only see you for a short time, but you
                        had the feeling that their report carried great weight. Then, toward the end
                        of my career, I had the feeling that the inspectors' report did not carry as
                        much weight. I'm talking about the personnel field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: For a long time we stopped doing inspectors' performance evaluations of
                    individuals in the Foreign Service on the ground, quite specifically, that it
                    was really not appropriate for an inspector, on the basis of two or three weeks
                    at post and one or two interviews with an individual, to do a performance
                    evaluation. The reason that they had had such weight in the past was that
                    performance review boards had become fatigued with reading overly praising and
                    overly homogeneous reports. The inspectors' reports tended to be more incisive
                    and more curt and blunt than the normal, supervisors' reports. They were
                    treasured — this I know from much experience — by the review boards. We stopped
                    doing that because it just didn't seem quite appropriate.</p>
                <p>Then, while I was Inspector General, we went back to something that had been done
                    in the past, which was a special review of the performance of the ambassador and
                    the deputy chief of mission, on the ground that the inspector could get a sense
                    of the overall leadership — policy and substantive leadership and management
                    ability — of the top people in a mission, even during a relatively short time
                    there. After all, the work done by these people was not being observed by
                    supervisors on the spot. It was a way, we felt, in which we could have a major
                    input. In fact, I think that has worked pretty well, particularly since the
                    inspectors, to a greater extent than the assistant secretary, are looking at
                    executive and management performance — and not only the policy performance. In
                    the Foreign Service generally we've tended to focus on policy. It still is the
                    case that people are recognized, appointed, and promoted basically for foreign
                    policy performance, despite a lot of lip service paid to the management
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could make a judgment on a regular Foreign Service
                        Officer who was looking for another assignment as ambassador, so this would
                        have some weight. But what about a political appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>HARROP: We did these appraisals, and I think that, to the extent that there is
                    rationality in the political appointment of ambassadors, I would hope it would
                    have some effect. I don't know. Certainly, the Secretary of State would take a
                    look at [the appraisal of the performance of a political ambassador], if there
                    were a question of reappointing him or her to a another, similar position. This
                    would be one part of the file, but I would not have any illusions that this
                    would be the major consideration.</p>
                <p>Probably, the main thing that I began to focus my attention on as Inspector
                    General was a complete reorganization of the Inspector General's job. I was
                    helped tremendously by two very capable deputies who were old friends of mine:
                    one was Bill Edmondson, the former Ambassador to South Africa, a man of sober,
                    responsible judgment and unshakable integrity and dedication — just an excellent
                    person; and by Lannon Walker, whom I had succeeded as Chairman of AFSA a few
                    years before, a man of great dynamism, personal force and creativity. I think
                    that, together, we were able to form an unusually effective team. We reorganized
                    the entire manner in which the Inspector General's office worked and inspections
                    were done. We tried to build up the investigative and auditing sides, which had
                    been criticized, and with reason. I was really quite pleased with our efforts.
                    We drew up a new manual for the Inspector General's office and for
                    inspectors.</p>
                <p>I think it went pretty well. However, I was increasingly forced to spend my time
                    in what you would have to describe as a “defensive operation” against Senator
                    Helms, who became determined to destroy the institution of the Inspector General
                    of the Foreign Service. As part of his relentless campaign against career
                    Foreign Service professionals, he tried to prevent, as he put it, the Foreign
                    Service from inspecting itself. One technique was an amendment to legislation,
                    usually to the Department of State authorization act, in the typical way in
                    which Senator Helms and his very effective and competent staff operated. The
                    amendment would be introduced on the floor of the Senate, without any hearings
                    or discussion of the issues in the committee. With a handful of Senators present
                    for a routine bill, a Helms amendment would go through with just a voice vote.
                    Ultimately, he was able to eliminate the language in the Foreign Service Act
                    which was the legislative basis for the Inspector General function in the
                    Department of State and to bring the Department's Inspector General system under
                    the legislation for inspectors general in other parts of government. His
                    amendment included a clause that the Inspector General could not be a Foreign
                    Service Officer — he had to be someone from outside the service. The Civil
                    Service can inspect the Civil Service, but the Foreign Service can not inspect
                    the Foreign Service. So I was the last Foreign Service Officer to serve as
                    Inspector General.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very important thing to understand — the
                        political process of the Foreign Service. You had to deal with this
                        intimately. What was your evaluation of the motivation of Senator Helms and
                        also of his staff in this almost “go for the jugular” campaign against the
                        Foreign Service? What caused it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think that there's a deep resentment of self-contained aspect of the
                    Foreign Service — its pragmatism, really. The Senator has a very strong,
                    ideological underpinning for his approach to the world. He resents the way in
                    which the Foreign Service thinks of the national interest in a highly pragmatic
                    way, without the beacon of ideology that he has. He seems to loathe the Foreign
                    Service professional's view of American interests overseas as a continuing
                    reality not affected by the alteration of political parties at home. Somehow, he
                    has built that up into a crusade. He has a hatred for the Foreign Service which
                    is very hard to understand in rational terms. I think that part of his staff
                    [feels] a plain, personal hatred. The Senator tends to employ disaffected
                    Foreign Service Officers or people that have been selected out of the Foreign
                    Service, who failed to reach career status, but still are quite brilliant
                    people. There's a sense of crusade, it seemed to me an ill or abnormal
                    crusade.</p>
                <p>Senator Helms has taken his feelings to the point of working to deny to the
                    Foreign Service by law benefits which officers of the Civil Service or the armed
                    forces receive. Military officers who are rotated in and out of Washington are
                    exempted from paying District of Columbia income taxes if they have residence in
                    a state. Senator Helms managed to have legislation passed which provides that
                    Foreign Service Officers in the same circumstances, as presidential appointees,
                    are subject to District of Columbia income tax. Meanwhile, by law, members of
                    Congress and their staffs are thought of as being residents of their states, as
                    are personnel of the Armed Forces, and are not subject to District income tax.
                    The Foreign Service has been singled out by name to receive discriminatory
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>Senator Helms is a very effective parliamentarian, an experienced and astute
                    member of the Senate. He knows his work and how to get things done in the
                    Senate. With the peculiar hostile agenda he has had, this has caused great
                    difficulties for the American Foreign Service. For instance, if he has the
                    impression that a particular career officer does not approve of a policy line he
                    supports, the Senator will really go after him personally. This came up most
                    often in connection with Central and South America, a focus of the Senator's
                    interest because he was chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations
                    Subcommittee for that area at the time of which we are speaking. He would insist
                    that there be a special investigation or inspection done of an Embassy he
                    believed varied from his policy position. He would not accept the result of
                    special investigations, which I handled, of certain career officers in Central
                    and South America. I think that one of the reasons why he was going after me and
                    the notion of a Foreign Service Officer as Inspector General was that he wanted
                    to find someone a little more malleable to work with. I don't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, within the Department of State, that you
                        were being told, “Watch out for this guy”? After all, you were looking
                        forward to a future career, and this man was going to be sitting on the
                        Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Were you getting the advice from people,
                        “Play it carefully” with this guy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No. I was never cautioned by the Secretary of State or anyone else in the
                    Department of State in that way. On one or two occasions, I felt the Department
                    had trimmed its sails a little because of the power of the man. People were
                    afraid for the sake of our budget, or something of that kind. In my opinion on
                    several occasions, people might have stood up to him with greater determination
                    than they did. But I did not feel a lack of support in that regard. The Senator
                    operates in a very unusual fashion. For instance, I've had six presidential
                    appointments and six Senate confirmations. On two occasions he went all out
                    against me, and I had a struggle. I was delayed for many months before going to
                    Zaire and had a really horrendous time being confirmed by the Senate. On another
                    occasion, to Guinea, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, Mike
                    Mansfield and Hugh Scott, who did not know me personally, stood up for me on the
                    Senate floor against Senator Helms as a matter of Senate procedural principle,
                    before I could be confirmed. On the other four occasions he simply was not heard
                    from — as if he was not interested. On some of these four occasions my
                    appointment was to a position which, you would have supposed, would be of
                    greater concern to him. His erratic performance and the mean behavior of his
                    staff were among the more difficult aspects of dealing with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a Senator who has a powerful
                        position. At the same time did you find that there were others [in the
                        Senate] whom you could seek out — “allies” is the wrong term, but rather
                        “supporters” — who understood what you were after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Sure. There are people in Congress who have an understanding of the
                    Foreign Service — or, in this case, my point of view on things. They would lend
                    a sympathetic ear. However, I guess that what happens is that Senator Helms is
                    prepared to press his case to the hilt, to make a major issue of matters
                    affecting a single Foreign Service Officer's career or over some clause in the
                    Foreign Service Act which simply isn't that important to any other member of the
                    Senate. Because he makes the issue so important to himself personally, the
                    others are not interested in using up too much of their political capital to
                    counter his idiosyncratic behavior. That's one reason that he's so remarkably
                    successful. He's been able to destroy a number of Foreign Service careers. Other
                    Senators just don't want to go to bat over such ancillary issues, and they also
                    seem to fear his volatility, viciousness, and competence.</p>
                <p>[Senator Helms'] position, articulated quite frankly, was that the other
                    inspectors general could be Civil Service officers — civil service people can
                    inspect and audit other civil service people, but Foreign Service people cannot
                    inspect or audit other Foreign Service people, because they're likely to be
                    “tainted” and likely to be more “reachable” by their own colleagues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the Inspector General experience, you were
                        getting reports in from all over. Did you get any feeling about the relative
                        efficiency and strengths of the various bureaus [in the Department] at that
                        time? This was a chance to review the whole system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, there was a great variation in the quality of leadership in
                    different bureaus. There has always been, in the Foreign Service and in the
                    Department of State, an odd dichotomy between administration, management,
                    budget, and personnel questions on the one hand, and policy questions on the
                    other. The institution has been far more successful in policy matters than it
                    has been on the management side. The Inspector General is concerned with the
                    management. He doesn't intervene in policy matters, although his inspectors do
                    try to take a look to see that the policy being pursued is appropriate and
                    coherent and makes sense. If they feel that there is a problem there, they will
                    invite attention to it by the leadership of the Department. But that's a more
                    unusual matter than problems on the administrative side.</p>
                <p>There are great variations among assistant secretaries of state and their staffs
                    in how they deploy their resources, how well they manage their operations, how
                    well they use their money effectively, or how much time they're willing to
                    devote to trying to obtain more resources, if that's required, from the
                    Administration and from Congress. At present, in my judgment, the ability of the
                    Foreign Service to protect and advance American national interests overseas is
                    in doubt because appropriations have declined over the past 15 years below the
                    “red line”. No more easy cuts are possible, and operations — policy operations —
                    are suffering.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, in our system — historically and still at present — the policy
                    side is the only one that catches the attention of the President and the
                    Secretary of State. Performance on the policy side is more likely to be rewarded
                    or punished than is performance on the managerial side — which, I think, should
                    have more weight. As I mentioned, Secretary of State George Shultz made a
                    tremendous effort to focus attention on management. Often, in recent years,
                    there has been rhetoric about the need to have greater attention paid to that
                    aspect, but the rhetoric has seemed to be just that.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Something else that the Inspector General does which, I think, is useful, is to
                    seek innovative, systemic improvement. The notion of the “small post” came out
                    of the Inspector General's office. We are into an excruciatingly difficult
                    budget situation. It gets worse every year and is now reaching the stage of a
                    real, national crisis in terms of budget allocations for the management of
                    foreign policy. It has been building over the last generation. With this crisis
                    in resources to manage and implement foreign policy, inspectors have been trying
                    to identify savings that could be made in specific areas, positions that could
                    be deleted, and functions and posts that could be abolished altogether. Out of
                    all of this work we developed the notion of the “small Embassy” which would have
                    a much narrower set of responsibilities and would be exempted from a number of
                    things which other embassies are required to do. It would have a staff of three
                    or four people, instead of 30 or 40, and would, we would hope, keep the American
                    flag flying without having to spend as much money as would otherwise be
                    necessary. This concept was developed in the Inspector General's office.</p>
                <p>We would also recommend consolidations of bureaus or other reorganization of the
                    Department of State. In a bureaucratic system such change is so difficult that
                    people hesitate to take it on. The power of an entrenched bureaucracy is so
                    great. We've just seen an example in the last few months of 1993 when Vice
                    President Gore's committee recommended that the different segments of the law
                    enforcement, drug enforcement, and firearms operations be consolidated into the
                    FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and that different branches of the
                    Department of Justice should be merged to achieve major budgetary savings and to
                    improve efficiency. It was literally not possible for the Attorney General to do
                    this because of the defensive breastworks set up by the bureaucracies and the
                    Congressional committees from which they depended.</p>
                <p>This was a very hard problem to take on, but we tried it a number of times. The
                    Department of State could benefit from real reorganization, and some of it is
                    now going on, to the credit of the present leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>One thing that particularly galled me, I must say — and still does — was the cost
                    of the “imperial travel” of the Secretary of State. It had become a scandal 15
                    years ago and is more of a scandal now — because of declining budgets — than it
                    was then. We did a special inspection of the travel of the Secretary. I reported
                    on conclusions to Secretary Shultz. The expenditure of tens or scores of
                    thousands of dollars for the advance teams was not justified, nor were the scale
                    of special security provisions and the autonomous communications arrangements
                    made for the Secretary's visit even if he was living in a hotel next door to the
                    Embassy and could easily use Embassy facilities. I said that it was ridiculous
                    to have a whole jet aircraft full of people, including hangers on and what not.
                    I was unable to get him to agree, although he certainly understood. In fact,
                    when the administration changed recently, I called up the new Executive
                    Secretary of the Department. The Secretary happened to be coming out on his
                    first trip overseas to Tel Aviv, where I was Ambassador at the time. I said,
                    “Look, you and I know this situation. Here's your chance to strike a blow for
                    the United States and for the taxpayer. Why don't you try to organize this first
                    visit in a new fashion? You could probably save $100,000 on this three-day
                    trip.” He wasn't able to do it. I wasn't surprised, because these procedures
                    have an inertia which only determined energy can overcome. It takes a brutal
                    approach to stop it.</p>
                <p>Secretary Shultz was very interested in the inspection business. He's an
                    inner-directed and, I would say, a “reserved” man. I would go to him, after
                    doing an inspection of a bureau or a mission or a series of missions overseas.
                    This would have been one example — his own travel budget. I would make a report
                    to him about the findings of the inspectors and how matters could be improved.
                    He would ask a number of intelligent questions. His attention would clearly be
                    focused on the issues involved, and his interest would be there. At the end of
                    the presentation I would say, “So, to recapitulate, Mr. Secretary, the problems
                    are such and such, the actions which we must take to resolve or improve this
                    situation are A, B, C, D, and E, and I urge that you do that. Here it all is in
                    writing.” He would say, “Bill, thank you very much, indeed.” I would go back to
                    my office and I would never know if I had moved him or if he was going to do it
                    at all. Sometimes the actions would be taken and sometimes they would not be
                    taken. But he was hardly a person who carried his ideas or his heart on his
                    sleeve. So it was a bit frustrating not to have more responsiveness from a man
                    for whom I had tremendous respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the last Foreign Service Officer to serve as
                        Inspector General. Was it sort of cut out from under you or how did this
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Senator Helms succeeded in changing the legislative basis of the
                    Inspector General and his office. He was brought under the Inspector General Act
                    and out of the Foreign Service Act: the Inspector General function in the
                    Foreign Service Act was simply replaced by a classic civil service operation.
                    Now, in fact, there is still an Office of the Inspector General, but the

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Sherman Funk. He was Inspector General of the Department of Commerce and
                    now he has come to the Department of State. I think that he is doing a good job
                    there, although the philosophy is somewhat different. I guess my greatest
                    grievance with Sherman is over the budget and resources that he's allocating. He
                    has multiplied by at least three times the budget and the staff that I had. He
                    has vastly expanded the operation in a way which I personally do not believe was
                    necessary. I think that there's too much money being spent on it now. However, I
                    would also say that he has shown a great deal of courage and integrity in the
                    tasks and the jobs that he has taken on. He's done a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he has come “head to head” with the White House on a
                        number of occasions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, he's shown courage, and I have great respect for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might as well continue this look at the inspection
                        function, because you did serve there for some years and for a considerable
                        time thereafter. I've had the impression that, partly because you had such a
                        big staff, you had to justify it by finding cases of “malfeasance,” and so
                        forth, to show that you were doing something. Did you find that the new
                        inspection corps, with much more emphasis on what is termed “We gotcha” type
                        of things...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I don't think so. It was always a preoccupation of ours that we not do
                    “We gotcha” types of things, although an individual inspector — even some of our
                    Foreign Service Officers, career people who were assigned to be inspectors —
                    would develop that mentality to some extent. I mean, you're out inspecting and
                    you're looking for problems and trying to correct them. That is a human
                    tendency, I think. But I don't believe that that ever was a big problem, despite
                    the fact that people being inspected thought it was. I don't think it is a
                    problem now. I don't think that the new operation is going in that direction in
                    particular. I think that they're behaving responsibly and don't feel the need to
                    justify their operations by finding problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the other side? I speak from an historian's
                        point of view. One of the greatest things that happened when we turned to a
                        professional inspection corps in 1906 was the creation of an Inspectorate
                        for consular operations, as it was called. [People assigned to it] were
                        called “Consuls General at Large.” There were five of them, and they
                        performed inspections. It drew the service together, and it was designed
                        mainly to unify and to make sure that people were doing things correctly and
                        also understood what other people were doing. What about that function now?
                        Do you feel that the inspection is looking at ways of improving performance
                        and helping the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>HARROP: Absolutely. I think that's still being done. Mr. Funk came in with the
                    feeling that he had a particular mission from the Congress to reorganize and, I
                    think, to make the Inspector General's function less of a specifically Foreign
                    Service operation and more of a typical, federal government OIG function.
                    However, I believe that he appreciated very quickly that the inspection and
                    improvement of operations — the non-confrontational inspection — were, in
                    themselves, very worthwhile. He's retained this concept and he's retained
                    Foreign Service Officers to do Foreign Service inspections, I think to the
                    dismay of Senator Helms, who tried very hard to get that abolished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then? You left [the position of Inspector
                        General] in, what, 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, it went through a stage. During my last year as Inspector General I
                    was called the “Program Inspector General,” as they were beginning to organize
                    the office under Sherman Funk. We had two inspection systems for a short time,
                    which was obviously not going to work. Deputy Secretary John Whitehead was
                    involved and helpful in these matters.</p>
                <p>I can recall a meeting in Mr. Whitehead's office with Ron Spiers, Under Secretary
                    for Management; George Vest, the Director General [of the Foreign Service]; and
                    Nick Platt, who was then the Executive Secretary of the Department of State. We
                    were faced with this incomplete legislation which created the position of
                    “Program Inspector General” and the new office of a non-Foreign Service
                    Inspector General, who was clearly to have the stronger, legislative basis for
                    operations.</p>
                <p>At this meeting Mr. Whitehead did not take a strong position. He acted more as a
                    referee, letting the others discuss the matter. My Foreign Service colleagues
                    said that we had to hang on, we had to retain the Foreign Service inspections,
                    because our system really needed that function. They argued that we really had
                    to insist upon maintaining this function despite Senator Helms. I said, “No, we
                    shouldn't. We've lost the battle, and we're better off trying to work with the
                    new Inspector General, to see that the things we believe important for policy
                    making and for keeping our system effective are incorporated into his operations
                    — than for me to compete with him.” My position proved more realistic, because
                    the handwriting was on the wall. Things were going in that direction. We had a
                    real donnybrook over how we should respond. Ultimately, I did phase out my
                    operation, as Sherman Funk built his operation up. He did, in fact, incorporate
                    the best features of the Foreign Service inspection system. So I think, by and
                    large, the Department of State, despite Senator Helms' personal agenda and
                    efforts, has probably been helped by the whole exercise.</p>

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HARROP: John Hemenway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hemenway and Senator Helms. You butted heads with these
                        two “H's.” It is sort of unusual, in a relatively small organization, to
                        have people both inside and outside of it — we're talking about both Helms
                        and Hemenway — almost trying to destroy the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: But, you see, John Hemenway had been inside, but he had been selected out
                    of the Foreign Service, for whatever reasons. I take no position on the merits
                    of his selection out. It's not easy to get selected out of the Foreign Service,
                    virtually impossible to arrange for the selection out of a Foreign Service
                    Officer through manipulation. I would start from the premise that if someone who
                    has been selected out of the Foreign Service there was probably good reason for
                    the service to have dropped him. Hemenway understandably became very hostile
                    after having been selected out, as were some of these people who, as I say,
                    worked on Helms' staff. They were also disaffected Foreign Service Officers. He
                    was in the same category. He was not an “inside” man. He came back, through a
                    remarkable fluke, and a divided election, as Chairman of the American Foreign
                    Service Association, and was both controversial and destructive. Finally, he had
                    to be formally recalled in a special election of AFSA members. It was a very sad
                    occurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it is interesting that the Foreign Service...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Although the term “elitist” is a bad term and “politically incorrect” at
                    the present time, the Foreign Service is, in fact, and has been for generations,
                    an “elitist” or “elite” organization of very carefully selected people. People
                    who are well educated, ambitious, and have a certain image of their country and
                    their nation do aspire to get into the Foreign Service. They work hard to pass
                    this difficult examination and to get into this career, as in any other
                    prestigious organization, whether it's the U.S. Marine Corps, an “Inspecteur de
                    Finances” in France, or the Coldstream Guards. That's the way it works. By the
                    same token, there's almost bound to be a certain resentment of this, and there
                    will be people trying to tear down any group which has an elitist reputation and
                    the kind of arrogance which, I'm sorry to say, comes with it. So I don't think
                    that it would be surprising that the Foreign Service would be subjected to these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other question occurs to me on this. What about during
                        your time [as Inspector General], did you get involved in matters of women
                        and minorities, meaning Blacks, or African Americans, and Hispanics?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, that would always be an element in inspections. In fact, we had
                    several special inspections or investigative inspections of allegations of
                    sexual harassment or of racism at overseas missions. These are always very
                    difficult matters to address.</p>
                <p>There was one case in Warsaw, as I recall, a very difficult problem — an
                    allegation of sexual discrimination. However, I guess I worked more on that when
                    I was Chairman of AFSA than I did when I was Inspector General, because of the
                    efforts to organize the women, particularly in the Foreign Service, in an effort
                    to improve their role. The challenge of improving equality in a system has to be
                    shared by everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after you went through this interim stage?
                        Did your appointment as Ambassador to Zaire come up at that point, was there
                        an intervening period, or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was during that intervening time. I don't think that the appointment
                    to Zaire was particularly surprising. It was logical for me, since I'd served in
                    Zaire before and had worked in that area of the world a good deal. My
                    confirmation for that position was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because of Senator Helms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Not entirely. It was partly Helms and partly the “Left” side of Congress,
                    which was concerned about our support for Jonas Savimbi in Angola. It was, I
                    think, well known that that support was implemented through the mission in
                    Kinshasa [Zaire]. So it was one of those situations in which members of Congress
                    attempted to use the confirmation process to make some policy points or to try
                    to affect policy. This was a lever available to Senators, as so often
                    happens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? Let's take this case. Here you are.
                        You're not responsible for this policy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, it's an interesting matter, and I can tell you quite specifically
                    how, in this case, it played out. There are two select intelligence committees,
                    in the Senate and in the House. There are the Foreign Affairs Relations and
                    Armed Services Forces committees in the two houses. Some of the Senators on the
                    Foreign Relations Committee, and more particularly their staffs on the
                    Democratic side, the side opposed to our covert operations in Angola, resented
                    the fact that they were not fully informed by the Intelligence Committee as to
                    what was going on there. So during my hearing for confirmation as Ambassador to
                    Zaire they would ask me questions about the covert operations in Angola and try
                    to insist that I reply.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain more fully, since historians might not
                        fully understand what the issue was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, the MPLA [Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government, the
                    communist government of Angola, was opposed by an insurgent group, UNITA
                    [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], under a man named Jonas
                    Savimbi. A war between these two organizations had been going on many years. In
                    fact, as we talk today, in 1993, this confrontation still continues. Savimbi has
                    disappointed many of his acquaintances and people who respected him by not
                    accepting the results of the elections held in Angola. Anyway, just as the
                    Soviet Union and Cuba strongly backed the MPLA government — in fact, the Cubans
                    put substantial forces into Angola — the United States had been covertly
                    supporting Savimbi in his efforts to oppose that communist government. This had
                    been going on for some time, and it was a matter of deep controversy within the
                    American political system as well. A classic Cold War confrontation in Africa.
                    As I was suggesting, my confirmation hearing on appointment as Ambassador to
                    Zaire began to turn somewhat less on my experience, credentials, and competence
                    to do the job, than on issues of substance. Our policy itself became directly
                    injected into the confirmation process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then how did you answer and deal with this question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, what I tried to do in this case was to turn it back to the policy
                    partisans themselves. I tried to get the Intelligence Committee people to deal
                    directly with the Foreign Relations Committee people, rather than expecting me
                    to form a bridge between them. It worked to a fairly good extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Helms take any stand on this particular issue or was
                        it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: On that issue Helms did not, although he did oppose me because he took
                    strong issue with some of the things I had done as Inspector General, which he
                    resented, particularly on the Latin American matters which I mentioned before.
                    He was after me on those grounds and put me “on hold” for many months. However,
                    he was not concerned about covert operations. In fact, Senator Helms was quite
                    comfortable with the support given to Jonas Savimbi in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you were put “on hold,” what does a senior
                        Foreign Service Officer do when he or she is put “on hold” — with particular
                        reference to your case?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, you can spend a long season just trying to defend your case,
                    preparing your testimony, trying to answer questions from the Senate, and
                    meanwhile preparing for what you hope will be your new job. It can go on for
                    many months, and meanwhile our posts are not properly staffed and our foreign
                    policy is not properly led or conducted because of the delays in getting a chief
                    of mission to the field. When an Ambassador appears before the Foreign Relations
                    Committee, he or she is able to find out pretty quickly if there is going to be
                    a problem, because three times out of four Senator Helms will say, “We have a
                    few more questions in writing which we would like to ask subsequently.” Then,
                    the next day, the Department will receive perhaps five, it may be 35, it may be
                    75 questions. These must all be replied to. So then you spend a long time,
                    working with the bureau and working by yourself to prepare answers to all of
                    these detailed questions. On some occasions these questions may be frivolous.
                    Usually, they're meticulous, substantive questions. When you get those answers
                    in, which could take several weeks, depending on the substance involved, often
                    after a suitable period of time they are replaced by another series of, say, 22
                    or 43 questions which must be answered. This is the technique which is used, and
                    the Senator's staff does it masterfully. And then Senator Helms will say, “Well,
                    there is no way in which we can report out this candidate, when we still have a
                    number of questions which have not been answered, to our satisfaction. So this
                    process must be worked out.” And then, when he has no more questions, he may
                    simply, as a matter of Senatorial privilege, say, “I prefer not to have this
                    come up.” And he can hold it up. One colleague, Richard Viets, had his career
                    ended in this way by Senator Helms refusing ever to allow a vote to come about.
                    It reached the point where either Viets himself or the White House would have to
                    withdraw his nomination, his own candidacy, or our foreign policy would just not
                    be conducted, American interests would suffer because there was no ambassador at
                    the post.</p>
                <p>I was held up at the same time, interestingly enough, as the officer who was
                    later to be my successor in Zaire, Melissa Wells, who is now Under Secretary
                    General of the United Nations. She was scheduled to go to Mozambique as I was
                    going to Zaire in 1987. Senator Helms had a particular animosity toward Mrs.
                    Wells. She had earlier worked in the United Nations Development Program and in
                    other places and had taken positions which he regarded as being “liberal” or
                    “incorrect.” So he held her up for several months longer than he held me up. She
                    had a very hard time being confirmed, although only one Senator out of the 100
                    opposed her. Finally, she was able, by her own determination and belated support
                    from the Executive Branch, to wait Senator Helms out and blast through to a vote
                    which was, of course, favorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, the head of the Foreign Relations Committee is
                        a former Foreign Service Officer, Senator Claiborne Pell. At least in the
                        Senate the Republicans were in the minority during all of this time. Was it
                        a matter of...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>HARROP: I guess that there are four reasons, really, why Senator Helms is able to
                    do this. He is very competent, very tough, very intelligent, and very
                    knowledgeable about the process of the Senate. He is a capable and determined
                    man. Secondly, he plays artfully upon the individual rights and privileges of
                    the individual Senator as a member of the “Club.” The other members of the
                    Senate do not like to put down one of their own in an ad hominem way. You know,
                    there have been rare historical events such as the political demise of Senator
                    Joseph McCarthy, rejected finally by his peers. This happens very unusually in
                    the Senate. Thirdly, it depends on the strength and leadership of the chairman
                    of the committee. I'm sorry to say that Senator Pell has not shown great
                    leadership, toughness, or determination in running the committee. Senator Helms
                    could not necessarily have succeeded, and might not have, with a strong
                    chairman. Senator Helms had a relatively “inert” Committee leadership to work
                    with. Then, lastly, there is the reluctance of the Executive Branch to put its
                    weight behind issues of this kind, to do what might be seen by many in the
                    Senate, otherwise out of patience with Senator Helms, as interfering in Senate
                    business. The Executive Branch is reluctant to take risks with the Senate.
                    Senator Helms is able to manipulate all of these factors in a quite brilliant
                    fashion and to persevere, because he cares deeply about issues which are not on
                    the top of anybody else's agenda. He can prevail in that fashion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Zaire?</hi>
                </p>

                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>HARROP: The economy was declining. It had not been doing well for a long time,
                    under the failing leadership of President Mobutu. The copper market was weak at
                    the time, copper being the major foreign exchange resource of Zaire. This was
                    not helpful. Human rights problems were very serious in Zaire, as they had been
                    for a generation. The Angolan insurgency was continuing. It was very active, and
                    there was a major level of American support for one of the protagonists — Jonas
                    Savimbi and his UNITA. We had a substantial development assistance program in
                    Zaire. We had a large mission, 150 people, of whom the largest single component
                    was AID people. We had a major Peace Corps presence. It had come down from 300
                    to just under 200 volunteers because of a typical confrontation with President
                    Mobutu, who had chosen to use the Peace Corps as a bargaining chip. It was a
                    country with a deteriorating infrastructure. Zaire potentially could be
                    extremely rich, since it has the most extensive natural resources. About 15-16
                    percent of the world's hydroelectric power potential is in the Zaire (Congo)
                    River. There is excellent rainfall; excellent arable land; major mineral
                    resources, including 65 percent of the world's industrial diamonds, as well as
                    gem diamonds; 8 percent of the world's copper; 65 percent of the world's cobalt.
                    There is enough oil for the country to be self-sufficient. It has wonderful,
                    natural communications through the waterways. You could say that it is at the
                    same time a country of breathtaking potential and one that is on its back,
                    economically. It was then (and is even more now) in pitiful condition.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: General Mobutu dominated the politics of Zaire. There were always efforts
                    — part ethnically and part ideologically based — to oppose him, to organize a
                    more democratic system, or to assemble an opposition. However, by his genius for
                    ethnic manipulation and utilization of the military he was able to contain the
                    situation pretty well. But conditions — both absolutely and from his point of
                    view — were troublesome and getting worse.</p>

                        that, given the right leadership, could actually do something or were we

                <p>HARROP: The people of Zaire, as a group, are remarkably docile. This is an odd
                    thing to say about the political situation, I suppose. However, the Zairians
                    seem willing to absorb all kinds of abuse and hardship. They are essentially
                    peaceful people. Mobutu has exploited these qualities to a fare thee well. They
                    have tolerated such privation, maladministration, and selfish exploitation from
                    him without rising up that it's become a habit. Zaire may be one of the worse
                    examples of this phenomenon in Africa, although I would not say much the worst.
                    In Nigeria, Kenya, or other major countries, corruption has become a cultural
                    reality — political power corruption as well as money corruption. It seems
                    difficult to develop a decent regime, a true opposition, or a sense of public
                    spirit or national consciousness that would stand up to cynical, greedy
                    leadership. This is because the opponents to the regime, unhappily, seem to
                    become, over time, more motivated to get their hands on the levers of power,
                    money, and spoils than to better the welfare of their fellow countrymen. This is
                    a sad African reality, to what extent created by the failures of colonialism I
                    am not sure.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there groups within Zaire that one would look to —
                        perhaps the entrepreneurial class? I'm not an African expert but I've heard
                        about the Ibo's of Nigeria and people in the Ivory Coast. There are certain
                        groups...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It is true that there are ethnic groups in much of Africa which are
                    thought of as being more entrepreneurial and more naturally adept at business or
                    trade and commerce than others. One particular group or tribe from the central
                    southern area of Zaire, the Kasai Baluba, in fact, have been the heart of the
                    opposition to Mobutu. A man named Tshisekedi, a leader of the Baluba people and
                    a very courageous man, openly opposed Mobutu and was in and out of jail, over
                    and over again. He tried to run against Mobutu and tried to arrange for
                    elections. He actually acted as a prime minister for a time, during the past two
                    years and is thus, again now. But he also is seen by Zairians generally, sadly
                    enough, more as a Baluba than as a national leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Zairian Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>HARROP: The Army is an implement which is used very much by Mobutu, himself a
                    former Army officer and still commander-in-chief of the Army. He is an Army
                    general as well as president of the country. He has shown as much skill in
                    managing the Army as he has in managing ethnic politics. The two are combined,
                    really. The principal officers of the Army tend to be from his own ethnic group,
                    as do the heads of the intelligence system, the judiciary, the gendarmerie, and
                    other major leaders. Despite difficulty in assembling enough pay for the
                    military, they are the first in line when resources are available. He is able to
                    keep their loyalty, more or less. He has problems with military units from time
                    to time in different regions, but I think that his success, despite all odds,
                    and his staying power over the last few years have certainly been due, as much
                    as anything else, to his use of the military and their undoubted loyalty to
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were going out there in January, 1988? Particularly
                        with Senator Helms to delay your departure, you had plenty of time to hone
                        our policy toward Zaire. What did you go out with? What were American
                        interests and what were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We had a number of interests. The Cold War was still a major determinant,
                    spoken or unspoken, of our policy there. I think that, looking back, historians
                    are going to say, “How could the United States have been wedded to such a
                    dictator for so long because there was a confrontation with the Soviet Union, a
                    consideration which, in the end, proved specious?” But that was the situation.
                    We did feel that he [Mobutu] was very useful. I say that he was a genius at
                    manipulating the ethnic, military, and regional politics of his country. He was
                    also a genius at manipulating the United States of America. Operating between
                    and among the United States, France, and Belgium, and between and among the
                    [U.S.] National Security Council, the Department of State, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense, he showed extraordinary
                    political astuteness.</p>
                <p>If we needed African support or help on issues before the UN, General Mobutu was
                    always there. Our relationship was by no means just a one-way street. For
                    instance, if there were a vote in the Security Council about the exclusion of
                    Israel from some body, or if we needed support in the Security Council to do
                    with Korea, Puerto Rico, or whatever the classic issues of the day were, we
                    could always count on President Mobutu to come, front and center, to cast
                    Zaire's vote in favor of the American position. This comportment tends to
                    develop a certain loyalty on the part of American administrations.</p>
                <p>I was instructed to and did work hard on human rights issues, forever going in
                    and complaining about people being in jail. We actually went to visit Zairian
                    political detainees in jail on several occasions, a gross violation, I suppose,
                    of diplomatic norms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would these be Zairians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>HARROP: Zairian citizens, yes — the opposition people who were incarcerated,
                    beaten, mistreated, and all the rest. It was all true. It was a bad situation.
                    We spent a good deal of time on that.</p>
                <p>Then we were also interested in economic development and in the welfare of the
                    Zairian people, and a large part of my day as Ambassador was spent supporting
                    World Bank and IMF recommendations, pressing to free the economy.</p>
                <p>However, as far as Mobutu was concerned, one of the main sources of leverage
                    which he so cleverly used with the United States was cooperation on the Angola
                    situation, which had become important to us in Cold War and political terms. It
                    was essential for us to have access to Angola. And Zaire has a border with
                    Angola over 1,000 miles long. Mobutu fully cooperated with the United States on
                    that issue, at some little risk to his own country. That was another matter on
                    which he was able to nurture his relationship with us. So there were a lot of
                    reasons why the United States embraced this extraordinary, authoritarian,
                    selfish, dictator. But these were the facts and that was the way we
                    operated.</p>
                <p>My own relationship with him was difficult. I was forever engaged in applying
                    pressure on him to improve his record on human rights and the management of the
                    Zairian economy. I regularly pressed him to accede to recommendations on the
                    reform of the Zairian economy made by the International Monetary Fund, the OECD
                    [Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development], and ourselves, in order
                    to justify a continuation of economic support. These issues were not easy to
                    handle, and the need to raise them regularly made the Ambassador's role in Zaire
                    a very hard one. I was in repeated confrontation with President Mobutu at the
                    same time that the United States Ambassador was probably the most important
                    foreigner with whom he dealt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your evaluation of him? Was there somebody behind
                        him, such as an advisor or advisors, or was he pretty much a one-man
                        show?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There were certainly advisors with him — usually closely related ethnic
                    brothers or colleagues. However, he was by far the predominant person. He had
                    been in charge of the country since I had been there before, in 1965, when he
                    acceded to power. He's been in power ever since. The period we have been
                    discussing began in 1988 when he had been top dog already for about 23 years. He
                    had learned a great deal about the role of a leader. He operated as a
                    traditional, tribal chief of the whole country, as well as a political
                    president. He abused the country's treasury mercilessly to obtain money. He was
                    personally dominant. Certainly, he wasn't anyone's “tool”. Zairians regarded him
                    with great fear and great respect. He was the decision maker but at once corrupt
                    and self-serving beyond description.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it with sort of a “sigh” that you would go to see him?
                        It sounds as if you were asked by the Department of State and the U. S.
                        Government, as well as what your job required, to go in and keep telling him
                        to “clean up his act” or go in with a request to support this or that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: That's right. Often the two would be almost simultaneous. [Laughter] He
                    knew that. We were always asking him for things — asking him for his vote,
                    asking him to show leadership, to extend his neck politically for our benefit.
                    In fact, when problems occurred in Chad, he would send his troops up there to
                    support the American point of view. And then come to us to meet the cost of
                    sending the troops. It was an awkward and difficult relationship. Strangely, I
                    came to enjoy meeting with the man. I was fascinated by his skills and his
                    absolutely amoral cunning. But it was a difficult assignment, distasteful to
                    seek cooperation from a leader who treated his own people with such disdain.</p>
                <p>The domestic political situation [in Zaire] was unraveling rapidly. There were
                    demands for democracy. He was under a great deal of pressure as the economy came
                    apart, particularly after 1990, with the breakdown in Eastern Europe, when there
                    was a call for democracy everywhere. It was clear that the “Cold War” elements
                    in our relationship were going to become much less important. The winds of
                    democracy were sweeping across the whole world. He had to respond to them — had
                    to feel them. Things became very, very tense in Zaire after 1990.</p>
                <p>I was one of those who underestimated Mobutu's staying power. During the last
                    year and a half of my time there I had become quite frustrated because I could
                    not get much of an ear in Washington for repeated recommendations that we
                    disassociate ourselves from this man. I was convinced that it was not in our
                    interest any longer to be so closely identified with him. I thought that we
                    should not give him the kind of American support he had been getting. He used
                    his American connection with great skill in domestic politics. The view he
                    cultivated was, “You can't dispense with Mobutu. He's the American man.” I
                    wanted to get that view set aside but could not get cooperation at home for all
                    of the reasons that I mentioned. Plus, I guess, another argument that was most
                    commonly voiced in Washington. For instance, I put into our “Goals and
                    Objectives Plan” for the following year, 1991: Primary Objective - Gradual
                    disassociation from Mobutu. This came back crossed out, with the comment, “We
                    can't do that, be serious. It's out of the question.”</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>The feeling in Washington — and this was finally articulated fairly clearly by
                    the National Security Council and people near the top levels of the Department
                    of State — was that you don't lightly work to get rid of a leader without
                    knowing who's going to replace him, particularly in a volatile situation. Mobutu
                    was the devil that we knew, and so forth. Washington would challenge me to
                    specify what would come after Mobutu. My answer would be that there were several
                    possible formulations and several competent leaders who could step in. I could
                    not predict which would prevail. I didn't know. But any juxtaposition of
                    possibilities and people would be preferable, both for us and for Zaire, to the
                    present situation. So therefore we should stop behaving in a way which helped to
                    keep him in power. This analysis was not marketable in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This involves both the Department and the Embassy and may
                        be classified. What was the role of the CIA? Was this a CIA country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, I believe that the role of the CIA can be exaggerated. The CIA
                    historically had a long record of cooperation with the government of Zaire. CIA
                    personnel had played a role in the early days of Patrice Lumumba, when the Congo
                    was truly the cockpit of the Cold War. It was the first place where UN troops
                    were deployed, in the early 1960's, during the Kennedy administration. This was
                    where [then UN Secretary General] Dag Hammarskjold died in a plane accident in
                    Zambia, traveling to a meeting in Zaire, or, rather, the Congo at the time. The
                    CIA then — in defense of American interests — had played a major role in Zaire.
                    CIA officers had formed bonds with the government and the power structure of the
                    time. CIA officers continued to be significant “players” throughout the next 25
                    years, including the time when I was there. In fact, Mobutu liked it that way.
                    It served his interest to underline our strategic and security cooperation, so
                    he worked to maintain links with the American intelligence and defense
                    communities as well as the State Department.</p>
                <p>During my time as Ambassador the Central Intelligence Agency performed in a
                    competent and responsible way, always in consultation with me, always ready to
                    take policy guidance from the political side of the U.S. Government. The CIA has
                    been badly maligned in Zaire and in some other places for doing its job to the
                    best of its ability. I found the CIA to be a capable arm available to support me
                    when I needed it, and a precious resource for advice and contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems clear that, as far as Washington was concerned,
                        Mobutu was getting to be a heavier and heavier burden — as seen in media and
                        other reporting. The linchpin that was keeping him useful to us was the Cold
                        War. Was it simply pragmatists in the NSC and the Department of State who
                        wanted to keep up our relationship with him, or what was it? Why couldn't we
                        figure out a way to begin to disassociate ourselves from him?</hi>

                <p>HARROP: There were several things. There's always an inertia in policy, a
                    reluctance to take risky initiatives or sometimes any initiatives at all. “If it
                    ain't broke...” One hears the plea of don't disturb a political system when what
                    you may be creating is chaos — more chaos than you have already, and you don't
                    know who's going to replace him. It could become worse, the argument runs. You
                    at least have influence in the present system, and you may not have some
                    influence over what replaces it. Some people, I'm sorry to say, said, “Look, we
                    do have certain obligations to this man who has cooperated with us over and over
                    again, whatever you may think of him morally.”</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there was another significant element which some in Washington may
                    have understood better than I did. I did not sufficiently appreciate the fact
                    that our influence in Zaire, despite all appearances was rather limited. Just
                    before I left Zaire, which was in May, 1991 — I can't recall exactly — I did a
                    kind of valedictory, confidential report summing up my time there, my
                    predictions of what was going to happen, and my recommendations for future
                    policy. I had been on the scene three and one-half years. I reiterated very
                    strongly that we must disassociate ourselves from Mobutu. I made it clear that,
                    in my view, Mobutu was not going to last much longer. I think that I predicted
                    he could last, given present internal and international pressures, between seven
                    and 10 months longer. I wrote that the situation was falling apart around him,
                    he had destroyed his country, people were becoming hungry, and the opposition
                    was growing. I expected there was going to be even greater chaos in Zaire and
                    that Mobutu was going to be forced from power; if the United States was
                    perceived as supporting the dictator against the will of the people, our
                    influence with his successors would be attenuated, to put it mildly.</p>
                <p>My prediction was largely mistaken, at least my time table was premature. It
                    turned out that I both underestimated Mobutu and overestimated our own
                    influence. Two years later we did finally disassociate ourselves from him, four
                    years too late in my view. It happened a year or so ago, but Mobutu has held on.
                    Part of his genius was utilizing the United States, explaining that one reason
                    that he was in power was that he was America's man, America backed him, and so
                    forth. Consciously or unconsciously, he himself exaggerated the influence of the
                    United States. Mobutu's own skills and Mobutu's dominance of his own political
                    system kept him in power — far more than the support of the United States.
                    During the last 18 months or so since we have disassociated ourselves from
                    Mobutu the Belgians and French have gone along with us. They are the other two
                    major powers concerned with Zaire. One of our problems in the past always has
                    been a certain rivalry with them, a rivalry Mobutu manipulated quite
                    brilliantly. At last all three governments have disassociated ourselves from
                    him, but Mobutu has held on. The situation gets worse and worse. There is now a
                    serious degree of starvation in this wealthy, food-producing nation. It's a
                    tragic situation. But Mobutu has still not fallen. Copper production and exports
                    are finished, but the President has cornered diamond sales to field his
                    needs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the policy side in Washington one of the complaints
                        which has been made was that, under Secretary of State James Baker policy
                        making was pretty well concentrated within a very tight group, and the
                        members of this group were very much involved in the dissolution of the
                        Soviet Union. In this view, incidents like the Gulf War occurred because
                        there was inertia in the system, and the system perpetuated inertia. Do you
                        think that it is fair to say that this is part of the explanation or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I don't know. Baker made a visit to Zaire in January or February, 1991.
                    He came out for the independence celebrations in Namibia. We had played the lead
                    part in ensuring independence for Namibia. Baker stopped in Zaire and saw
                    Mobutu. I found him quite open to policy analysis and ideas. I thought that he
                    handled Mobutu with great skill. I suppose that Baker's interest in Central
                    Africa at that time, to the extent Africa was on his agenda, from a geopolitical
                    or geostrategic point of view, was Angola, a Cold War theater, more than the
                    domestic situation in Zaire. However, I do not feel that we suffered from lack
                    of Baker's personal involvement. I think that the places where he was focusing
                    his attention were, in fact, more important to us than Zaire. I don't criticize
                    him for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like to work in Zaire at that time — you and
                        your staff in the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Do you mean was there a hostile or dangerous atmosphere?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A hostile atmosphere. Was it difficult to operate
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, it was not hostile. I think that the Americans have always
                    appreciated the fact that the Zairian people have a certain tolerance, and
                    perhaps a docility — which may be too strong a word. I wouldn't use that word
                    myself. There was a deep resentment of the United States on the part of Mobutu
                    and his intimates who were running the country — a resentment of our pressures
                    and of our apparent support for the opposition, for the so-called democratic
                    elements that were trying to get at him, or lack of gratitude for their
                    political support of American interests. That was deeply resented. At the same
                    time there was some little bitterness against the United States on the part of
                    the Zairian people for our tolerance of Mobutu, who was less and less popular.
                    In fact, he was becoming hated as well as feared. So there were plenty of
                    pressures on the Embassy, but none of these pressures was translated into
                    violence or big demonstrations against Americans. This just didn't happen. When
                    violence came, it was generalized, against the “haves” more than against a
                    nationality.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about wandering troops, over-armed troops running

                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>HARROP: Well, the worst days of that came after my departure. There was some of
                    that in Shaba, formerly Katanga Province, during the last year or year and a
                    half that I was there. There were some very difficult attacks on the university
                    and some official murders — a very bad business. But instances of marauding
                    soldiers going around and attacking people were rare, although always a danger.
                    We were chronically concerned about our widely dispersed Peace Corps volunteers
                    and about the thousand or so American missionaries who were all over the
                    country. This was always a worry to us, but there were many fewer actual
                    instances of violence than we expected. Violence, depredations in the army,
                    became very severe in September, 1991, after my departure. There were open
                    riots. The economy was deteriorating to the point that it was inevitable that
                    this sort of thing would happen at some point. In September, 1991, there was
                    wide scale plundering and gunfire in the streets of Kinshasa.. The French
                    Ambassador was killed, apparently by a stray bullet. Since that time it has gone
                    from bad to worse, but it had not reached that point of crisis by the time of my
                    departure. And even now, with the infrastructure, the economy, the currency
                    hardly still existing, Mobutu remains.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: For the Middle East thing.</p>
                <p>Q: Thank you very much. -0- Q: Today is November 23, 1993. We ended with your
                    departure from Zaire. When was that?</p>
                <p>HARROP: I left Zaire at the end of May, 1991. I was there for three and one-half
                    years. Then I returned to the United States for an unusually long preparation
                    prior to going to Israel. There were two reasons. The principal reason,
                    actually, was that Ambassador Brown, my predecessor, was very interested in
                    completing his full three years there. He had come in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was which Brown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Ambassador William A. Brown. He had gone to Israel in December, 1988. He
                    wanted to stay in Tel Aviv until December, 1991. That was all right with me. He
                    asked me to agree to let him stay that long. Secondly, the area was new to me,
                    and this gave me a chance to do a lot of work and get ready for it. The third
                    reason, as it turned out, was that I had the usual delays in getting through the
                    Senate. If I had tried to go sooner, I couldn't have gone anyway. I wasn't
                    confirmed until December, 1991. Q: How did this appointment come about?</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>HARROP: I was surprised by it because I had just been reminded that I would
                    complete 10 years in the rank of Career Minister in October, 1991. Under the new
                    regulations, therefore, I would have to retire due to time in class as I no
                    longer would hold a presidential appointment. I didn't really see much else that
                    might be coming up. The possibility of an appointment as Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs was in my mind, but I didn't think that that was a realistic
                    possibility, given the fact that Hank Cohen was doing a splendid job. There was
                    no particular reason to change him from that position. I assumed that I would
                    retire.</p>
                <p>I had had a message from the Director General, who called me up to say that I was
                    one of the candidates for Ambassador to Pakistan or Israel. I said that I was
                    surprised to hear that because I didn't have any deep background on those areas
                    but that I would certainly be delighted to take either assignment on. I did not
                    think that such an appointment was likely to be made, because I could think of
                    two or three colleagues who had deeper knowledge of those areas than I did and
                    who might be available for them. In the autumn of 1990 I talked about this with
                    the Director General again, and he said, “No, you are a serious candidate, and
                    I'll let you know if anything comes up.” Then I had a visit in Zaire from
                    Congressman Steve Solarz, an old friend of mine who still follows Africa, though
                    at that time he was pretty much focused on Asia...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Congressman Steve Solarz...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: A Congressman from New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very much involved in foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Very much so and very much involved in Zaire, as the former chairman of
                    the House of Representatives Subcommittee for Africa. He came for a visit to
                    Zaire. I must say that we had some very interesting discussions with Mobutu
                    during his visit there. When he arrived at the airport [in Zaire], he said,
                    “Well, congratulations! I hear that you're going to be our next Ambassador to
                    Israel.” I said, “Well, I'm very glad to learn that.” Then on the next day I
                    received a formal note that the President had approved me for that job.</p>
                <p>So I set about trying to prepare for it. I had not had experience in the Middle
                    East before that, so it was a great challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two questions on this early period. First, did you have
                        any feeling that you were being “vetted” by the “American Jewish Lobby”
                        before you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>HARROP: No, I don't think so. I must say that, during this whole experience
                    leading up to my appointment and during my service as Ambassador to Israel, I
                    never had a sense of hostility or of “vetting” from the very articulate American
                    Jewish community. There was only one occasion when I went up to address the
                    Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations in New York during the
                    autumn of 1991, as I was getting ready to go to Israel. They have a sort of
                    formal program there. This organization is one of the many efforts, and the most
                    successful so far, to try to coordinate and rationalize the “world” of Jewish
                    organizations in this country. American Jews are very competitive, very
                    organization minded, and very political. They have dozens and dozens of
                    overlapping organizations. In an effort to rationalize that situation and to be
                    more effective they set up a Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
                    Organizations. This organization has been in existence for some years.</p>
                <p>The occasion was one of their lunchtime meetings, which is their custom. There
                    may have been 45 people there in the room in New York. I gave a talk. There was,
                    I would say, some quite critical questions [asked of me]. There were questions
                    about American relations with Israel, about the loan guarantee, some of the
                    usual political hobby horses about the sentencing of Jonathan Pollard...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was convicted of spying [for Israel]...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: That question came up over and again during my tenure [as Ambassador to
                    Israel]. In fact, it came up just a few weeks ago once again, when Prime
                    Minister Rabin raised it with President Clinton. A number of rather critical
                    questions were asked, but I sensed then — and afterwards reached the firm
                    conclusion — that this was a matter of style. I was not being subjected to any
                    particular inquisition, nor were they being particularly hostile toward me.
                    These were questions on which a lot of these organizations had a particular
                    slant, and they were pushing their own slant. [The people attending the
                    luncheon] had to go back to their own boards and report what they said to the
                    new [United States] Ambassador.</p>
                <p>I concluded that this process was not a particular case of “vetting.” In fact, I
                    really felt that, starting from the beginning and throughout my time in Israel,
                    I had a very satisfactory and successful relationship with the American Jewish
                    leadership. Of course, they come to Israel frequently. I must have spoken an
                    average of once a week to a visiting American delegation of one sort or another.
                    Many of these organizations have their annual, directors' meetings in Jerusalem.
                    I saw a great deal of these Jewish leaders, and some of the individual leaders —
                    people like Abe Foxman, of the Anti-Defamation League; Robert Lifton, of the
                    American Jewish Congress; or Al Moses, of the American Jewish Committee — are
                    people whom I regard as good, personal friends. I saw them very often. In fact,
                    I'm going up next week to an award ceremony for Robert Lifton in New York.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Although the American Jewish community, AIPAC [America-Israel Public Affairs
                    Committee] and Jewish organizations maintain a considerable pressure on policy
                    toward Israel, it is a pressure which is not entirely seamless. That is, there
                    are differences within the Jewish community. As a matter of fact, you go from a
                    fairly “liberal” point of view in the American Jewish Congress with Robert
                    Lifton, across the spectrum to really “hard Right,” hard “conservative”
                    positions. You can even go to the left of Lifton to the “Americans for Peace
                    Now” group. Some of the senior members of the Clinton administration were active
                    in Peace Now. Peter Adelman, who, I think, holds a sub-cabinet position in the
                    [Clinton] administration and was Assistant Dean at Georgetown University School
                    of Law, was the president of Americans for Peace Now. Then you had the
                    ultra-Orthodox group and you had some hard line Right-wing people, many of whom
                    I dealt with frequently in New York. They are really, I think, to the Right of
                    the Likud Party [in Israel]. They support the concepts of a Greater Israel,
                    “Don't Yield an Inch of Territory,” “It is the Biblical right of the Jewish
                    people to this entire land [of Palestine],” and “You cannot trust any agreement
                    made with the Arabs.” “The Syrians will attack the Golan Heights if they're
                    allowed to do so again.” Really, they hold “harder” positions than you hear,
                    except in unusual quarters, in Israel.</p>
                <p>The relationship is an extremely interesting one. You have the situation in which
                    a huge outflow of private money — around $1.0 billion a year — goes to Israel in
                    many different forms. I guess you could not call all of that money “grants,”
                    because a good deal of it — several hundred million dollars — is in the form of
                    State of Israel bonds. These are rather a good economic investment, among other
                    things, because legislation was put through to make this a tax-free investment
                    [in the U. S.]. A lot of money is spent on that. Many people give money to their
                    synagogues by purchasing these bonds in the name of the synagogue.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I developed a theory, since I was interested in the Israeli economy and
                    the reform of the Israeli economy — to try to liberalize it a bit and to get rid
                    of the overhang of socialism from the early days [of Israel]. There is still a
                    very large parastatal sector — about 40 percent of the economy is either in the
                    hands of the government or in the hands of the great labor union, Histadrut,
                    which, like labor unions throughout the world, is now losing influence and
                    political authority but still has these huge holdings. It owns banks,
                    corporations, conglomerates, and all sorts of things. I was really working, as a
                    matter of fact, with the new Governor of the Bank of Israel, Yaacov Frankel,
                    who'd been...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, after I got there. I was just going into one section of my activities
                    there. [Frankel] had been a senior executive of the IMF [International Monetary
                    Fund] for some years and was very interested in reform. As a matter of fact, the
                    Faculties of Economics of Hebrew University in Jerusalem and particularly of Tel
                    Aviv University were very active in these matters. The Labor Party was very
                    active in these matters, so that it was a worthwhile issue to follow.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>While on this subject, because we were speaking about the American Jewish
                    community, I found that it was a matter of disappointment to many Israelis and
                    to anyone who cares anything about Israel that American backers of Israel are
                    prepared to give extraordinarily generous aid to Israel, but not to invest
                    there. What's needed is investment, particularly in view of the large inflow of
                    new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Jobs are very important, and the
                    expansion of the economy is crucial. That is what the debate over the [U. S.]
                    loan guarantee was about — to provide funds for [economic] expansion.</p>
                <p>I frequently spoke to the American Jewish community about the fact that if they
                    really wanted to help Israel, they should invest there and not just grant money
                    to the government. Invest in some productive enterprise. They were very
                    reluctant to do it. Only a very few have done that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they be so reluctant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, there are several theories on that. One theory is that successful
                    Americans, whether Jewish or not, are reluctant to put their money in an economy
                    which, in fact, has a lot of difficulties for the investor. There are rather
                    numerous controls — over regulation, in fact — on labor, capital, foreign
                    exchange, factory location. American supporters of Israel, as much as anyone
                    else, are concerned about security questions and about the security of their
                    capital. However, you might suppose that some of those questions would not make
                    much sense if you were prepared to give a million dollars to Israel. You might
                    be prepared to invest it there.</p>
                <p>In fact, it doesn't work out that way. One theory which people cite is that
                    American Jews who support Israel tend to look on Israel as in some sense a
                    charity. The way they look at their synagogue. You don't do business in the
                    synagogue. You give money to the synagogue to support it. There is an odd,
                    psychological feeling there that you as an American Jew may be in some
                    particular business, where you are a very effective and a very tough
                    businessman, perhaps. But you don't think of Israel as a place where you do that
                    sort of thing. I don't know whether that theory holds water or not, but it's
                    hard to find a theory to explain such a peculiar phenomenon. It was and is too
                    bad.</p>
                <p>I was struck by the intensity of interest on issues among the American Jewish
                    community. I had dinner with a group of ultra-orthodox rabbis and others in New
                    York and met with many people of many political viewpoints there. Some American
                    Jews from Washington were extremely helpful to me in arranging meetings with all
                    of the different [Jewish] organizations, setting up schedules for me to meet
                    people. I felt that I was able to get a pretty good footing in this whole
                    community here before I went to Israel.</p>

                <p>HARROP: Not very much, as a matter of fact. I tried to call on Prince Bandar, the
                    Ambassador from Saudi Arabia. I wanted to meet him and talk to him. I had met
                    the Egyptian Ambassador and chatted with him very briefly. However, I was not
                    able to see Ambassador Bandar.</p>

                <p>HARROP: I don't know. He tries to keep himself on a lofty plane of political and
                    social activity which makes it hard to get at him. So I would hesitate to say
                    that he made a conscious decision not to see me. He may just not have been
                    available.</p>

                        It was basically a new bureau for you. One of the things that you hear at
                        times is that whoever is our Ambassador to Israel becomes a captive of the
                        Israelis and their supporters and is sort of at odds with the people working
                        in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Did you get any of this feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, I didn't. It's a fairly sophisticated bureau. I think that there are
                    some pretty heavy, pro-Israel pressures, but the bureau itself is fairly
                    balanced. The heavy, pro-Israel pressures, which are very subtle indeed, came
                    out of the...Well, I think of Dennis Ross, who is now the coordinator of...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was on [Secretary of State] Baker's staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: He was Baker's right hand man for both Soviet activities and the Near
                    East and was, in many ways, the creative mind behind Baker's remarkable feat in
                    bringing about the peace talks, [beginning with] the Madrid Conference. [Ross]
                    is a man of extraordinarily high intellect, with a very agile, supple, and
                    creative mind — a forceful fellow. However, I think that he is essentially a
                    Zionist and is wedded to that point of view. I suppose you can go a step beyond
                    that and say that it's all very well to criticize him for being Zionist, but if,
                    in fact, he's doing something for Israel which is also in the American interest
                    and in the interest of peace, he should be congratulated for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>But the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs did not give me that impression. I spoke
                    with the former NEA experts, and there I think you find a little more of an
                    anti-Israel slant. I mean all of those people who have worked for so many years
                    on the Middle East, like Talcott Seelye, Dick Parker, Bill Kontos, an old friend
                    of mine, and many other such people. I think that they often have a little
                    difficulty being even-handed, because they have been steeped in the business for
                    so long. They've come to resent the role of Israel very much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Yes, I did. I called on, probably, 15 members of Congress and met with
                    segments of the [House of Representatives] Foreign Affairs Committee and others
                    there. I found that there's a great deal of interest there, of course. I spent a
                    good deal of time with Senator Lautenberg..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Lautenberg is from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: From New Jersey, a Democrat. He is a former President of the United
                    Jewish Appeal in the United States — a very fine man. I spent some time with
                    Congressman Lee Hamilton [Democrat, Indiana] and quite a few others. It was an
                    interesting experience to hear their point of view. Most of them said, “Well,
                    I'll be seeing you over there,” because they visit Israel in large numbers. In
                    fact, it's true. I guess that later on, in Israel, I saw almost all of the
                    members of Congress whom I had called on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: January, 1992. I was delayed a long time in Congress. I did not
                    experience the systematic kind of opposition there that I'd had in the past from
                    various quarters — Senator Helms and others. It was more a question of
                    bureaucracy and slow-going. I think that when it became known that I was not
                    really intending to go to Israel until early in 1992, the Department did not
                    press as hard to push me forward, because my approval was not as urgent as some
                    of the other nominees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out to Israel, did you anticipate facing any
                        major problems there? There, more than anywhere else. Some places you go to
                        and you just take things as they come. There are always some issues. What
                        were they [regarding Israel]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>HARROP: The primary issues included the peace process, which had begun. Secretary
                    of State Baker, by a remarkable effort, had made nine trips to the area in eight
                    months. It was just a superhuman effort on his part, and I respect him immensely
                    for it. He had finally broken through to get direct peace talks started between
                    Israel and her four main adversaries, if you will, the Lebanese, Syrians,
                    Jordanians, and the Palestinians themselves. That process had just begun at the
                    end of October, 1991, and more talks were being scheduled. They were still at
                    the point, then, of haggling over the “great” problems of where they should
                    meet, the shape of the table, and that kind of thing. However, the breakthrough
                    had occurred, and advancing the talks was a central preoccupation.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we were in the middle of the very tough discussion on loan guarantees
                    for Israel, due to extremely heavy immigration [into Israel]. About half a
                    million Jews from Central Europe and Central Asia had come in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue of the loan guarantees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, let me go through it. Because there had been this huge immigration
                    into Israel, the Israelis were in need of funds for [their] absorption. Under
                    the laws of Israel any Jew is welcome to come [to Israel] at any time, and, of
                    course, they encourage [this inflow] immensely. They want [Israel] to be the
                    homeland of the Jewish people. They feel that it's a matter of survival for
                    them, since the population growth rate of the Palestinians and Arabs generally
                    is much, much higher than that of the Israelis. So they were looking for
                    financial help to absorb these people. It's very expensive to arrange for
                    housing, care, language instruction, jobs, education, health, and all the rest
                    for these immigrants. More than one-tenth of the previous population of the
                    country came to Israel in this new wave from the Soviet Union. In fact, it was
                    really more like one-fifth. There had been talk of the United States providing
                    guarantees for Israel to raise, in international capital markets, something like
                    $10 billion over an unspecified period of time to use for the absorption of
                    these recent immigrants. They could obtain that money at a vastly more
                    preferable rate of interest and preferable terms if the loans were guaranteed by
                    the United States Government.</p>
                <p>We were then dealing with the conservative and hard Right, Likud Party government
                    of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Secretary of State Baker and President Bush
                    had said that the American taxpayer is just not going to finance settlements in
                    the Occupied Territories indirectly. That's all there was to it. They said that
                    the settlement policy of the then Israeli Government was making it very hard to
                    have a peace process of any validity. The Arabs won't talk when the Israeli
                    Government is trying gradually to shift the situation on the ground to the point
                    where there isn't need...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain for the historical record what
                        “settlement policy” means?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>HARROP: The “settlement policy” in this sense was the practice of the Likud
                    government of implanting as many Israeli villages, towns, and settlements in the
                    Occupied Territories — in the West Bank primarily but also, to some extent, in
                    the Gaza Strip and on the Golan Heights. This was to make the Occupied
                    Territories more “Jewish” and to make it more difficult ever to turn that land
                    back to the Arabs. It was a very systematic operation. The Minister of Housing
                    in the Shamir Government was Ariel Sharon, one of the toughest and hardest of
                    the Right wing Israeli leaders for many years. They were spending a very large
                    part of the Israeli budget on this program, providing all kinds of incentives.
                    The Israeli Government was actually building housing and settlements at a great
                    rate and subsidizing interest rates and, indeed, every aspect of life to
                    encourage Jews to live in the Occupied Territories. In fact, over a period of a
                    few years they more than doubled the Jewish population in the Occupied
                    Territories. The figure varies — it depends on whether you include the suburbs
                    of East Jerusalem, but the number commonly used is 130,000 or so. That's quite a
                    lot of people. This practice was such an anathema to the whole Arab world, and
                    not only to the Palestinians, that any [Israeli] Government that pursued this
                    kind of policy was fairly clearly not interested in a negotiation based on the
                    exchange of land for peace.</p>
                <p>So Secretary of State Baker and President Bush were really tough on this. But it
                    was not just those two leaders who took this view. It was many influential
                    people in Congress as well, particularly Senator Patrick Leahy [Democrat,
                    Vermont], the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and also the Chairman
                    of the [Senate] Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Assistance. The loan
                    guarantees would have to be considered by that Subcommittee.</p>
                <p>This was a very difficult issue. AIPAC [America-Israel Public Affairs Committee]
                    was extremely active on this issue, pressing for the loan guarantees to be
                    approved, without any condition on settlement policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to clear up this point. The [Israeli Government]
                        policy was, basically, very Right wing oriented. Was AIPAC at that time a
                        supporter of the Right wing [in Israel]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>HARROP: Absolutely. AIPAC gave the hard Right, [Israeli Government] its support,
                    because that government, in one form or another, had been in power for 17 years,
                    starting with Prime Minister Begin and the Right wing Likud Party. The American
                    Jewish community has tended to reflect the political outlook of the government
                    in office in Israel — though this later changed a bit, during the time I was in
                    Israel. The American Jewish community, by and large — not the Left, not those
                    most interested in negotiations [with the Palestinians] and peace — from the
                    broad center all the way over to the Right was very much in favor of these loan
                    guarantees to help Israel and to help [the absorption] of the immigrants. It was
                    regarded as a very important thing for everyone concerned that all of these,
                    perhaps two million Jews from the Soviet Union, who were thought of as being
                    under great risk, [be resettled in Israel]. This dates back to the days of the
                    late Senator [Henry] Jackson [Democrat, Washington] who was trying to arrange
                    linkages of all sorts...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Jackson-Vanik Bill...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: All sorts of arms control agreements with the Soviets linked to the
                    release of the Jews [from the Soviet Union]. One of the liberal things that
                    Gorbachev did was to allow [these Jews] to leave [the Soviet Union]. They began
                    to pour out. The American Jewish community had a real sense of identification
                    with and support for those people and pushed for [the approval of the loan
                    guarantees]. The watchword was, “Why should you mix up humanitarian questions
                    with political questions?” They felt that it was a matter of humanitarian aid to
                    help in the absorption of these hundreds of thousands of Jews. The political
                    issues of the settlements should be dealt with on other grounds, in this view.
                    Anyway, it was a major debate. That was one of the things that I was going to
                    have to look at.</p>
                <p>American defense support of Israel has always been a tricky and difficult
                    question. There were allegations of diversion of American technology by the
                    Israeli arms industry before I went there. I was concerned about that
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The intimacy and the breadth of the United States-Israel relationship is such
                    that it's almost impossible for an American Ambassador to complete his homework
                    before going there — even with the six months that I had.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>I called on a good number of the members of the cabinet of the United States
                    Government. You know, you seldom would meet a senior official in any government
                    department in the United States who did not have some type of bilateral program
                    going with a counterpart agency in Israel, who was not that very week receiving
                    a delegation from Israel in his area of concern, or who did not have a
                    delegation or mission over in Israel at the time — whether it involved questions
                    of environmental science or other matters. I recall that the head of the Federal
                    Aviation Agency, with whom I had a long talk, said that he really had a deep
                    span of cooperative activities with Israel. His was one of the areas where no
                    one could say that it was a one way street, with just the United States helping
                    out Israel. We were, he said, of considerable help to them because of our
                    experience and expertise in air traffic control matters — a difficult question
                    in Israel because of the minute size of the country. He said that we benefited
                    immensely from our two-way cooperation and consultation on aviation and airport
                    security, in which the Israelis were probably world leaders in the technology of
                    airport security as well as the practices of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps historians in the future won't be concerned about
                        these matters, but we're talking about bombs or weapons being smuggled on
                        board...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Sure. They're very expert and very experienced in this. FAA, in fact, was
                    helping to fund some research, and we were purchasing, as I recall, some of this
                    equipment which was particularly effective in the detection of weaponry or
                    explosive devices at airports. But that is just one example. In education, in
                    almost any field that you'd care to look at, such as transportation or
                    communications, there is a rich, two-way exchange of information and
                    cooperation. Israel benefits, really, from research and technical support money
                    from a lot of different government agencies here, which is not covered by
                    foreign assistance appropriations. For example, in the field of agricultural
                    research some of the advances made in Israel in dry land agriculture have been
                    funded in part by American private and public sources. It was really a challenge
                    to try to keep abreast of all of these things. In a way, although it's not quite
                    the same, you could make an analogy between being Ambassador to Israel and being
                    Ambassador to Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just going to say that it sounds like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The parallel, transnational lines of activities are so great, and the
                    telephone is used so commonly. Although the telephone is probably not used quite
                    as commonly between Israel and the United States as between Canada and the
                    United States, this is a major challenge for the American Ambassador to Israel.
                    The Ambassador's mettle is constantly tested in keeping abreast of these
                    things.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the [U. S.] Department of
                        Defense? We had just finished the very successful operation called “Desert
                        Storm,” in which our main diplomatic effort seemed to be to keep the
                        Israelis out of the action and from “queering the deal,” in a way, because
                        we had Arab allies. I've always felt that the Department of Defense has not
                        been too happy with the Israeli connection because, first, it absorbs an
                        awful lot of its power. Also, as seen from the defense side, [Israel] really
                        isn't all that much of a bastion for the [U.S.] military as it's been
                        touted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There's a certain schizophrenia, I think, in the Pentagon toward Israel.
                    There is some resentment of the fact that a lot of aid and resource transfers to
                    Israel are “imposed” upon the Department of Defense by the Congress. In recent
                    years particularly — for example during the last three years or so, as the
                    United States budget generally and the defense budget like all the rest have
                    come under increasing pressure — the strong supporters of Israel in the
                    Congress, seeing that it was going to be difficult to increase the
                    appropriations for foreign assistance under that category, have begun to make
                    inroads within the defense budget to earmark appropriated defense funds for
                    Israel. Whether it's the transfer of excess or supposedly excess equipment or
                    weapons systems or whether it's in the form of the financing of R&amp;D in
                    Israel, this is very large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “R&amp;D” means Research and Development.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Very large funds have been involved there. So the Department of Defense
                    feels some resentment. On the other hand I say the defense attitude is
                    schizophrenic because there is tremendous respect, on the part of the American
                    defense system, for Israel, for Israelis, for the military job that they've
                    done, and for their competence — both as scientists, engineers, and as military
                    leaders and fighters. There is a very close and warm camaraderie between the
                    Israeli and American military establishments at all levels. I mean, I saw a
                    great deal of it. We have approximately 3,000 Department of Defense visitors to
                    Israel per year, from generals who come to visit — you almost always have the
                    commanders from NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] forces in Europe — to
                    people who come down from all the different branches of the [U.S.] military
                    service, as well as the Supreme Allied Commander [of NATO]. This is entirely
                    aside from the large number of joint exercises that we have and entirely aside
                    from the 50,000 or so American sailors who come on shore leave during Sixth
                    Fleet visits to Haifa and Ashdod. Most of the service secretaries come over at
                    one time or another, as well as the Chief of Naval Operations. The Sixth Fleet
                    commander visits Israel several times a year. Other visitors include the heads
                    of the different commands in the United States which do cooperative work with
                    Israel regarding one system or another.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>We must have to have a very large Defense Attach� office in Israel. I guess that
                    about 60 percent of my mission was composed of defense personnel, because of the
                    volume of business, commerce, and traffic, back and forth. So I spent a lot of
                    time at the Department of Defense before I went to Israel. We have a structured
                    series of collaborative conferences and consultations every year with Israel.
                    There is a Joint Political Military Group, which meets twice a year, as well as
                    a subgroup which is concerned with military activities, as opposed to political
                    and military activities. The Joint Political Military Group is chaired by either
                    the Under Secretary of State for Security Affairs or by the Assistant Secretary
                    [of State] for Political-Military Affairs. Then there is a separate, annual,
                    structured conference on the setting of the assistance levels for the following
                    year. These are planning groups which have real meaning, and the Israelis attach
                    great importance to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You arrived in Israel, when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: In January, 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the staffing, size, and
                        composition of the Embassy when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It's a large mission — about the same size as two other missions which I
                    have headed: Nairobi [Kenya] and Kinshasa [Zaire], although in both Nairobi and
                    Kinshasa a very large component of the mission consisted of personnel from AID
                    [Agency for International Development] and the Peace Corps. In Israel there is
                    no Peace Corps assigned. There was no AID component there when I arrived.
                    Finally, one AID man was assigned in early 1993. I was afraid that it was the
                    opening wedge of a classical large AID personnel presence. The military element
                    in the mission in Tel Aviv was the big component. I would say that it was a
                    well-staffed mission in terms of composition and the structure. We had a
                    good-sized public affairs office with, I guess, five officers. But you need
                    those people, with so much going on. There is a huge Fulbright program, a large
                    selection of Fulbright professors back and forth. We have continual cultural
                    visits. American symphonies and ballet companies come. Arthur Miller came for a
                    visit. I just can't name them all. And the Israeli press is so hyperactive, so
                    omnipresent, and such a large element of society that relations with the media
                    are a very important part of the responsibilities of the Ambassador as well as
                    the USIS [United States Information Service].</p>
                <p>We had a single commercial officer to try to expand American exports to Israel.
                    There are a lot of American businesses in Israel — although not as many as I
                    think there could and should be. But there is a good deal of two-way trade,
                    particularly in the advanced electronic fields. The Israelis are really on the
                    leading edge of many of those areas, in medical and military applications among
                    other things.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>We had a five or six man Political Section and a four or five officer Economic
                    Section. We had a very large Consular Section because virtually all of the
                    American citizens who have made “aliyah” — the term for emigrating to Israel —
                    have retained American, as well as Israeli citizenship. There are about 100,000
                    American citizens in Israel. This leads to a tremendous volume of consular
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Consulate General in Jerusalem?
                        I've interviewed a number of people over the past decade. The relationship
                        has waxed and waned. The Consulate General is both independent and involved
                        with our Embassy. How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It's historically been a difficult relationship, because the Consul
                    General [in Jerusalem] is not subordinate to the Ambassador in Tel Aviv, for
                    reasons that are fairly easy to see. We don't recognize Israeli sovereignty over
                    Jerusalem. The Consul General in Jerusalem, aside from being concerned with the
                    city of Jerusalem, is really our liaison link to the Palestinians. That's pretty
                    much what that job is. You have the dangers of bureaucratic frictions or
                    jealousies resulting from the autonomy of the post. There is jealousy on the
                    part of the Ambassador that any Consul General in “his” territory is really
                    independent of him. Then there are the technical problems which you can have
                    over budget matters, such as who's responsible for visits and the division of
                    certain functional support responsibilities. Then there was also the almost
                    inescapable, political unease like that which has at times developed between the
                    Embassies in Athens and Ankara, the Embassies in Algiers and Rabat, Delhi and
                    Rawalpindi, or in many other places in the world where there are conflicts
                    between countries. It seems that American Ambassadors and Embassies, despite
                    their best efforts, can't help but reflect local sentiments to some extent.</p>
                <p>I was determined not to have this problem. I spent some time with the new Consul
                    General in Washington before she went to post (a few months ahead of me).</p>

                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>HARROP: Molly Williamson, a person of vast experience in that part of the world.
                    She speaks very fluent Hebrew and Arabic. She is a quite exceptional and very
                    intelligent officer. We just wanted to avoid these problems and we actually did.
                    We inherited certain jealousies because there had not been a good relationship
                    previously. One of the big areas of jealousy was over security — who was
                    responsible for it and did the Regional Security Officer in Tel Aviv supervise
                    the security operation [in Jerusalem]? You can see how such issues could develop
                    in Jerusalem when a Secretary of State, a cabinet member, or a senior
                    Congressional delegation came to Jerusalem for a visit, which frequently
                    happened. Who was responsible and so forth? You can see that these things could
                    become delicate. Who was responsible for determining the nature of advisory
                    cautions to American citizens when the “Intifada” [Arab Palestinian uprising]
                    became particularly heated and there were shootings...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Intifada involved attacks on private citizens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: We managed to work that out. I had a very capable DCM [Deputy Chief of
                    Mission] when I arrived, Mark Parris, a superior Foreign Service Officer. He and
                    I worked very hard with Molly Williamson to arrange the relationship [between
                    the Embassy and the Consulate General in Jerusalem] on the security side — which
                    I think was quite satisfactory in the end and has worked out well since
                    then.</p>
                <p>Then there was also a certain, inescapable jealousy over the fact that, just as a
                    matter of economy, the Budget and Fiscal system, which is, of course, located in
                    Tel Aviv, handles the budget of [the Consulate General in] Jerusalem. The budget
                    [of the Consulate General is handled as a part of] the budget of [the Embassy]
                    in Israel. You have to be very careful of jealousies on that subject.</p>
                <p>Obviously, you get to the question of resources and money, and money is such a
                    terrible problem everywhere now, as I'll go into in a moment with regard to
                    Israel. But we worked these problems through.</p>
                <p>On the political side, we simply refused to have problems. We kept in very close
                    consultation, and we had only occasional differences. I really rode very hard on
                    my substantive staff to be certain that there was no lack of communication [with
                    the Consulate General in Jerusalem]. Any cables that went out were to be fully
                    discussed between us. The only problems we ever got into were situations in
                    which, from our [the Embassy's] point of view, more junior officers in Jerusalem
                    had sent out messages which were of joint [Embassy-Consulate General] concern
                    but which they had not cleared with us. I'm sure that they felt that we did the
                    same thing. But we really kept this to a minimum. It worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a phenomenon within the Foreign
                        Service where, essentially, the junior officers go out and look at the
                        periphery of things, the dissidents, and the problems. They are younger.
                        They get very much engaged in these things. When you have two organizations
                        doing this, it turns into...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Into an area of emotional and ideological involvement. I think that most
                    of our professionals are able to resist the emotional involvement, but it's
                    simply inescapable when you live in a society in which you only hear one point
                    of view, over and over again, day after day. Anyway, as it turned out, that was
                    not a major problem for us. We were able to coordinate very well the visits of
                    Secretary of State Baker and Secretary of State Christopher and of the numerous
                    Congressional groups. That was a matter in which I take satisfaction. I think
                    that Ms. Williamson can, too. We were able to handle our relationship with
                    maturity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there [in Tel Aviv], you mentioned the
                        press. I've been in places where the Ambassador arrives, the press
                        immediately picks up and says, “Ah, Mr. X has come as Ambassador. This means
                        that he's either out to ride roughshod over us, or he's our friend, or
                        something like that.” Did you find yourself being characterized before you
                        knew you had any particular character as far as this was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: There was a lot of that. Israel is a very special place in many, many
                    ways. One aspect is the press, which is just extraordinarily outspoken. I think
                    that there are more daily newspapers per capita in that country than in any
                    other country in the world. Any Israeli newspaper, almost by definition, is a
                    national paper because the country is the size of New Jersey. Speculation is
                    simply uncontrolled. The line between editorial comment and news doesn't exist,
                    so there was a lot of speculation about the outlook of the new Ambassador — is
                    he going to be this way or that way? The speculation ran across the whole gamut.
                    A number of theories built up.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I had to decide very early was how I was going to relate
                    to the press. This is a big problem, because you get misquoted. If you make a
                    slip when you say something, it's going to be “blown up” to the skies as a major
                    policy declaration. People are going to be after you. You're going to be quoted,
                    efforts will be made to manipulate you, and so forth. Some of my predecessors
                    had taken the position that they simply would not deal with the press. This was
                    true of my immediate predecessor. As the media never tired of telling me, they
                    could never get at him. He would never make any comment. In a country which is
                    so obsessed with and so thirsty for news — people walk around the streets
                    listening to transistor radios — this seemed to me to be foregoing voluntarily a
                    major opportunity for communication. Newspapers have a huge circulation. It
                    seemed to be a lost opportunity for the Ambassador not to have some relationship
                    with the media.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>So I decided that, with the greatest prudence and with the advice of a very
                    excellent Public Affairs Officer, I would be available and essentially would try
                    to meet with the press fairly often. In fact, after I'd been there for about
                    five or six weeks, I went onto what they called the “Moked” program. This is
                    Israel's “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” and all the rest, all rolled into
                    one. There's one weekly program featuring an hour's interview of a news making
                    individual. It has astounding ratings. A very large proportion of the country
                    listens to this program. A country that has been through the security
                    experiences that Israel has and a country where hardly a single family has not
                    lost a relative in war is very, very interested in news, in what's going on, in
                    the security situation. That's the explanation for it. I went on that program,
                    and my appearance turned out to be successful. I worked very hard to prepare for
                    it. The interview was in English, and then they “dubbed it over” into Hebrew for
                    the broadcast. I was quite pleased. I was able to make the major points that I
                    wanted to make. I was able to present myself as an individual sympathetic to
                    Israel and aware of the main concerns of the Israeli people, while having a
                    rational, analytical, American view of matters. Also, I was able to avoid
                    appearing to be an intuitive, 100% pro-Israeli American. I was quite pleased
                    with the outcome. I think that, by and large, it went pretty well.</p>
                <p>I had other such experiences, interviews, and discussions with the press, both
                    one-on-one's and in group forums. I got into trouble in Washington on several
                    occasions, usually through a slip of the tongue, a choice of words which was
                    picked up and then expanded by the Israeli media, which is always a great
                    danger. That is immediately picked up by the wire services. Several of the
                    American newspapers have full-time correspondents in Jerusalem — the “Washington
                    Post,” the “New York Times,” and other large publications. That would happen,
                    and people would get upset back in Washington until they learned the context of
                    the quote. We went through this several times. But I think that, by and large,
                    the gain far outweighed the cost. None of these little slips ever caused a real
                    problem, in policy terms. Everyone is always so nervous about relations with
                    Israel that anything on the news is very much noted. I think that my decision to
                    be occasionally available to the press was the right decision, and it worked out
                    fairly well. It was difficult to deal with the public through the media in
                    Israel, but also enjoyable, in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Israel. The Shamir Government — the Likud
                        Party government, you said — had been in power for about 17 years. It was a
                        “hard Right” wing government. We had our difficulties with it for a long,
                        long time. How did you find dealing with the Shamir Government at that stage
                        of its existence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>HARROP: This was the last six months of the Likud government in Israel, which, as
                    I mentioned, had been in office for about 17 years. It wasn't clear by any means
                    that Likud would lose the election. It looked like a very close election, and it
                    was. The United States is very important to Israel. I could always meet with the
                    Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister, if I wished to. They make themselves
                    available to the American Ambassador. In fact, the government makes itself
                    available to any member of the American Congress. Even a freshman Congressman,
                    in his first months in office, if he comes to Israel, can see the Prime
                    Minister, the Minister of Finance, or the Foreign Minister if he wishes. They
                    will make themselves available because they recognize the importance of the
                    United States to them.</p>
                <p>The situation now, under the Rabin Government, is a little bit different than it
                    was under the Shamir Government, because the perception in Israel [during the
                    Shamir Government] was that the Bush-Baker administration was rather tough on
                    Israel. They felt that they would have to obtain what they sought in the United
                    States, through the Congress — not the Executive Branch. A great deal of effort
                    was made to work through AIPAC and through the several, intimate friends of
                    Israel in the American Congress — such as Larry Smith and Tom Lantos in the
                    House of Representatives and Senators Inouye, Moynihan, and Lautenberg in the
                    Senate. Anyway, the relationship with Congress was rather special for that
                    reason.At the present time that's no longer quite the case because one of the
                    changes which Prime Minister Rabin wished to make was to deal directly with the
                    Executive Branch of the American government and not go around it. Prime Minister
                    Rabin made that clear during my first meeting with him. That point came up
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>However, it was not difficult to deal with the Likud government because of their
                    perception of the United States. But there were differences. I had a long and
                    difficult interview with Arik Sharon. He was trying to justify his “settlement
                    policy” but was doing it in a very confrontational way, knowing that I would not
                    agree with him. I had difficult meetings with Ehud Olmert, who is now Mayor of
                    Jerusalem. He was then Minister of Health and was, I thought, irresponsibly
                    critical of the Bush administration. One or two other members of the Shamir
                    Government were difficult, but you could always be received and could always
                    work with the government. Israelis are, by and large, personable, attractive,
                    vivacious, intelligent people. For a diplomat it's an exciting and fun place to
                    be assigned, both professionally and personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard this from a number of people who have come [to
                        Israel] from other places where either you're a peripheral person, as an
                        American diplomat, or else, say, involved with the Arabs. You really don't
                        get into [the society]. [In Israel] you were right in the middle of
                        everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>HARROP: The Israelis are engaged in issues, personally and ideologically, and you
                    talk about issues. I remember that I was taken aback, when I presented my
                    credentials to President Herzog, a most engaging and charming man — an
                    intellectual and a man of parts. He set an example, which I encountered over and
                    over again. I had presented the diplomatic letter. I said a few words in Hebrew
                    to him, and he said, in English, “Not bad!” Then, as we sat down to have coffee,
                    he turned to me and said, “I don't know what I'm going to do about the Likud
                    [Party].” I said, “What do you mean, Mr. President?” I thought that he was going
                    to open our conversation about the day, what nice weather we were having, or how
                    many children I had and that sort of thing. He said, “I'm trying to change the
                    electoral system. I'm trying to raise the threshold of votes needed to obtain a
                    seat in the Knesset to cut down on the mess we have with this large number of
                    small parties, which makes it hard to form coalitions. I think I've got Labor on
                    board, but Likud is getting difficult again.” We immediately entered into a
                    highly substantive and highly political discussion of that, among other
                    issues.</p>
                <p>I found subsequently that Israelis simply don't have time for small talk. They
                    don't bother with small talk. You meet someone for the first time and you begin
                    discussing tough economic and political issues, right away, which I rather
                    enjoy. I think that most people do. It's just a national characteristic. I
                    enjoyed my introduction to this, but it was surprising.</p>
                <p>There was a little sense of distance with the Likud because, in part, they were
                    disingenuous about the peace process. I think that the global, political
                    circumstances had backed them into agreeing to become engaged in this whole
                    peace discussion. They couldn't resist, when it was offered to them — direct,
                    face to face negotiations with their Arab counterparts. But they were not
                    serious about it, which I think in retrospect was reprehensible. Prime Minister
                    Shamir actually made a statement which made clear, after he'd left office, that
                    he was not really committed to this process. He was not wholeheartedly or
                    frankly engaging in negotiations.The Likud criticism of the Bush-Baker
                    administration I found offensive. In fact, I spoke publicly about it a number of
                    times because I feel, to this day, that, if you strip away all the rhetoric, and
                    all the pro-Israeli “sweet talk,” which is so common in our political system, no
                    American administration has done more for Israel than the Bush-Baker
                    administration. The Gulf War neutralized their primary adversary in the Middle
                    East — Iraq. [The Bush administration] then went forward with this tremendous
                    commitment to the peace process and was able to reach [agreement] on real
                    negotiations with Israel's adversaries, on Israeli terms. Lastly, the resource
                    transfers to Israel grew during this administration, in part because of the Gulf
                    War. Grant aid to Israel from the United States, you know, is about half of our
                    aid to the entire world. It's more than half in terms of grant military aid — 53
                    percent. It's about 45 percent of our grant economic aid to the entire world.
                    I'm not talking about Israel plus Egypt. I'm talking about Israel alone.
                    Transfers like that were actually expanded in various, temporary ways under the
                    Bush administration. I was offended when I encountered a common perception among
                    both Israelis and the American Jewish leadership that the Bush administration
                    was somehow hostile toward Israel. Nothing could have been farther from the
                    truth. Q: To what do you attribute this?</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>HARROP: I attribute it to the lack of a kind of “touchy-feeley” style. There was
                    a kind of pragmatic toughness, a rhetorical toughness within the [Bush]
                    administration. Also, there was no great personal warmth. Actually, President
                    Bush and Prime Minister Shamir really didn't like each other much, and did not
                    easily communicate. It was a big problem. Then there were such things as the
                    celebrated quotation of Secretary of State Baker, using four-letter words about
                    “the Jews” in an American political context. This quotation may or may not have
                    been accurate, but it's the kind of thing that politicians say privately. I
                    think that the context was that someone had asked what the American Jewish
                    reaction would be to this or that. Baker was quoted as having said, “F___ the
                    Jews. They have never been for us anyway.” Whether he said it or not, this
                    reported remark had nothing whatsoever to do with the policies of the [U.S.]
                    Government toward Israel, which were, from any objective point of view,
                    extremely favorable.</p>
                <p>At any rate the negotiations were very difficult. I dealt a great deal with the
                    members of the negotiating teams. The Israelis had to have several negotiating
                    teams to handle this complex of negotiations [on preparations for the Middle
                    East peace talks]. They were dealing separately with each of these negotiating
                    sessions. All of the teams would come together, gradually focusing in
                    Washington. It was all done in Washington after a time. They would have an
                    Israeli group dealing with Lebanese and an Israeli group dealing with Syrians.
                    There was an Israeli group, a bifurcated, double group, dealing with the
                    Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, which, in fact, was two delegations, and these
                    were separate talks. So there were four separate negotiations going on at once,
                    plus five different, multilateral, regional negotiations including most of the
                    Arab countries. A total of 12 different Arab countries were involved. It was
                    really a success to get them together. There were also the major world powers,
                    the Europeans, Japanese, Chinese, and even some of the smaller powers. The
                    Australians were involved. The Canadians took an active role, as did the
                    Austrians and the Scandinavians. The negotiations concerned water, refugees,
                    arms control, and economic development.</p>
                <p>So there were the four, bilateral negotiations that I mentioned with the Syrians,
                    Lebanese, Jordanians, and Palestinians, and then five of these large,
                    multilateral, regional talks on the future of water and water availability for
                    development, on the environment, on refugees — a very sensitive subject in the
                    Middle East because of all of the Palestinians who left the territory — on the
                    economic development of the region, and on security and arms control. These
                    [negotiations] were all held separately — amazingly, in different cities around
                    the world. Our tactic was to involve the world as much as possible in the whole
                    thing. [As a result], we would have arms control and disarmament talks in
                    Moscow; we would have refugee discussions in Canada; we would have the
                    environment discussed in Tokyo; we would have economic development discussed in
                    Paris; and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>That kept everybody very busy and it kept the Israelis extraordinarily busy,
                    because they had to mount delegations for this whole range of talks. They were a
                    participant in every single one. They've done quite a phenomenal job of it.
                    However, it also kept me and my staff very busy, trying to keep in contact, not
                    only with the [Israeli] Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the senior
                    policy makers, but also with all of these delegation heads who were men and
                    women of parts themselves and took a major role in the policy questions. It was
                    a very busy, political job to do all of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: 1992. It was a very hard-fought election. In retrospect, I think that
                    historians will say that that election was decided back in March or April
                    [1992], when the first political primary ever held by a party in Israel took
                    place — in the Labor Party. Yitzhak Rabin won over his longtime rival, Shimon
                    Peres, for leadership of the Labor Party. It was with Rabin that the Labor Party
                    could win, because Israelis tend to be quite conservative on security matters.
                    Although they may be interested, if you can generalize, in a peace process or
                    negotiated peace, but they will resist anything which would appear even remotely
                    to put their security at risk. In Rabin there was the combination of a man who
                    had been a lifelong, professional military officer, who had been chief of staff
                    [of the Israeli Defense Forces] during the Six-Day War in 1967, had been present
                    at the liberation of [East] Jerusalem, was thought of as being a hard headed,
                    tough, military man, but also was interested in land for peace and in
                    negotiations. With someone in whom they could have confidence for the security
                    of the nation at the helm, the [Israeli] people were able to vote for the peace
                    process, which is what they did. They put Likud out of office, and made clear
                    that the Israeli people wanted to have real negotiations.</p>
                <p>At that time, the process had been going on for eight or nine months, since
                    October, 1991, but it had not gone very far because of Likud's actual beliefs
                    and policies. But now [after the elections] the process could begin to move more
                    rapidly. That was a sea change in Israeli politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they trying to drag you in — you, the American

                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>HARROP: Into the campaign? Sure, it came up all the time, but we were able to
                    avoid that pretty well. I think that any career Foreign Service Officer, any
                    diplomat who's been around for a number of years during a political campaign is
                    very sensitive to the importance of trying to keep out. Israel is particularly
                    difficult because [the Israelis] were determined to bring us into it. However,
                    we were able to keep out. In fact, the situation was that each side was sort of
                    campaigning against the United States. It was peculiar, but that happens from
                    time to time, as you know. I think that the Embassy was able to emerge unscathed
                    on the issue of partisanship.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: The so-called Dotan Affair. Yes. I don't want to spend much time on this,
                    but for the past seven years there has been about $1.8 billion of defense
                    equipment procurement per year by Israel using American grant aid. Israel has
                    purchased squadrons of American aircraft, patrol boats, and all kinds of
                    military equipment in the United States. They have had — unique among the
                    beneficiaries of American defense support — their own, very large purchasing
                    office, with scores of people employed, in New York, which undertakes this
                    procurement, rather than having the [U.S.] Department of Defense do it on their
                    behalf. They do this rather skillfully. They are rather good at getting
                    competitive bids from American manufacturers — the best price, the best goods,
                    and so forth. From a military engineering point of view they are plain
                    competing. They know what they want and what they need for their theater of war.
                    The “Dotan Affair” refers to General Dotan, who was among those responsible for
                    procurement. He was found to have diverted funds in a deal which included
                    General Electric and other American companies. He was tried, convicted, and sent
                    to jail in Israel. The whole story continued to unfold — particularly on the
                    American side — after that, but there have been no indictments as yet in the
                    United States. However, the Department of Justice [in the U.S.] was and is very
                    much interested in pressing forward with prosecution in America. It wants some
                    good, exemplary convictions in the United States to “nip off” this kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>There was a tremendous need to interview General Dotan and get from him the facts
                    in a deposition which could be used in the American courts. The Israelis were
                    very resistant to allowing Dotan to be interviewed. It became a real “cause
                    celebre.” We spent a lot of time on it, between Department of State and
                    Department of Justice lawyers and the legal advisers of the Defense and Foreign
                    Affairs Ministries in Israel, trying to work this thing out. It may have been
                    concluded by now. Just as I left, four or five months ago, we'd finally reached
                    an agreement on the nature of an interview which could take place.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I think that the Israelis exposed themselves to suspicion by resisting having
                    Dotan interviewed. People from the United States, critics of Israel, could say,
                    “Now, wait a minute, what are they trying to hide? Is there more here than meets
                    the eye?” Others said, “Well, the Israeli reluctance is [based on the
                    consideration that] they don't want to set a precedent for other powers
                    interviewing [Israelis].” Others said, “Well, they [the Israelis] don't want
                    Dotan to have an opportunity to try to involve people as high as he can,
                    including then Minister of Defense Rabin in this matter. Dotan is a very bitter
                    man, understandably. He's going to try to sour Israeli politics.” Anyway, it was
                    rather complicated. It's not over yet.</p>
                <p>The other big effect of the Dotan affair was to have many people in the American
                    Congress look with a skeptical eye upon the existence of this [Israeli]
                    purchasing agency [in New York]. Perhaps purchasing should be done by the
                    Pentagon, in the same way as most other programs are handled. I don't know. The
                    Israelis feel that they can do better by purchasing for themselves, than having
                    the Pentagon do it for them. There is a cost to the [U.S.] taxpayer with all of
                    the paperwork. Actually, there's a cost to the Israeli taxpayer as well, in a
                    sense, since the huge costs of the Pentagon bureaucracy doing the purchasing for
                    Israel is deducted from the grant. I think of this off and on but I don't
                    believe it is a major or enduring issue.</p>
                <p>Before we get into the Rabin administration, the more important thing of this
                    nature, during my first six months [in Israel] were the allegations of diversion
                    of American military technology, particularly to China and to other powers. The
                    Israeli defense industry is a large, complex, and very effective structure. It
                    is largely government-owned, part of the parastatal system. The Israelis have an
                    active military export program. This enables them to lower unit costs of their
                    own equipment, the same as every other nation which exports [military
                    equipment]. This is a major foreign exchange earner for them, and it is also a
                    way for them to fund research and development, which would be more difficult to
                    fund, [if they did not have] the economies of scale and have customers overseas
                    to do the research for them. They are the world leaders in certain areas, such
                    as night vision, and night flying equipment. In some other areas of electronics
                    and avionics they are at the front of technology. In fact, when they purchase
                    American aircraft, such as the F-15 and the F-16, they actually install their
                    own, classified equipment — improvements, if you will — to make these aircraft
                    more adaptable to their own image of what they need to be doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Anyway, the major allegation, which became very public indeed, was that the
                    technology having to do with the famous “Patriot” missile, which had defended
                    Tel Aviv and Haifa during the Gulf War, had been, in fact, “leaked” to China.
                    China is a customer of Israel for defense equipment. This became a very serious
                    matter. American intelligence [information] was sufficiently sobering on the
                    subject that we asked for and obtained Israeli permission to send a special team
                    to Israel to do a thorough investigation. This was done along in March or April,
                    1992. The result was publicly announced that evidence of diversion [of this
                    technology] could not be found. Now, that did not mean that the intelligence
                    information was refuted or brushed aside. There are many people who still feel
                    that there is evidence of some problems in this area, possibly involving the
                    “Patriot” and possibly involving other technology. That is a continuing chancre,
                    a continuing boil that must be lanced. Many Israeli leaders who attach great
                    importance to their relationship with the United States, and are very proud of
                    their own integrity, are extremely bitter that they are suspected [in this
                    connection]. They say, “Why in the world would we divert technology to China or
                    North Korea, which is the charge, which could then be sold back to our enemies
                    here in the Middle East?” They argue that this doesn't make sense.</p>
                <p>Other people in the United States say that we have intelligence information which
                    is just so “hard” that we cannot ignore these things. We know that the Israeli
                    Government may not always completely control the Israeli defense industry, the
                    same way as we know from experience that our government does not always control
                    the American defense industry, and leaks could happen, etc. And so it goes, on
                    and on. Efforts are made to set up systematic reviews, cooperative
                    investigations, or other such things which will put these problems to rest. They
                    will never be entirely put to rest at a time when the world arms industry is in
                    great trouble. Obviously, it's part of our domestic political agenda to deal
                    with the problems which major employers like Lockheed, Boeing, and General
                    Dynamics are having. The same thing, of course, is true in Israel. So pressures
                    become more acute. The search for markets for arms is a big issue. That was and
                    is a troublesome bilateral issue between Israel and the United States.</p>
                <p>When the Rabin Government came into office, they made it very clear that they
                    were determined to move ahead with the peace process. In fact, the Prime
                    Minister announced that within nine months of taking office there would be a
                    deal with the Palestinians. That proved an unwise kind of a statement to make
                    because such announcements inevitably harden your negotiating partner into
                    feeling, that if he stands fast, you are going to give up some of his own
                    positions in order to meet your own deadline of nine months. This statement may
                    even ensure a lack of cooperation from the Palestinian side. There were plenty
                    of other reasons why Rabin was not going to give in to the Palestinians. The
                    legitimacy of the Palestinian negotiating delegation was not a very solid one.
                    They had not been elected or appointed by any real, recognized political force.
                    They were always playing “catch up” and trying to sell themselves to their own
                    constituencies in the Occupied Territories at the same time that they were
                    trying to negotiate against more experienced, more skilled, and better informed
                    Israeli negotiators.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>It was a tough impasse, despite herculean efforts by Prime Minister Rabin and his
                    team. They did step back from the “settlement policy,” although there is still
                    some limited financing of settlements going on — I think more than the Labor
                    Party should be involved in based on its own platform. They could be more
                    forthright on that subject, although they have, by and large, cut back on
                    support of settlements. [Former Housing Minister] Sharon and his friends had
                    made so many commitments and signed so many contracts before they left office.
                    They explicitly and expressly left the maximum amount of ongoing construction in
                    settlement activity. This presented the Labor and Meretz (a Leftist, “Peace Now”
                    party which is the major partner of the government in Israel at the present
                    time) with a great overhang of settlement activity to contend with.</p>
                <p>Anyway, negotiations [with the Arabs] were not going anywhere up until this
                    recent breakthrough in August, 1993, following negotiations in Norway. In
                    August, 1992, I accompanied Prime Minister Rabin to Kennebunkport [ME], to spend
                    a weekend with President Bush and Secretary Baker. On that occasion we had some,
                    I would say, tough but friendly discussions. There was a sense of
                    reestablishment of positive relations between the Israeli Government and the
                    personalities in that government and the United States Government. There was
                    also some very blunt talk about settlements and about what the actual policies
                    were going to be. The end result was what was politically necessary to both
                    sides. The Israeli side agreed to sharply reduce settlement activity, and the
                    American side agreed to go ahead with the large loan guarantee program. This was
                    done, with the proviso, which was very much desired by Senator Leahy as well,
                    that there should be a deduction to reflect settlement construction. Up to $2.0
                    billion would be guaranteed each year for five years for a total of $10.0
                    billion. Each year there would be a close accounting made of what money had been
                    spent the previous year on settlement activities. That amount would be deducted
                    from the amount to be guaranteed in the following year.</p>
                <p>At present, in November, 1993, this is a big, political issue in the Clinton
                    administration, since we have deducted almost one-fourth, almost $470 million,
                    from the $2.0 billion to be guaranteed in 1994. Our estimate is that that amount
                    was spent by the Israeli government [on building settlements in the Occupied
                    Territories] during the first year of the guarantee [1993].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of money committed by the Likud government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, it is mostly because of that, but not entirely. These are
                    complicated, political issues. Many people in the Labor Party also do not want
                    entirely to abandon the notion of settlement construction [in the Occupied
                    Territories]. However, more importantly, Labor has to retain its credibility
                    with the public in security terms if it is going to be reelected. Israel is a
                    very real democracy — no question about it. The relationship of the voter to the
                    government is an ever-important element.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>President Clinton, to my dismay, is now speaking about “forgiving” the $470
                    million or so and allowing it to be guaranteed, despite the fact that that
                    amount of money was spent on settlements. I think that it would be a bad
                    political mistake to do that. I think that the pressure should be kept firmly on
                    the Israeli Government not to engage in settlements. I think that if we are
                    going to have a durable peace in the Middle East, we must really have Israel
                    honestly prepared to trade land for peace. Anyway, that's an issue that's being
                    discussed at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the American election of 1992 impact on Israel and
                        your mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, it impacted on Israel because Israel was a part of the American
                    election. Just as the United States is part of Israeli elections, so Israel is
                    part of American elections. Jews represent about two percent of the American
                    population, or slightly more than five million Jews in this country. It's a
                    matter of great debate and discussion — who is a Jew, as it is a question
                    everywhere. More than most communities in America, the Jewish community votes
                    and is involved politically. American Jews have normally voted for Democratic
                    Party candidates. In the elections of 1992, because, I believe, of the totally
                    misplaced perception that the Bush-Baker administration had not been a good
                    administration for Israel, a crazy perception, in fact, it was clear that the
                    Republicans were not going to do very well among Jewish voters. For that reason
                    [the Republicans] were trying to do all that they could to improve that
                    situation. In October, 1992, first the loan guarantee went through. One could
                    argue, in some respects, that this was related to the American elections, but I
                    think it would have gone through eventually. Then there were other announcements
                    of defense support for Israel, resource transfers, and so forth along in
                    October, 1992. So to that extent Israeli issues were part of the American
                    elections.</p>
                <p>I think that Israelis, by and large, would have preferred to have Clinton win,
                    because they have this notion that Democrats are more friendly to them. However,
                    I think that they're mistaken. You have a lot of rhetoric from the Democratic
                    Party side and you may have a little more money change hands, but pursuit of the
                    peace process was not really an issue in the American election campaign. This
                    was a national concern. Sympathy for Israel is really not an issue in American
                    politics. It may be that we give $3.0-4.0 billion in support to Israel. We
                    definitely give $3.0 billion and how much of the rest is taxpayer money is a
                    matter for debate. The polls in this country have repeatedly shown that it is
                    not just the five-plus million American Jews who favor that. A majority of the
                    American people strongly supports the independence of a democratic Israel, and a
                    two-thirds majority of Americans over and over again have approved of these very
                    large resource transfers to Israel. So it's a national attitude. It's not a
                    question in American politics, whether or not we're going to support Israel.
                    We're going to support both the existence and independence of Israel and the
                    peace process.</p>
                <p>I think that there is a perception that the bilateral relationship has a greater
                    influence on elections than, in fact, is the case.</p>

                        he assumed office, were you feeling noises from the transition team that we
                        have to do things differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: No, I don't think so. There was a great effort being made by the
                    transition team to make clear that, in fact, our policies were not going to
                    change, and particularly our dedication to the peace process and our attention
                    to it. It was difficult for me to imagine that any Secretary of State could
                    spend the proportion of his time on this particular issue that Secretary of
                    State Baker had spent on it. It just seemed impossible for him to do that. For
                    example, they made clear that they were going to keep Djerejian in office as
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. They appointed Sam Lewis,
                    a well-known Israel supporter, to be Director of Policy Planning [in the
                    Department of State]. They appointed Martin Indyk, a former executive of AIPAC
                    and director of AIPAC's offshoot, a think tank public policy foundation called
                    the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, as the National Security
                    Council's man for the Middle East. So it was clear that they were going to
                    continue in the same direction. In fact, the first overseas trip which Secretary
                    of State Christopher made was to Israel. His first stop was Israel. He made the
                    usual circuit to Cairo, Amman, Damascus, and, for the first time, he even went
                    to Lebanon, which was regarded as rather daring, from the security point of
                    view. That was in March, 1993. No, there was no sense of change. At that time
                    the Norway talks were not really getting anywhere...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Palestinians and [officials of the] Israeli Foreign Ministry.
                    Interestingly enough, it was the Foreign Ministry, because the rivalry between
                    Peres as Foreign Minister and Rabin as Prime Minister has never stopped. This
                    rivalry has come as near to stopping as it has in the past — right now — because
                    Peres was the architect of this relationship with the PLO. Rabin saw that he had
                    to go along with that — indeed, wanted to go along with that. Rabin did a
                    complete reversal of his policy toward the PLO. He recognized the PLO. He made
                    that move. I think that he saw that the only way he was going to get the peace
                    process going was to do that, since without an interlocuteur valable, he wasn't
                    going to be able to make progress. It was clear that, whatever you might think
                    of the PLO, they were the nearest thing to a valid negotiating partner,
                    particularly when it became increasingly apparent that Israel and the PLO had a
                    number of common concerns.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Most of the Arab governments were concerned by the threat of the Islamic
                    fundamentalists in the Middle East. Peres told me shortly before I left [the
                    Embassy in Tel Aviv] at the beginning of May, 1993, that there were talks going
                    on in Norway. We knew that, I guess, but he didn't give me the impression that
                    he thought that they were going to “break through” any more than had a series of
                    other, secret meetings that had been arranged in various locations between
                    Palestinians and Israelis. All of a sudden, during the summer of 1993 that
                    meeting [in Norway] began to acquire substance. Both teams decided that they
                    really were going to make progress, and that's the way it came out. Rabin had
                    been through a difficult spell before that. The American Ambassador was forever
                    calling in to plea for moderation in response to terrorist actions.</p>
                <p>There always are incursions from Lebanon down into Israel in the form of Katusha
                    rockets fired at Israeli towns. There are frequent armed attacks against Israeli
                    forces by units of Hezbollah, the extremist Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group
                    in southern Lebanon, which is supported and financed by Iran and operates with
                    the quiet concurrence of the Syrian Government. Israel has occupied that five or
                    eight mile wide security zone in Southern Lebanon to protect itself from these
                    incursions. Whenever these rockets blast into Israel and kill Israelis in Kiryat
                    Sh'mona and other towns in Northern Israel or, and this is a bit more
                    questionable from an ethical point of view, when Israeli forces in the security
                    zone are attacked by the Hezbollah, Israel tends to retaliate with great vigor.
                    Then the American Ambassador finds himself preaching forbearance, trying to
                    limit the retaliation. My colleague in Damascus [at the time], Ambassador Chris
                    Ross, would go to the Syrians and say, “Please use what influence you can with
                    the Hezbollah.” I would speak to the Israelis to try to prevent all of this
                    conflict from interfering with the peace process, which was in everybody's
                    interest.</p>
                <p>Then the most dramatic event of all, of course, was the second visit of Prime
                    Minister Rabin to Washington. I was in Washington in March, 1993 — I guess
                    Christopher's visit [to Israel] must have been in February, 1993. Rabin came to
                    Washington in March. There were some particularly bloody murders of Israeli
                    military and civilians in Israel proper by “Hamas,” the extremist counterpart of
                    Hezbollah in the Occupied Territories. Rabin cut short his visit, in fact, and
                    went back to Israel because there was such public concern at home. At that time
                    he closed off the Occupied Territories — sealing off the “Green Line,” the
                    border between Israel and both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. He did not
                    allow Palestinians who worked in Israel — about 70,000-80,000 in number — to
                    come over to their jobs. That gave the Israeli public a sense of greater
                    security, with fewer Palestinians present. Also, I think, this contributed to
                    the peace process because many Israelis began to see that they could really live
                    pretty well with that line closed off. They derived a certain encouragement from
                    that.</p>
                <p>There had also been the very dramatic deportation of 415 supposedly Hamas leaders
                    in December 1992. They were selected with such speed that not all the right ones
                    were chosen. In fact, some of them were released shortly afterwards because they
                    were not involved with Hamas. The deportation was in retaliation for more Hamas
                    killing of Israelis.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>That led to the most difficult negotiation I had when I was in Israel, which was
                    on behalf of Secretary of State Christopher. I met with Prime Minister Rabin
                    seven times in five days. I made a note of this. I must write it up some time,
                    since it was so interesting. [I met with Rabin] to negotiate a confidential
                    agreement between the United States and Israel on how the Israelis would behave
                    in regard to these deported Palestinians. This agreement made it possible for us
                    to maintain our support for Israel in the United Nations, where deportation was
                    a major issue because...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was a very difficult negotiation and one which I was pleased with. I
                    think that Prime Minister Rabin was also pleased, because we were able to reach
                    an understanding which bridged a very real difference between the United States
                    and Israel. Deportation under international law, is a very harsh and politically
                    repugnant move. We were able to get by that. In fact, the last of these
                    deportees will be returned [to Israel or the Occupied Territories] in a matter
                    of a very few days. In December, 1993, the last ones will be sent back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the dynamics of the relationship
                        between Clinton, the Clinton administration, and Christopher with the
                        Israeli Government? Did you see a change between that and the Bush-Baker
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Not very great, because they had made such a point of keeping people on.
                    I think that it took a while for Christopher to develop confidence. The
                    [Israelis] knew Baker awfully well. Not just the people in the Likud Party but
                    also the Labor Party people. They met with Baker and knew him very well,
                    understood what his thinking was, how his mind worked, and what he was trying to
                    achieve. After January 1993 there was a certain disarray, as there always is
                    when a new administration comes into office. Christopher is a dramatically
                    different sort of person, reserved, seemingly closed. He is not warm, does not
                    tell jokes, does not have that kind of human rapport which Baker established
                    very quickly with [the Israelis]. I think that they were a little tentative [in
                    their contacts with him]. On the other hand, I felt that in the Clinton
                    administration they had people who would do almost anything for them, as had
                    been repeatedly made clear. The new Administration was determined to be
                    perceived as pro-Israeli and to make that the tenet of its policies.</p>
                <p>The relationship picked up fairly quickly. Mr. Christopher had a successful visit
                    to Israel in February, 1993. I guess that we had four meetings with Prime
                    Minister Rabin, two of which were one-on-one meetings between Christopher and
                    Rabin, and two — one a luncheon and one a larger meeting — all went pretty
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Toward the end [of my tour in Israel] I was engaged in economic issues, because I
                    felt it was so important that something be done about the liberalization of the
                    Israeli economy. Investment was not going to be attracted to that economy unless
                    they took further steps to deregulate foreign exchange and capital markets, to
                    simplify licensing and labor regulations, to privatize the 4% of the economy
                    still in Government or Labor Union hands. I had discussed these matters with the
                    Israelis and, in fact, was able to persuade both Mr. Baker in August, 1992, and
                    Mr. Christopher in February, 1993, during their visits while I was there, to
                    raise the subject of privatization and liberalization of the [Israeli] economy.
                    It's one issue on which the American Congress has been ahead of the Executive
                    Branch. Many of the Congressional leaders and even many of those who are the
                    best friends of Israel are quite concerned about this matter. I tried to work on
                    that with them, along with other Israeli leaders. The Israeli Government itself
                    is interested in doing this, but the political obstacles in the Israeli system,
                    as in any other — political obstacles to privatization and taking these measures
                    — are very difficult. There are always vested interests howling to be heard when
                    you make these changes.</p>
                <p>In fact, the supposed reason why I was replaced [in Israel], and rather abruptly,
                    was a speech that I gave in March, 1993, to the combined Rotary Clubs of Tel
                    Aviv on the economy and economic reform in Israel. In this speech I stated,
                    among other things, that in the course of recent visits to Israel, Senator
                    Inouye and Senator Leahy had each stated that it was going to be difficult,
                    given the end of the Cold War, given the American budgetary deficit, and the
                    shrinkage of the American presence overseas generally, to maintain for very much
                    longer the very high level of resource transfers to Israel. I mentioned their
                    comments in passing as a further reason why there should be more attention paid
                    to liberalizing the economy, so that growth could be maintained and more jobs
                    created without dependence on American largesse to do it. American grant aid
                    represented about 7-8% of the Israeli budget. I pointed out that, in my view, it
                    was not prudent for any government to rely — even on its staunchest friend — for
                    that proportion of its national budget.</p>
                <p>These remarks brought a great cacophony of criticism and, I think, a somewhat
                    hypocritical outburst in Washington, in the Congress and on the part of the
                    press spokesman of the Department of State. I was removed very quickly but I
                    think it was not really for that reason.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think was the reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I think there was a perception that I was maybe a little too much of a
                    player myself in the affair and that I spoke too much to people, to the press,
                    and to others in Israel. I had not, perhaps — I guess the term is — “gone
                    native” to quite the extent that some of my predecessors had in Israel. I was
                    perhaps not seen by the [Clinton] administration as someone whose every
                    automatic instinct was going to be to support Israel.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I don't really know. I was rather hurt, I must say, by the attitude of
                    Secretary Christopher, whom I'd regarded as a friend. I'd worked with him. I was
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary for Africa when he was last in the Department of
                    State, and I'd worked quite closely with him on a number of human rights issues.
                    I was hurt that he never spoke with me at all and never discussed with me why I
                    was being withdrawn. There was no communication of any kind. I was informed that
                    I was to leave very quickly by Peter Tarnoff, who also did not discuss the
                    rationale...</p>

                    it's not unusual in a country of that sensitivity for a new Administration to
                    want to have a change. So now they will send [Edward] Djerejian, the Assistant
                    Secretary [for Near East Affairs] to Israel as Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure that one goes through a certain amount of
                        introspection and thinking about this. Did any of this come from the Israeli
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: I do not believe so. I do not believe that it came from the Israeli side,
                    and I do not believe that it came from the American Jewish community. I'm fairly
                    confident of the latter. I had confidence in these people, I think that they had
                    confidence in me, and I don't believe that that was the case. On the Israeli
                    side I know that my friend, the Governor of the Central Bank, a little bit
                    before this, had mentioned when he was in Washington that he hoped that I would
                    not press too urgently for privatization of the banks, though he and I had, in
                    fact, been coordinating closely on economic reform. He wanted to delay
                    privatization of certain banks for technical reasons related to changing their
                    structure. Whether a comment of that sort had an effect, I don't know. I'm sure
                    that he did not mean it to have the effect of hurrying my departure.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I don't believe that it was from the Israeli side. It was from the [Clinton]
                    administration itself. I think that it was [Secretary of State] Christopher. It
                    was people right around him — very likely, Dennis Ross, who had no particular
                    affection for me. What others? I won't mention other names. I don't know who it
                    was, or to what extent it was “ad hominem.” I'll probably never know exactly
                    what happened.</p>

                        leaves the impression...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: It was a little difficult, and I've had a difficult summer. I haven't
                    gone back and really engaged in things at the Department of State. It seemed to
                    me that after 39 years of service in this system and rising to the top of it — I
                    guess I was the fourth most senior Foreign Service Officer in the government
                    when I retired in May, 1993. I was the most senior Career Minister. You know, I
                    was hurt by it. I was hurt particularly by the fact, the rather pointed fact,
                    that the administration recalled from retirement and sent back as a temporary
                    “fill in” the officer who had been my immediate predecessor, Bill Brown. But
                    that also, I think, made a point regarding the nature of their concern, since
                    Bill Brown was seen as just a 100 percent, pro-Israeli figure. He's almost,
                    really — he left Israel to state publicly that he thought that we should not
                    combine humanitarian and political issues over the loan guarantees, at the time
                    that the government was still doing that strongly. He's a member of boards of
                    directors of Israeli banks, he's the Chairman of the Truman Institute of the
                    Hebrew University, and he is thoroughly pro-Israeli and very concerned about
                    Israel. I think that, maybe, that was a point that they wanted to make. They
                    wanted someone who just did not have any reserves at all about total, even
                    uncritical American support for Israel.</p>
                <p>I think that it was probably known that I had certain reserves, as I did, about
                    the advisability of our continuing current high levels of grant economic aid —
                    not the security assistance, which is essential to reassure the Israeli public
                    that they can take some chances in the peace process. But I think that at a time
                    when we cannot afford essential programs at home, and cannot give any aid to
                    poor peoples we'd like to help around the world, it is difficult to justify
                    allocating over one half of all our aid grants to a relatively prosperous
                    country with a growth rate — at this time — three times our own. I don't think
                    that it is any secret that I had doubts about our continuing the $1.2 billion of
                    grant economic aid, among other reasons because I think that it is not in
                    Israel's own interest. It is used as a cushion which saves them from taking the
                    hard decisions to reform their own economy, improve their economic
                    circumstances, and attract investment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One can understand the political side — making this type
                        of decision. Fair enough, we're all creatures of this. But you have been
                        very much concerned with the professionalism of the Foreign Service, in a
                        whole series of capacities. It sounds as if you know that you should have
                        stayed on in the Service — but the reaction of what you might call the
                        professional part of the Department was, “Well, you're out and
                        Sayonara.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: You know, the Department of State and the Foreign Service have never
                    known how to treat their senior people. I remember, 20 years ago, that a dear,
                    respected friend of mine, H. Freeman Matthews, Sr. — “Doc” Matthews — was
                    retiring after being the first Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs,
                    and on the first list ever promoted to Career Ambassador. I met him in the
                    Department. I saw him in that second corridor on the “C” Street side, where the
                    Personnel area, the Foreign Service Lounge, the Leave and Retirement Office, and
                    Accounts are located. He was walking around all alone, a little dazed. I said,
                    “Ambassador Matthews, how are you? What are you doing?” He answered, “Well, I'm
                    trying to retire. I'm going around here. I've got to find a Mrs. So-and-so. What
                    is 'PT4L2'? I've got all these papers to sign, and I don't know where to take
                    them.” He was wandering about. No one was helping him, no one was advising
                    him.</p>
                <p>I had so much that same sense at the end of May, 1993, when I returned from Tel
                    Aviv to Washington, a feeling of deja vu from the time I ran into Doc Matthews.
                    You know, you're just another nameless bureaucrat as you leave the Foreign
                    Service. You walk around, trying to calculate what your annuity is supposed to
                    be and sign the right papers. I had to go out and buy my own passport
                    photographs for something — I've forgotten what it was. Anyway, the whole thing
                    was a sense of not really being much of a respected part of an institution
                    which, you felt, had been your whole life for 40 years. It's an interesting
                    phenomenon. I think that many people feel this. I don't think that I'm about to
                    attend the semi-annual retirement party that Warren Christopher gives for
                    retired Foreign Service Officers. He did not have the grace to tell me why he
                    was retiring me. I feel — I would not say bitterness — but disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that, unfortunately, in a way this is what this
                        whole oral history project is about, among other things. I think that there
                        are recollections of careers which are worth preserving, there are lessons
                        to be learned, there is respect which is due...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HARROP: Well, who can talk about “I want respect”? That sounds like the comedian
                    [Rodney Dangerfield] who says, “I don't get no respect.” It is a poignant moment
                    in a man's life to end a 40-year career. You just feel completely isolated,
                    alone, and rather forlorn, walking around and slipping away. You hand in your
                    identity card and slip out the side door for the last time you'll be in the
                    Department. It's a rather difficult experience, which everyone must go
                    through.</p>
