                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you go by Edmund, by Ed, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Actually, I go by Edmund and that's for a very practical reason. For many
                    years I was introduced to people as edul and I found that no one had a chance to
                    grasp the names when it came that briefly. So I adopted Edmund to give people a
                    pause, Edmund ... Hull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was born February 12, 1949 in Keokuk, Iowa which is a town on the
                    Mississippi River. My parents were actually living in Carthage, Illinois, but
                    Carthage had no hospital. When my mother was ready to deliver they had to cross
                    the Mississippi and so technically, I'm an Iowan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born on Lincoln's birthday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was born on Lincoln's birthday and grew up primarily in Springfield,
                    Illinois which was Lincoln's home town, which meant that I never went to school
                    on my birthday. For the first fifteen years of my life I had a chocolate cake in
                    the shape of a log cabin every birthday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about your parents? Let's take your
                        father's side. Where did Mr. Hull come from and that side of the
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My father, Thomas F. Hull was born in Burnside, Illinois which is a very
                    small town in West Central Illinois. He had an all-American, Tom Sawyer-type
                    life in Burnside. He was a very gifted athlete and eventually was recruited for
                    a high school team in Quincy and then to the University of Illinois and lettered
                    in baseball at the University of Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the family come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Hulls, we can trace back to about 1500. They came from England, the
                    paternal line. The first Hull that was recorded in the early sixteenth century
                    was a miller and had a mill that was taxed by the English crown. That's how they
                    entered in the history books because of the taxation of that mill. One of the
                    prominent ancestors Reverend Joseph Hull was born in the seventeenth century,
                    went to Oxford, became a minister, a protestant minister, and actually led a
                    group of Pilgrims to the United States. They left from Weymouth, county Dorset
                    and landed on March 6, 1635 in Boston, Massachusetts. There's a lot of history
                    for the succeeding fifteen generations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say your grandparents. Where did they appear on your
                        father's side? Were they in Illinois?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The early generations were in New England, and as best I can tell whenever
                    a new territory was opened up for settlement some of the Hulls moved into that
                    new territory. For example, from the Massachusetts Bay Colony there was a
                    movement down to New Jersey when it was becoming a state. Several generations of
                    Hulls lived in New Jersey. There was a judge, there was a sheriff and
                    eventually, a generation moved to the Cumberland area of what was then Virginia
                    and is now West Virginia. One generation was on the frontier there in
                    Cumberland. I imagine the land there was rather poor and so when the further
                    west opened uI believe it was Jacob Hull in the early nineteenth century moved
                    out to West Central Illinois and there's actually a town in West Central
                    Illinois called Hull. He established the family there in Illinois. My
                    great-grandfather William Henry Hull moved to Pilot Grove, Illinois and he's
                    buried there. Pilot Grove with the coming of the railroad shifted a few miles
                    and became Burnside, Illinois. Burnside, Illinois is where my great-grandfather
                    Edgar and my grandfather Fred P. Hull grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your grandfather, your grandparents on your
                        father's side. What was his business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Fred P. Hull ran the general store in Burnside, and he was also postmaster
                    of Burnside. He also wrote a column in the local newspaper about news in
                    Burnside and ended up writing a history of the county. He was a local figure,
                    very well known, very opinionated and very articulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your father; what type of business did your
                        father get involved in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HULL: After my father graduated from the University of Illinois he was in the
                    army, this was during World War II. He was in Kansas, at Fort Leavenworth and
                    technically he was in the U.S. Army Cavalry. He was a trainer, he was training
                    people for World War II. After he left the U.S. Army he became an insurance
                    agent for the Equitable Life Assurance Society because his brother-in-law had
                    followed that profession and helped him get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My mother was Lorene Ellen Fruin, and the Fruins emigrated from Ireland,
                    from Tipperary, to America in the nineteenth century, I believe, as part of the
                    immigration spurred by the potato famine. They came and settled in northern
                    Illinois around Gilman. On one side it was Fruins, and on one side it was
                    Brady's. The Brady's were entrepreneurial, and one of the ancestors actually
                    went west and settled for a time in Denver, built one of the first houses ever
                    built in Denver, Colorado, made a respectable amount of money mining gold, came
                    back and took that gold and purchased farm land in northern Illinois. They set
                    up the Fruins as farmers in northern Illinois. My grandfather was not only a
                    farmer, but also one of the original agents of State Farm Insurance Society.
                    That was Frank Fruin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My mother also graduated from the University of Illinois and her father,
                    Frank, was very much dedicated to education and made sure that all of his
                    children received college educations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What field was your mother studying, do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think she was having a lot of fun. The academic portion of her studies
                    was rather generalized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were both at the University of Illinois. My father was a varsity
                    athlete and my mother was in a sorority and a very social gal, very, very good
                    looking, both of them. I think one of their friends made the match for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They settled where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HULL: Initially, my mother followed my father out to Kansas. They weren't married
                    at the time, but they got married very shortly thereafter. I think their entire
                    wedding cost about $22.00. My mother kept the receipt for the wedding breakfast
                    which was the main celebration. I think it was about six or seven dollars, so it
                    was wartime and people made the adjustments and life went on. They spent a
                    period of time, a couple of years, at Fort Leavenworth, and then when my father
                    left the military they came back to Illinois, to West Central Illinois where he
                    had grown up and established themselves there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You grew up where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I grew up primarily in Springfield, Illinois. We moved there when I was
                    about nine years old. I stayed there until I graduated from high school and went
                    to the East Coast to university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the mid fifties, I guess? What was Springfield
                        like then for a boy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was saturated with Lincoln lore. You kind of lived and breathed and just
                    imbibed that history of the United States. We made the obligatory and sometimes
                    not obligatory trips to the Lincoln shrines: his house in Springfield, the
                    courthouse, his tomb. His presence of course, was also very prevalent in the
                    schools. That I think was a dominant feature of growing up in Springfield. I
                    think the other significant thing for me was it was an all-American town. We had
                    very little supervision growing up. I have ten siblings and so my parents were
                    limited in what they could do in that department. My mother assigned each of us
                    a guardian angel and we pretty much went our own ways and lived very freely. My
                    father with his eleven children strongly encouraged us all to work and gain an
                    income, so all of the boys started out in paper routes from about the fifth
                    grade when you are about ten years old. We had those paper routes, morning paper
                    routes, that entailed getting up about 5:30 and doing our runs before school. We
                    kept those until high school and that's how we paid for our extras and that's
                    how we paid tuition to high school, in fact. I think that was a very good
                    experience for me, increased my sense of independence and gave me a very keen
                    appreciation of the value of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were one of ten?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was one of twelve, but the last daughter, Christine died as an
                    infant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you rank in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was the fourth from the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family, where did they fall politically ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My grandfather, Fred P. Hull, was fairly active politically and very much a
                    Democrat. My parents grew up during the Great Depression, and they were most
                    impressed by FDR and I think felt his approach to government had a certain
                    amount of compassion that they greatly admired. They had seen the effects of it
                    firsthand as they were growing up. So they were lifelong Democrats. My mother
                    was strongly opinionated and more active than my father. We had that sense of
                    New Deal politics from our early childhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Religion, where did your family on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Staunch Catholics, hence the twelve children. My mother said that when they
                    were counseled by the priest upon marriage, the priest said the Lord will take
                    care of the birth control. And my mother went along with that until she had her
                    twelfth child, and then she decided that maybe the Lord didn't give her enough
                    attention, and she decided to take care of it herself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Catholic was your family growing up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was very Catholic. We went to Catholic schools The experience with the
                    nuns and the brothers and the priests was our educational experience through
                    high school. Not daily mass but certainly more than once a week. We were all
                    encouraged to see if we had vocations and in fact both my older brother and I
                    went to the seminary out of high school but neither of us stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Catholic school. I assume at that time the
                        elementary school was run by nuns, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, Ursuline nuns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it? One hears the good side and the bad
                        side, but everybody has a strong feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We certainly got a first-rate education. There was no question about
                    discipline in the classroom, there was no question about challenging studies,
                    and they were on the whole very good teachers. They also were very strong
                    disciplinarians and with the education and the religion came a very powerful
                    sense of sin, of guilt, which I think were more problematic to someone growing
                    up.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I still recall when I was in the sixth grade we were going out to recess, and I
                    had to use the restroom as we were going out. I came out and I was smiling for
                    some reason. One of the nuns was suspicious immediately and took me aside and
                    asked me what had happened. I said nothing and she insisted, “Tell me what has
                    happened.” I said, “Nothing.” She said, “Tell me. So I complied and said:
                    “Something has happened.” She said, “What was that?” “Nothing,” I said,
                    reverting to the truth. So we lived under close supervision. On balance, I think
                    there was much to be gained from the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there boys and girls in the class or was it
                        separated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: In elementary school it was coeducational; in high school it was
                    separate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any subject particularly interest you and others not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was good at everything. I was kind of the academic star in the family and
                    got a lot of positive reinforcement from my parents who followed these things
                    closely, a lot of positive reinforcement from the nuns. I was the one who won
                    the holy card when it was put up as a prize and that positive reinforcement, I
                    think, just encouraged me to work harder and harder at studies, and I could do
                    it across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, a lot of reading, especially things like the Hardy Boys and Tom Swift
                    and the Black Stallion and literature for young boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about sports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My older brother was the athlete of the family. It was pretty hard to
                    measure up to him. Whereas he would play on all the organized teams, my sports
                    career was limited to more informal, pickup sports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home in those days I imagine your parents had quite a
                        job organizing the family. Around the table was there much discussion about
                        what was happening in the world and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HULL: The important thing around the table was getting your fair share of the
                    food. I'm not saying that we ever went wanting, but you were pretty focused on
                    the meal. In addition, to that my Dad every once in a while would decide that
                    there was a manners lesson that was needed, and we would be subjected to an
                    intense explanation of proper form for eating soup. We really didn't get into
                    current events or politics or things of that ilk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the high school you went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was Griffin High School in Springfield, Illinois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was run by whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was run by the Viatorians, a teaching order, and we had very, very,
                    very fine teachers, some of whom had PhDs and were teaching in high school. All,
                    with few exceptions, quite qualified to teach their subjects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the Viatorians fall within the various
                        teachings? I never heard of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It's a small order that really concentrates on teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a male order, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't it the same discipline that you got from the nuns
                        or was it different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was consistent with the earlier discipline and again we had no problems
                    in the classroom or generally in the school. They ran a very taut ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, what sort of things did you get involved
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HULL: I got involved big time in student government, was sophomore class
                    president, on the student council and then I became the president of the
                    inter-city student council which was a council of student councils in
                    Springfield, and I held that position for two years which gave me a little bit
                    of recognition. We had a computer club, one of the first computer clubs, I think
                    ever formed. We had a big Allis Chalmers factory that had computers, and my
                    physics and math teachers arranged for us to use the computer at Allis Chalmers.
                    I've often thought there was a path not traveled had I gone into computers. I
                    was very keen on math and physics. I had very, very good teachers in those
                    fields. I was very good at Latin and won some competitions in that area. I was
                    very strong generally in math and science, a little less strong in the area of
                    English and social sciences where I gravitated eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time did you find yourself involved, as an
                        observer obviously, in the election of President Kennedy? Was this a big
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My first political memory, I think was Kennedy's concession speech to Estes
                    Kefauver, who ran with Adlai Stevenson's in 1956, and the grace with which that
                    was made. It was a coincidence that I happened to be watching television at my
                    grandparents' house. It was black and white, I remember, and this young man came
                    on and very graciously conceded and then of course, four years later came back
                    quite dynamically and ran a successful campaign for President. I think somewhat
                    naively at the time we saw Kennedy with a burst of vigor, freshness against the
                    grayness of the Eisenhower era. We followed what he had to say in his inaugural
                    about “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your
                    country.” I think we were invigorated by his approach and the reception that he
                    received around the world. Camelot was a long way away on the Potomac, but we
                    were aware of it and I think we fell under its mystery. Like most people of my
                    age, I vividly recall what I was doing when he was assassinated, going into the
                    school and being told by a brother that the president had been shot and followed
                    all the ensuing events on television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a strong identification with him as a
                        Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. I think we were proud that a Catholic could be elected President, and
                    he was putting behind the community that particular bugaboo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find during this period from both sides, from the
                        Protestant side and from the Catholic side a divide? I remember when I was a
                        kid if you went out with a Catholic girl you might marry her and then the
                        kids had to be brought up as Catholics. This was “a bad thing.” I'm sure it
                        was true on the other side. Did you run across that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes, it was just remarkable the extent to which our world was homogenous.
                    Protestants were seen as quite a different breed, not to mention Jews or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't even considered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Even farther beyond. I remember my older brother actually dated a
                    Protestant girl from Springfield High School. We were scandalized that he would
                    go outside his faith even in dating. Yes, it was a special little
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dating and all that? Was this much of a thing
                        when you were in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I wasn't socially adept. But the nuns had a lot of girls at the girls'
                    academies, Sacred Heart and Ursuline, who needed dates and my sisters were
                    attending Sacred Heart, so I was drafted into being a partner for a number of
                    the girls at the proms. I was slow in this area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say that you and your brother both went to at
                        different times to seminary? Did you feel that you were called for a while
                        or was this an exploratory thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think our parents in many, many ways conveyed a sense that this was the
                    highest calling, and of course, it was reinforced by the nuns and the priests so
                    for a smart Catholic boy at that time it was kind of a natural channel. My
                    brother went to Maryknoll and stayed four years and I went to a Paulist Seminary
                    in Baltimore and after about six months realized it wasn't for me and then left
                    after the first year. That seminary, Saint Peter's, was a junior college and had
                    26 students in it. I think at the time we were the smallest accredited
                    institution of higher education in the country. It went out of existence the
                    following year, and I shifted my attention to Princeton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made you feel that you didn't have a calling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, I think there were a couple of factors, three factors. One was once
                    you actually got into the theology, and you were kind of being taken behind the
                    curtain you understood that you weren't meant to take literally the articles of
                    faith or the Bible stories. That was somewhat of a shock to an admittedly naive
                    person like myself, that these were allegorical, and we really didn't mean what
                    we said about these things. Secondly, I came into contact with a lot of older
                    priests who didn't seem very well adjusted and seemed in ways bitter and their
                    lives hadn't really turned out that well. Some of them were prone to alcoholism
                    or other socially strange behavior, so seeing it up close and being able to
                    project where this was taking me gave me a great deal of pause. The third thing
                    was I discovered I missed female company. I wasn't willing to give that up in
                    the way the Church required it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us up until about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was 1967 to 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, did the outside world intrude on
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, at Saint Peter's we were in Baltimore and this was when Martin Luther
                    King was assassinated. We could look up and see Baltimore burning. Yes, the
                    outside world was very pressing. And, of course, it was the Vietnam era and as
                    young men, we were subject to the draft and so therefore that was also a very
                    pressing matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself interested in foreign affairs? We
                        had the Cold War going on and other things like that. Was that something
                        that you looked at much or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Not yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Was the farthest thing from my mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened? You finished up your year at Saint
                        Peter's and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HULL: Saint Peter's was closing and I was moving on in any case. I had to choose
                    another college. When I was in Springfield I had worked for the Illinois State
                    Journal, the daily newspaper, for maybe two or three summers. I guess I started
                    my senior year. I had met there Nick Penniman who was it that time the business
                    manager and who would later become publisher of a number of papers including the
                    Saint Louis Post Dispatch. Nick Penniman kind of took me under his wing on the
                    job at the newspaper. He had gone to Princeton, and we had talked about his
                    experience at Princeton. That and the fact that Bill Bradley was doing his
                    heroics on the basketball court made Princeton seem like a very interesting
                    prospect to me. So I visited it, loved the campus. It had everything that Saint
                    Peter's did not have in terms of intellectual fire power and a beautiful college
                    setting. I made an application to transfer, and I didn't realize at the time
                    that transferring to a place like Princeton was extremely difficult because of
                    course, very few of their students fail and so they don't have very many slots
                    after the freshman class has been taken in. I was blessedly naive in all of this
                    and went ahead and applied for transfer, got an interview and it may have been
                    that they had an unfilled category for former seminarians. I'm not quite sure
                    what was the reason, but they agreed to take me so I entered Princeton as a
                    sophomore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at Princeton from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: 1968 to 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Princeton was overwhelming. You came into contact with brilliant minds and
                    your fellow students were extremely smart. There was an immediate adjustment
                    from your having been the big fish in a small pond to being a small fish in an
                    intellectually very big pond indeed. That took some adjustment, and I didn't
                    really know what I wanted to study. I initially made the mistake of trying to do
                    too much and overloaded myself and thankfully was able to shed some courses and
                    get my feet on the ground. Because I was not really tightly focused, the Woodrow
                    Wilson School of Public and International Affairs appealed to me as a major
                    because I could study history, economics, politics and sociology, and I didn't
                    have to choose. So that's what I selected as my major when I went into my junior
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the eating club system? How did that fit in
                        because I am not sure how that works?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. You bicker I think in your freshman year. My generation at Princeton
                    was the SDS generation, and it was coming in the wake of free speech movement in
                    Berkeley, and the takeover of the administrative buildings at Columbia. We were
                    at this stage politically spun up and almost anything traditional including the
                    eating clubs was rejected simply because it was traditional. I never even
                    thought about going that route, it was just too staid, too clubby and so I
                    joined the newly formed Woodrow Wilson College, and I took that avenue.
                    Ironically, this was what Woodrow Wilson as president of Princeton wanted. He
                    wanted to do away with the eating clubs and organize social life in the form of
                    colleges much along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge. Many, many years after he
                    failed in that attempt, Princeton has come back to his idea and Wilson College
                    is one of the first colleges set up to that end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a social divide between the eating club group
                        and the non-eating club group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Probably, but I was not aware of it, and the mood at the time was so
                    radical and politicized, I believe the people on the eating club side of that
                    divide were somewhat on the defensive and really adopted a fairly low
                    profile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this radicalism that was going on in the campus at
                        that time affect the teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: In some ways not greatly. For example, my favorite courses were philosophy.
                    There was a particular professor there, Walter Kaufman, who was a scholar of
                    Nietzsche and existentialism who gave a number of courses which still are
                    touchstones of my life. Other prominent teachers like Marian Levy in sociology
                    were quite conservative. There was a lot of brilliant work and teaching going on
                    including by Manfred Halpern, a politics professor with whom I worked as a
                    research assistant. But by the same token events occurred, particularly Nixon's
                    decision to invade Cambodia in the spring of 1970, which caused academia to come
                    to a complete halt. We, with the support of the faculty, stopped classes
                    altogether, stopped work on papers, didn't take exams. There was a strike and it
                    was not just the students, the faculty was as engaged as the students. We went
                    off to such places as Washington for marches, and we spent that spring doing
                    politics. I remember one of the initiatives at Princeton, which spread
                    nationwide, was an effort to elect a new Congress, because it was felt that only
                    Congress could curb the Executive and its expansion of the war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>That summer I went to France. I was studying French and had a chance to go work
                    in France, and I did so. I came back my senior year to the rude awakening that
                    all of the work from our junior year was going to be made up before we started
                    on our senior obligations which were heavy anyway. So the senior year became a
                    crushing burden of finishing the junior year and moving on and doing the senior
                    thesis that was associated with being a senior at Princeton.</p>

                        pretty well, as far as, all right we're opposed to the war but at the same
                        time there is an education to be gotten.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. We were told the credibility of Princeton and the credibility of the
                    anti-war movement both required that all academic work be done.</p>
                <p>

                        What were you picking up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, although I was outside of Paris in Brittany, but certainly we were
                    aware of Daniel Cohn-Bendit and the highly politicized European scene. It didn't
                    impinge on me personally. That was also the summer of the moon landing and
                    American prestige was high. We were admired for that although we were criticized
                    for Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did going to France whet any appetite for foreign

                </p>
                <p>HULL: That was the beginning. I'm sure that learning French in a practical way,
                    living in a different culture, traveling and seeing the sights was what whetted
                    my appetite for first the Peace Corps and then the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at the Woodrow Wilson School? Was one pointed
                        toward public service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Absolutely. Woodrow Wilson, as president of Princeton, had encouraged the
                    motto of the school: “Princeton in the nation's service.” The Woodrow Wilson
                    School became the embodiment of that value, and to this day has a charter for
                    preparing people for public service, the core of which is government
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at that time inquiring and looking into any
                        particular area of government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HULL: We were very anti-government. In my circle, we couldn't imagine working for
                    the U.S. government. In terms of substantive matters, actually I was looking at
                    Africa. Not for any very good reason. and in fact at one stage I played with the
                    idea of going to Africa, taking my junior year going abroad to an African
                    university, and I went and talked to a very, very eminent professor at the
                    Woodrow Wilson School from Africa, proposed this and only to have him look at me
                    disbelievingly, saying, “Why would you leave one of the foremost educational
                    institutions in the world and spend a year at a much less formidable educational
                    institution”. That common sense prevailed and so I gave up that idea. I was
                    looking at Africa I think probably because civil rights were big and we were
                    looking for bridges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Civil rights, during the time from high school did civil
                        rights run across your radar much or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think the civil rights part of it really came home when Doctor King was
                    killed and when the cities in the U.S. exploded and again watching Baltimore
                    burn was very vivid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any of the civil rights or
                        anti-Viet Nam marches at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was involved in some of the anti-Viet Nam stuff. The march on Washington,
                    for example. We were all down here and got tear gassed in some kind of big
                    demonstration. But I didn't do it seriously, I never joined the Students for a
                    Democratic Society, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a pretty radical group, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, of course, it started out being Jeffersonian with the Port Huron
                    statement, and then gradually moved to a much more militant style.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Oddly enough, I did my senior thesis in sociology looking at young people
                    in Tunisia. I had an adviser who had gotten data from Tunisia, and we were
                    looking at what motivated peoplwhat the achievement motivations were among those
                    young people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Very much so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Not really. The conclusion was I managed to finish the paper, which was
                    pretty dicey. I kind of collapsed as I crossed the finish line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were girls or women at Princeton at this stage or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: When I entered Princeton we had about twenty “critters” which were critical
                    language girls, and the first women who were admitted I think. During my senior
                    year, the first regular female students were admitted to Princeton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now the majority are women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, we have a woman President and the Dean of the Wilson School is a
                    woman. I think women are slightly less than half the students at Princeton. They
                    certainly are there in force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were graduated in 1971, was the draft still

                </p>
                <p>HULL: The draft was still on so you had questions about where you fell in the
                    lottery, and for many of my colleagues there were existential questions. Were
                    they going to go to Canada? Were they going to go to jail? In the end, my choice
                    was the Peace Corps. I managed to do my service in the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you to the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The summer in France had been a very positive experience. I liked mastering
                    a foreign situation and foreign language. I was ready for more of that. I
                    thought the Peace Corps was a good way of getting into a French-speaking
                    environment.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HULL: I was accepted and I was sent to Tunisia. Oddly enough, when I was senior
                    at Princeton I had a roommate who was studying Arabic, and I thought that was
                    the oddest choice of any language I could imagine. And then I found myself in
                    the Peace Corps in Tunisia and, after brushing up my French, I started studying
                    Arabic. That was the second step that really determined my career, I think,
                    gaining a capability in Arabic via the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was at a lyc�e in Mahdia teaching English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's the town or city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Mahdia is a city of historical importance. It is located on the coast about
                    midway down the coast of Tunisia, between Sousse and Sfax. Mahdia was the
                    capital of the Fatimides. The Fatimides were a Shia sect that came to power in
                    Tunisia and then moved east and conquered a good deal of the Islamic world and
                    actually founded the city of Cairo and established a Shia Caliphate in Cairo
                    that endured for, I believe, centuries. So they started in Mahdia and moved to
                    Cairo as did I in stages of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation there? I assume you were
                        in Tunisia from 1971 to 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. And what they told us as we entered the Peace Corps was the one
                    thing we could count on was that there would be a change of leadership during
                    our time in Tunisia because President Bourguiba was very old. It didn't happen,
                    of course, and then when I went back to Tunisia as the political counselor in
                    198that would've been fourteen years latethat change of power still had yet to
                    occur and actually did occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Peace Corps training like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was excellent training. They took us to Colorado, they took us to
                    Colchester, England and then they took us to Mahdia. They taught us French, they
                    taught us Arabic, they taught us about Tunisian culture and Islamic culture and
                    the fasts and the feasts and the tenets of Islam. It was a very good
                    introduction to North Africa.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the high school system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was French. It was just transplanted from France. It was called a lyc�e
                    and it acted like a lyc�e. We graded on a twenty point scale, most of the
                    teachers were Tunisian, but there were French “co-operants” (volunteers) there
                    and the Peace Corps volunteers there. We made $160.00 a month and we lived very
                    well on $160.00 a month. Our problem was that we were entering a strange
                    educational culture, an educational culture not quite Truffaut's “Five Hundred
                    Blows” but pretty strict and pretty compulsory. The big mistake that American
                    teachers made was they became too close to their students, and therefore
                    forfeited respect, and they graded too liberally giving 16s and 17s out of 20,
                    sometimes even 20 out of 20, when every French teacher knew that you graded
                    around 10,11 or 12 so that you always had the option of failing a student.
                    That's the way you kept them in line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you fall into that trap?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I kept the distance from the students and the respect, but I was a more
                    liberal grader than my French counterparts. Besides the numerical grades, we
                    were meant to record “appreciations” (comments) and there I kind of ran afoul
                    because of my inadequate French. Most of the “appreciations” were things like
                    “tres bon” (very good) or “peut mieux faire” (can do better), and I got bored
                    with writing these on my students' report cards so I started cribbing from my
                    fellow teachers. There was one that particularly appealed to me which was “il
                    essaie, mais ces moyens sont limites” (he's trying, but he has limited
                    capabilities). I wrote that for one of my students that I really liked and
                    admired for his efforts. Then I got an unexpected visit from his father wanting
                    to know why I was dismissing his son as dull and unable. I had to explain it was
                    not his son, but my French that was inadequate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was still I think a good time for Bourguiba. He was progressive in a
                    number of areas, and Tunisia was developing. I think Tunisia was a relatively
                    good place to live in North Africa. Certainly for women, perhaps the best place
                    in the Islamic world to be living.</p>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HULL: Qadhafi took over in the early seventies, but he was still in his
                    enlightened phase. He wasn't yet identified as the menace that he became later.
                    But when I returned to Tunisia in 1987 both Libya and Algeria were very, very
                    problematic vis-�-vis Tunisia. But in the 70s, at least as far as I was aware,
                    there wasn't a lot of regional tension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Algeria, this was after the Evian Accords and all that,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. Algeria was progressing. I hitchhiked through Algeria to Morocco and
                    came back by train. I hitchhiked in Libya. I slept in the ruins of Subratha; it
                    was before the anti-Americanism and the violence. It was still relatively normal
                    in both countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel that Algeria, in particular after
                        this civil war, or whatever you want to call it, Algerians got out, both
                        Algeria and Tunisia got out from under French rule. The Tunisians had kept
                        their French ties, and it didn't seem to disrupt the country the way Algeria
                        sort of went down hill certainly economically. Did you see that
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At the time I wasn't aware of it. It depended upon how the French related
                    to the country. France incorporated Algeria as a province of France. They wanted
                    Algeria to be as French as Paris. In Tunisia they never had that ambition, and
                    therefore the rule in Tunisia was always lighter. Also the Tunisians were able
                    to gain their independence primarily through political moves. So the two
                    situations were very different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The students were challenging. They did challenge, and they would take the
                    measure of the teachers and if they could get them on the run, they would do it.
                    Not all of the students, but there would be classes, especially what they called
                    the technical classes. These were the more vocational-minded students who
                    probably questioned the relevance of learning English to their futures given the
                    fact that they were Arabic speakers and had already learned French. It was a big
                    challenge, and it took a certain amount of courage to go in, especially to a
                    technical class and maintain control and get them to learn something. So I
                    generally, especially with the technical classes, went in with a very heavy hand
                    in the first couple of weeks coming down pretty hard and then after establishing
                    who was boss could afford to relax a little bit. I actually had some good
                    results with those students after gaining their respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the classes mixed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, they were mixed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a special school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, it was a standard Tunisian lyc�e, but Bourguiba had no problems with
                    mixing the sexes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Islam present a problem or a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Islam in Tunisia is a very natural phenomenon. The Tunisians are very
                    comfortable with Islam, and they practice it, but not fanatically. We were able
                    to participate in the feasts and we were able to go to such places Kairouan,
                    which is an historic Islamic city, and visit the Grand Mosque there. We would be
                    there on Islamic feasts, and no one raised an eyebrow and it caused no tension.
                    There was an openness that I think is much rarer today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself up against the Israeli factor of
                        America there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I knew very, very little about the Middle East at this point. I remember
                    one evening in Mahdia with some teaching colleagues running into an extremely
                    articulate Arab who spoke English very, very well and who was politically
                    extremely sophisticated and then to learn that this was a Palestinian. I think
                    this was the first glimmer I had that there was an issue out there, and a people
                    out there who had a very special view of the Middle East. Little did I know at
                    the time that I would eventually marry a Palestinian from Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy cross your path at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We tried to stay far from the embassy. I was still recovering from my
                    university days. I didn't want to be associated with the embassy, and I didn't
                    think I needed the embassy for very much. But we did give into cheese burgers at
                    the snack bar when we were up in Tunis, and at one time I had to go to the
                    health unit to try to get condoms which I failed to do. In fact, I was kicked
                    out of the health unit for even asking for that service which meant I had to go
                    to the local pharmacy. Since I didn't know the word for contraceptive in French,
                    I had to explain in imperfect French and with gestures what I wanted. Then I was
                    kicked out of the pharmacy as well. So my initial contact with the embassy
                    wasn't very productive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask, were you able to get this vital piece of
                        equipment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HULL: I think I finally consulted a Larousse and got the right French word, which
                    is “preservative”, and that did the trick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were teaching there, did you run across the
                        French establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Very much so. The “cooperants” were of course a phenomenon unto themselves.
                    They were teaching not only in Tunisia but all over the former French
                    empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were a little like a French Peace Corps weren't they?
                        They were part of the military system. Weren't they young people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They weren't necessarily young. They were teaching professionals. It was
                    more like USAID. They got a salary from France, and then they got a salary from
                    Tunisia. Together that made their work quite remunerative. The French in Mahdia,
                    included a lot of sailors especially people from Brittany, and several of them
                    brought their boats down to Mahdia, which had a beautiful fishing port. They
                    actually started a sailing club there, and I joined and learned to sail in
                    French which caused some problems when I got back on the Chesapeake. It was a
                    wonderful pastime and gave me a lot of contact with the French “cooperants” whom
                    I liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't any tension between the American Peace Corps
                        and the French “cooperants”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No. In fact they taught me sailing, and I taught them English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it than that you weren't aware of some of the winds
                        that were blowing through the Middle East which got worse and worse and
                        worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Only vaguely. I was aware of the 1967 war, but that was back when I was
                    working as a journalist in Springfield. No, in Tunisia we were somewhat removed
                    from the real crises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in the summer of 1973 so you missed the October
                        War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was planning to do a third year in Morocco, and I was studying in
                    Morocco, but I had taken the Foreign Service exam at our embassy in Tunis, and I
                    had passed. I came back to Washington and took the oral, and then was notified
                    that I was accepted. So I was in transition between the Peace Corps and the
                    Foreign Service, but actually in Morocco in October, and I remember the October
                    War from that context.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About the October War, how was this received in
                        Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think the initial Egyptian victories in crossing the canal caused a great
                    elation, and so it was overall a very positive feeling at the time. I remember
                    tracking what the Israelis were doing in response, and Sharon's move across the
                    canal and the encirclement of the Third Army. I remember being thoughtful enough
                    to hope that somehow the situation could be frozen so the gains made could
                    provide a basis for future negotiations. In fact, that's what happened with
                    Kissinger and the shuttles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused you to apply to the Foreign Service? Not only
                        were you anti-government they wouldn't even give you a condom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, I think I was really developing options for after the Peace Corps. I
                    had a third year in Morocco lined up but what after that? I had two main
                    options: the first was doing what I was doing but in a diplomatic way. I decided
                    to see if that was a real option. And the second one was journalism. I actually
                    interviewed with the Associated Press in New York and might well have gone into
                    foreign journalism except for the fact they wanted me to do two or three years
                    of apprenticeship on a local American newspaper and I thought I'd done that
                    already in Springfield and could get where I wanted to be overseas faster
                    through the Foreign Service than through the Associated Press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took the Foreign Service exam in what, in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Either early '73 or '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you came back and took the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I do. What I recall about the oral exam was, I had done a lot of reading in
                    the Peace Corps, including Edmund Wilson on communism, and I recall being able
                    to answer several of the questions based on my Peace Corps reading rather than
                    anything I had learned at Princeton. I also recall a question on Kissinger in
                    Chile which I didn't know a lot about but I answered, I guess, acceptably.
                    Probably I was lucky that I didn't know more than I knew because then maybe my
                    answer would not have been so acceptable.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. There is something I tell my students at Princeton who are going into
                    the exam process, particularly the oral. To me there was a great benefit knowing
                    I had an interview with the Associated Press afterwards in New York City,
                    because I could go into the oral examination with it being one option of at
                    least two. Therefore I didn't really feel it was a make-or-break encounter and
                    was able to be fairly relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I told the Peace Corps that I had this offer from the Foreign Service. They
                    didn't want me to start in Morocco and then pull out midyear so I came back late
                    in 1973, and I had to find some way of bridging the period until I got my
                    clearances and could be inducted. It turned out that was about five months
                    because I didn't get in until May of 1974. So I went up to Chicago and drove a
                    taxicab and lived with my brother, and then I came out to Washington and taught
                    English on Dupont Circle and made ends meet that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was a private language school on Dupont Circle with Hispanics, Persians,
                    Araba United Nations of students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was driving a taxicab in Chicago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was an experience. Chicago has a grid pattern so it's a very logical
                    place to drive. With a good map and some clever reasoning you could actually
                    find your way around. But there were certain anomalies; Lake Shore Drive, for
                    example, had only a few places in and out. I still recall picking up a customer
                    who wanted to go to the McCormick Center and driving down Lakeshore Drive
                    missing the left exit and whizzing by the center, which he remarked, having to
                    turn around and come back northward and there are no exits at McCormick Center
                    northward, so I had to whiz by it a second time and only on the third go were we
                    able to get to the exit and get the man delivered. He was not too happy with
                    this as you can imagine. My excuse was that I was a novice cab driver, I don't
                    think he found convincing. I have a lot of stories here.</p>

                <p>HULL: One of my most memorable rides was a Playboy bunny whom I picked up outside
                    the Playboy Club. She had just been suspended for fraternizing with a client As
                    I was taking her home she was explaining to me her troubles, and I was very
                    sympathetic, as you can imagine. When we got to her destination she went to pay
                    me and she apologized for not having enough to give the tip. But she did have an
                    ice cream cone which she offered instead of the tip. The phantasy sufficed, and
                    I declined the ice cream. There are lots of stories about Chicago.</p>

                    sorting out what this is all about and who are these other people. We had great
                    people in that class, Mike Metrinko, Don Camp, Molly Williamson, and Chuck
                    Redmond. We were getting paid. I had been living on a shoestring and all of a
                    sudden I was getting paid, so I could live relatively high in Washington. I do
                    remember that after the A-100 course we got our assignments. I set a record. My
                    initial assignment was for five yeartwo years of Arabic language training and
                    then three years as political officer in Jerusalem. I think that reflected the
                    desperation of the Foreign Service for Arabic speakers at the time. After the
                    Kissinger shuttles, we had opened up embassies throughout the Gulf and reopened
                    embassies in places like Cairo and so there was this huge demand for Arabic
                    speakers. I spoke decent Arabic coming out of the Peace Corps and was slotted
                    into that Arabic program and then slated for Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>The other interesting thing was that I had time to kill before the Arabic program
                    started that September so I took a consular course and about a week into the
                    consular course the Turks invaded northern Cyprus.</p>
                <p>A: July 14, 1974.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. They needed volunteers to go work on the task force so I and a number
                    of others volunteered. We went over and worked the graveyard shift and got our
                    first real exposure to crisis management. I have vivid memories at that time; we
                    were evacuating people from Nicosia through the British sovereign bases to
                    Beirut and taking them into Lebanon which was a relatively stable place and then
                    out of Lebanon to the U.S. In light of the Lebanese Civil War soon to follow, I
                    now find this activity ironic. So I had that experience in the summer of 1974,
                    and then really kicked into the Arabic training at FSI Arlington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you mentally prepared yourself to do this? Were you
                        ready to relax and go wherever you were sent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I had very much wanted to pursue the Arabic study and to serve in the
                    Arabic-speaking world. So this was right up my alley. I took to it like a duck
                    to water.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been off in the Maghreb, quite removed really from
                        the cockpit of the Middle East. Were you reading your way in or were you
                        getting yourself informed about what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. I was getting smarter and actually the Arabic training was a part of
                    that process. My initial class in Arlington had two other students in it. Our
                    teacher was an Egyptian woman. When I opened my mouth and spoke my Tunisian
                    Arabic she was appalled. It was the most offensive Arabic she had ever heard in
                    her life. One of my classmates had grown up in Cairo and spoke the Egyptian
                    dialect. For the first time in my life, I confronted real prejudice. I had to
                    gradually shed my Tunisian accent and adopt a more Egyptian variant. After that
                    experience, we went over to Lebanon to the language school at the embassy in
                    Beirut and there most of the teachers were Palestinians. And so along with the
                    language you imbibed history and politics from the teachers. I got smarter
                    fast.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Godley. Mac Godley. Godley was a very colorful person. He had been, I
                    believe, in Laos and had been very much involved in the counter-insurgency
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was called the bombing officer or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. And I still remember my introduction. When we got to Beirut, it was
                    just on the eve of the civil war and when we walked around West Beirut, young
                    men with Kalashnikovs were positioned on the street corners. It was an armed
                    camp even around the embassy, which was a rather sobering sight. The embassy
                    itself had an APC parked in front of it because it had been attacked. We were
                    given our introduction by Ambassador Godley who proceeded to explain why Lebanon
                    despite its many troubles would never sink into civil strife because there were
                    cross-cutting connections among the economic elites that would prevent that. Of
                    course, it was an ill-fated prediction because even though we were only there
                    six months we were there to see that civil strife ignited. But I was young, I
                    was eligible, and I was invited by the ambassador to a luncheon because there
                    was a young single guest, a female, who needed companionship. I spoke a little
                    bit of French and a little bit of Arabic and was a good choice for that. I
                    remember going to the luncheon, which was hosted by a prominent Lebanese
                    Christian family. After the luncheon the young lady and I were taken out by the
                    young Lebanese to do two things: one, to take target practice with an AK-47 on a
                    mountainside and two, they brought out a stallion and mated him with a mare.
                    This was the recreation, the entertainment for the afternoon luncheon.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>The reason I mention this is because the prominent Christian family was the only
                    real contact I had with a political family in Lebanon. After I had been in
                    Beirut for a while, I was asked about that connection. The way that happened was
                    I had bought a car, a red Fiat 128, and I think it was the first or second
                    weekend that I owned the car and was driving around Beirut. I was going down
                    from my apartment in the Manara (lighthouse) District to a movie theater and
                    noticed first that the theater was closed and then the streets were empty. I
                    concluded something was amiss, so I started heading back to my apartment, but
                    missed the turn on Hamrah Street, which was the main street of West Beirut. I
                    went up one street further and found myself confronting a Palestinian roadblock.
                    My car had diplomatic plates. I was stopped, the car was searched.
                    Unfortunately, the weekend before we had gone to Deir al Qamar (the Monastery of
                    the Moon) one of the tourist attractions in Lebanon, and one of my colleagues
                    had left a camera under the back seat of the car. So when the car was searched
                    at the roadblock, the camera was discovered, and it was associated with the
                    diplomatic license plate. I was immediately taken by the armed militants into
                    the Palestinian camp, which I believe was Tel Az Za'atar (Hill of Thyme). I
                    glimpsed a poster on a wall which showed an arrow bent through Jordan and into
                    Palestine so I believe my captors where from the Popular Front for the
                    Liberation of Palestine whose ideology called for liberating Palestine via the
                    overthrow of Jordan's Hashemite monarchy. I was interrogated, hooded, for quite
                    awhile as they tried to figure out whether or not I was spying. It was a very
                    vivid experience, the interrogation. I remember being guarded, I could just
                    barely see through the hood, and I can remember being guarded by someone who
                    looked like he was about twelve years old with a finger on the trigger of the
                    Kalashnikov pointed right at me. There was rocketing going on that you could
                    hear from the detention area. I remember in the middle of the night being woken
                    up, taken in my car, my head forced down in the back seat. The individual who
                    was guarding me in the back's heart was beating violently. I could only think
                    the one reason why that would be happening, and that was he was ordered to do
                    away with me and was a little bit nervous about doing the job. I really thought
                    that was the end. But in fact, what happened was they took me to a second camp,
                    repeated all the interrogation, and I was lucky because I knew nothing about
                    embassy operations other than the language school. I had no secrets to hide. The
                    only thing I had to hide was this weekend association with this prominent
                    Christian family. My technique in answering the questions was to tell the
                    absolute truth about everything but one fact and to lie about that fact
                    consistently. By strictly limiting the amount of lying that I was doing, it made
                    it easier to keep track because, of course, in interrogation that's the
                    technique to try to catch you contradicting yourself. After many, many, many
                    hours and a few relatively minor knocks on the head, one of my interrogators
                    came in, un-hooded me, displayed my personal effects including the camera. I had
                    been telling them take the film and develop it because then they would see the
                    only thing that's on the film is a tourist site, nothing in the security way.
                    And they returned all the personal effects, including the camera. I had assumed
                    that they had checked out the film in some way. They asked me whether I had been
                    mistreated. I said no. And then they told me they were going to release me and
                    they actually took me out to a main street, Sharia' al Mazra' (the Street of the
                    Farm) and gave me precise instructions to get to the Corniche that ran along
                    Beirut's coastline and to the American Embassy. They didn't want me to turn off
                    into another camp and end up in more trouble. I followed the instructions very,
                    very carefully, drove back to the embassy and then reported my captivity. This
                    was before, just before, all the American hostages were taken and held in Beirut
                    for years and years and years. I think my timing on being a hostage was
                    fortunate indeed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the embassy's reaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Surprise. They hadn't missed me. Of course, I was debriefed extensively. I
                    think it was upon debriefing that I concluded that I had been held by the PLFP
                    (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine) given the poster I had seen on
                    the wall. That was my most vivid experience in Beirut.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the language class? All of a sudden
                        you're moving into this situation. Did they keep it going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, it was touch and go for weeks and months. Finally, they decided they
                    had to move the school. And the proposal was to move it to Tunisia. I had pretty
                    much finished the course by then, but I still had about six months before I had
                    to report for duty in Jerusalem in January, 1975 so I proposed to them that they
                    let me take off on my own to the University of Jordan and enroll myself at the
                    University of Jordan. They agreed. I packed up all my belongings into my red
                    Fiat and took out when there was a pause in the fighting, over the mountains and
                    into Damascus and from there, of course, it was easy getting down to Amman,
                    Jordan. I'm not sure that the regional security officer these days would allow a
                    junior officer to do something like that but back then it was possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left there, was the embassy still talking
                        like it's not going to turn into civil war? Were they downplaying what was
                        happening or were they taking it pretty seriously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, that all changed after the “Ain Rumanah” incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Ain Rumanah (the spring of Rumanah) was a neighborhood of Beirut. There was
                    a busload of Palestinians going through it. Christian militias massacred them.
                    To my mind anyway, that marked the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. It was
                    downhill pretty quickly thereafter. As I said, you went one block above Hamrah,
                    the main street in Beirut, and you ran into Palestinian guerrillas controlling
                    the whole show. No, I think by that time the embassy knew it was serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Palestinian teachers mainly. In the first place
                        this whole thing was basically a spillover from Black September of 1970,
                        wasn't it? The Palestinian militants had been kicked out of Jordan and ended
                        up in Beirut, weren't they? Was that the genesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: That was a significant factor. The armed Palestinian presence and moreover
                    the Palestinian operations from southern Lebanon into Israel and the Israeli
                    retaliations for those operations which were pushing more and more poor Shia
                    from the south of Lebanon up into the capital and creating the southern suburbs
                    which became the bases of Hezbollah. But that was only one factor. The Lebanese
                    political system had been frozen for decades, along confessional lines. There
                    were families, the Jumblatts, the Gemayels, etc. which had basically turned
                    Lebanon into private fiefdoms and controlled a lot of the government wealth that
                    was channeled into private pockets. There was a big gap and a growing gap
                    between the way the well-to-do lived in Lebanon on a European level of
                    prosperity and the poor, particularly the poor Shia, who had been forced into
                    the southern suburbs of Beirut. And that economic tension was just
                    extraordinary. The mismatch between how politics were run in Lebanon and the
                    demographic facts caused very great tensions. So when it came, it was more
                    sectariaChristians, Musliand the Palestinians initially tried to stay out of it,
                    but then got sucked into it eventually. So it was a very complicated picture,
                    but definitely not as rosy as Ambassador Godley had painted it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went for what, six months or so to the University of
                        Amman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Six months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1973 or 1974 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was 1974 to 1975. Tom Pickering was the ambassador at the time, a
                    remarkable man. I remember my interview with him when I was leaving Jordan and
                    remember: one that he wanted to see me because I wasn't a very prominent person,
                    but two, that within the space of about twenty minutes had he had absorbed from
                    me almost the entirety of my intensive experience at the University. He had put
                    it into his data bank and had it ready. It was an interesting experience in many
                    ways because, of course, the campus was very politicized with lots of
                    Palestinian teachers and lots of Palestinian students. Having an American
                    diplomat there, as you can imagine, presented certain opportunities for
                    provocations, but by and large I enjoyed the experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you're looking at one perspective, but how did
                        you see the situation in Jordan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HULL: Of course, this was in the aftermath of Black September, which occurred in
                    1970. It was Jordan returning to normalcy, I think. Having come from Beirut
                    where the Civil War was just breaking out, by comparison Jordan seemed calm and
                    relatively effectively governed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among the students you say there were a significant number
                        of Palestinians. How did they view the king?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I don't know if I remember anything that was specifically said. I think,
                    maybe this was imagining more than anything else, there was lingering resentment
                    but at the same time respect because he had confronted a very challenging
                    situation and he had mastered it. So no love lost, I think, but perhaps some
                    grudging respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think given that you have the Palestinian
                        population and you had the Jordanian population of more of nomadic stock, I
                        would have thought the Palestinians would almost overwhelm the university by
                        their presence. Palestinians are like Jews. They go for education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. I think that's true. Very many of the professors were Palestinians.
                    The course I took on Palestinian issue was done by a Palestinian professor. My
                    Arabic teacher at the university was a Palestinian from a prominent Jerusalem
                    family. Yes, they were the dominant intellectual force.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: People were looking at what they would call Palestine and of course you had
                    the phenomenon there where Israelis watched Jordanian TV and Jordanians watched
                    Israeli TV depending upon the programs being offered. It wasn't the other side
                    of the moon. There was a knowledge and not quite familiarity, but certainly a
                    pretty good knowledge of what the other side was like.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HULL: I didn't have any political incidents that were unmanageable, a couple of
                    perhaps embarrassments. I remember there was huge class on the Palestinian
                    problem, maybe 150 students. One day we came in and the Israelis had just
                    attacked Palestinians in southern Lebanon, and the professor invited me to come
                    up and justify the Israeli conduct and I really didn't think that was my
                    responsibility: as a student to be justifying anything much less as a
                    non-Israeli to be justifying what Israel was doing, so I declined that
                    invitation. Other professors would invite me. I remember I took a diplomatic
                    course, and the professors would invite me to talk a little bit about how an
                    issue would be handled as a practical matter.</p>
                <p>Ironically, my most difficult course was my Arabic course. It was classical
                    Arabic and I'd only studied colloquial and modern standard Arabic. This was very
                    challenging material. It included “Kalila wa Dimna” a kind of Aesop's Fables in
                    Arabic, and I found the vocabulary very strange, nothing to do with diplomacy or
                    economics or politics. It had to do with jackals and foxes and chickens and
                    things like this. I took the final exam in that course and the professor called
                    me in. She had kind of a depressed look on her face and she said, “Well, I think
                    one thing is sure, and that is you have no future in the Arabic world given what
                    you have done on this exam.” And she was right, I had no future in terms of
                    classical Arabic literature at all in the Middle East, but I did find
                    applications for my colloquial and Modern Standard Arabic.</p>

                    to the Allenby Bridge and had everything including the plants carried across
                    into the West Bank and then up to Jerusalem.</p>

                <p>HULL: I was the sole political officer in the consulate from 1975 through 1979.
                    Mike Newlin was consul general, and Don Kruse was his deputy.</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HULL: Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and West Jerusalem is very, very
                    Israeli. East Jerusalem was under the Hashemites before 1967 and was primarily
                    Arab Palestinian. So what you had in Jerusalem was really a schizophrenic
                    situation where on a daily basis you would be dealing with Israelis and
                    Palestinians who had radically different views of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had King Hussein renounced his rule over the West Bank at
                        this point? Or was that later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At Rabat in 1974 at the Arab Summit, the Arab leaders agreed that the PLO
                    (Palestinian Liberation Organization) was the sole, legitimate spokesman for the
                    Palestinian people. King Hussein had to accept that decision. So formally the
                    torch had passed, but informally, I think, the King maintained residual
                    ambitions, not in a sense of wanting to impose himself but wanting to be
                    available if others asked him to play a role. And certainly with regards to the
                    Haram Sharif, the Islamic holy places, the Hashemite had had a long, profound
                    association there and continued to pay the salaries of the Haram officials. I
                    think he had a lingering ambition, but one which was rarely articulated. The
                    Israelis for their part, also very much wanted to keep King Hussein and the
                    Hashemites in the picture because one of their preferred option was some kind of
                    a role for Jordan in the West Bank in a final solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the balance that you all had to deal with? The
                        Israelis were occupying significant parts of the West Bank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were occupying the entire West Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the same time we did not recognize the legitimacy of
                        this or how was this dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We considered it an occupied territory. We didn't recognize Israel's claims
                    to it nor did we recognize, for example, the expansion of the Jerusalem city
                    limit or the annexation of the Golan. We thought all of the territories should
                    be subject to a negotiation in an agreed settlement. The consulate in Jerusalem
                    was unique in the world. It was the only consulate that was independent of any
                    embassies. The consulate reported directly back to the State Department, not
                    through Embassy Tel Aviv. The Consul General had a very delicate position in
                    this regard. Our mandate was to be the liaison and to report vis-�-vis, the
                    Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, not GazGaza was under the
                    embassand secondly, to be the liaison and report on the municipal Israeli
                    government, Mayor Teddy Kollek at the time. That was what we were meant to do.
                    In doing it, of course, we were very much interacting with Embassy TelAviv and
                    their responsibilities. It caused a certain amount of friction, a certain amount
                    of tension and was a challenge.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the relationship? The ambassador
                        was Sam Lewis, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The ambassador was Sam Lewis.</p>

                        how did they deal with each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Of course, Sam Lewis was a force of nature, he was ambassador for a very,
                    very long time, had an excellent reputation in Washington, an extrovert, very
                    confident. Mike Newlin was quiet, but also extremely competent and very good at
                    getting things done in a low-key way. And Mike Newlin, I think, successfully
                    defended the independence of the consulate and did very delicate reporting with
                    a great deal of integrity. You could admire both of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Israelis are not noted for shyness. And I would
                        imagine there would be constant attempts to, I don't want to say compromise,
                        that's the wrong term but to do something which would give the Israelis more
                        control than they might have if we didn't do something? Did you find
                        yourself maneuvered or pushed or concerned about something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, of course. The Israelis were always pushing and one of their major
                    objectives was to get the embassy moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and really
                    displace the consulate. We were under constant pressure and receiving constant
                    attention from the Israelis. We were operating in a fishbowl. With me it came to
                    a head. I was responsible for reporting on settlement activity. This was a
                    period of significant expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East
                    Jerusalem. There was a great readership for this material. We didn't realize
                    initially how much of a readership until we started getting feedback, and it
                    turned out that President Carter was tracking the issue very closely and would
                    be commenting upon reports we had submitted about settlement expansion. So we
                    felt we had a pretty important mission in that regard. Of course, the Israeli
                    actions were quite at odds what they were saying or giving us to believe and
                    therefore reporting the facts on the ground was reporting something that was
                    embarrassing to Tel Aviv. I would go out on these periodic field trips and
                    record changes. On one field trip, after telling my immediate boss that I was
                    going out, I was in the proximity of one of the settlements and encountered
                    Israeli security people who detained me. I explained who I was, who I was
                    working for, and what I was doing. They detained me, they made some calls, and
                    then eventually after 45 minutes or so I was released. Only fair, I had been
                    detained by the Palestinians in Beirut and now I was detained by the
                    Israelis.</p>
                <p>I got back to Jerusalem and reported up my chain of command to my bosses about
                    the incident which was a very good thing to do because quickly Ambassador Lewis
                    was notified by the Israeli government that I had been engaged in inappropriate
                    activity. Lewis called my boss to find out what it was all about, and
                    fortunately Mike Newlin was able to brief Ambassador Lewis that this was in the
                    line of duty, reporting on a subject of great interest to Washington. So
                    Ambassador Lewis to his credit pushed back and, I believe, defended my activity.
                    That didn't stop the Israelis. The issue was leaked, it was on the radio and the
                    following days an editorial appeared in Haaretz, one of the leading newspapers
                    entitled “Shalom, Mr. Hull”, which was “Goodbye, Mr. Hull.” Haaretz was hoping
                    that I would be given my walking papers, but in fact the Consulate, the Embassy,
                    the Department stood in back of me, and I continued my reporting and finished
                    out my tour quite normally.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: With the settlers themselves. Yes, although we didn't take a
                    confrontational, we tried to avoid a confrontational approach, whereby we would
                    be challenging personally what they were doing with their lives, but inevitably
                    you would be running into thesePeople, and they wouldn't be shy at all about
                    telling their story and why they believed they have a claim on one spot or

                        was this a pretty good deal? Low rent or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: There were several factors. There were Labor settlements along the Jordan
                    valley and there it was a security objective that the Labor government had
                    promoted. But then you had a very strong religious element and the settlements,
                    for example, in (???) on the way to Hebron, there you had true believers who
                    were really fulfilling what they considered to be a Biblical imperative. Also
                    though there's no doubt the Israelis provided considerable material advantages
                    to people who were willing to go and settle. You could get a much nicer villa in
                    a settlement than you could ever afford in Israel proper, and you had a number
                    of financial incentives if you were willing to live in the occupied
                    territories.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a significant number of the Israeli settlers who

                <p>HULL: Yes. Sometimes the most fanatic were Americans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: They would come to the consulate for consular services. Consular affairs
                    were done in East Jerusalem across the Green Line which had been erased
                    physically after the 1967 war but nevertheless, on the Arab side, which was
                    always somewhat of a problem for Israelis because they didn't feel all together
                    comfortable. Other business was done in West Jerusalem. The political section
                    where I worked, the economic section, the commercial section, all of these were
                    in the West Jerusalem, and the Arabs if they wanted to avail themselves of those
                    services had to come across and use those facilities. Mostly what we did with
                    the Israeli public was consular services which were very important because they
                    had many connections with the U.S. and then again as I said, we did deal with
                    the municipal government and that we did out of the office in West
                    Jerusalem.</p>

                <p>HULL: He was imaginative, he was active, he, I believe, really wanted to unite
                    the city and not just physically, but also on a human level. I think he had a
                    measure of sympathy for the Arab population that was unusual. He was a showman
                    of the first degree, and I really think his public diplomacy was extraordinary
                    in stamping Israel's “trademark” over most things in Jerusalem. Not all together
                    an easy thing to do when you think of the television shot of Jerusalem with the
                    Haram Sharif's Kubbah As Sakhra (the Noble Sanctuary's Dome of the Rock) in the
                    background. Ironically, the classic visual of Jerusalem testifies to an Islamic
                    character. But Teddy Kollek was quite able and quite effective. He had working
                    with him Meron Benveniste, who knew the Palestinians very well, and who had
                    written on the Palestinians and the Crusaders. It was a relatively enlightened
                    municipal government.</p>

                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, but we found this restriction easy to finesse. Technically any member
                    of the PLO in the occupied territories was a member of an illegal organization
                    and therefore should be in jail. We concluded that anyone who was not in jail
                    was prima facie not a member of the PLO and therefore fair game for us, and we
                    did talk with anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk a little bit about being a political
                        officer? How did you go about your business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I came on board in January, and I believe it was February or March when
                    they had the first municipal elections since the occupation had begun in 1967.
                    These elections were of great interest because there would be a relatively free
                    vote and the true sympathies of the West Bank electorate would be gauged for the
                    first time since Israel had occupied the territories and so the priority was
                    covering that election. I know my bosses had some trepidation because they had a
                    new political officer, green and unproven, and the elections would be his first
                    challenge. It was a very interesting election. Often it was decided by “tazkiat”
                    (consensus). In fact in all municipalities it was decided by consensus. In
                    Bethlehem, the old familieparticularly the Freij'held sway. In most of the
                    municipalities, however, the consensus process came up with a nationalist slate
                    of young, intelligent, active Palestinians who were not formally associated with
                    the PLO, but who made clear their affinity to the PLO and considered the PLO as
                    the spokesman of the Palestinian people. So we dealt with people like Fuad
                    Qasimi, Karim Khalaf, Bassam Shaka'a, Mohamed Milhereally a new generation of
                    Palestinian leaders, who were impressive for what they wanted to do in their
                    cities and for their ability to articulate the Palestinian position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this particular time, was there a concern that the
                        Israeli security services were trying to undermine, discredit any potential
                        Palestinian leader that was coming down the path?</hi>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HULL: No. The Israelis, I think, welcomed a homegrown Palestinian leadership and
                    their hope was that this leadership would somehow develop and supplant the
                    leadership that was then outside of Palestine in Lebanon. The Israelis gave
                    these Palestinians leeway.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a figure was Arafat at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Arafat was the embodiment of the Palestinian national cause. He was really
                    without a rival, and Palestinians in the West Bank supported him sincerely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Oh, sure. This was the Carter period. There was a big emphasis on human
                    rights, and the human rights report coming in from the Consulate General in
                    Jerusalem was one of the most problematic reports to hit the desk in the
                    Department, which is still the case today.</p>

                <p>HULL: They had to do their own report, and yes, I am sure they found a lot of
                    what we were reporting created problems for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a junior officer yourself. There's always the
                        thing in any embassy or consulate where junior officers seek out sensation
                        and are looking for extreme cases and all. The most senior officers tend to
                        modify them. I mean this is the dynamic that goes on all the time. Did you
                        find this going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HULL: No. There was a very interesting case which was not actually related to the
                    human rights report. We had assigned to the consulate a woman who had been an
                    INR (Intelligence and Research) analyst and wanted to do political reporting,
                    but she was doing consular work. She was giving immigrant visas, I think. In the
                    course of her visa interviews she had a significant number of Palestinians who
                    had been prisoners of the Israelis. In the course of interviewing, she developed
                    a significant number of accounts of mistreatment of prisoners, and being a
                    trained INR analyst she, of course, was able in a sophisticated way to compare
                    the accounts and come up with certain patterns, accounts from independent
                    sources of significant mistreatment or torture of the Palestinian detainees. She
                    collected all of this and she wrote it up in a very, very coherent fashion and
                    she submitted it to Mike Newlin and Don Kruse, and it was sent in. The cable
                    citJerusalme 150became famous. It exploded in Washington because it included a
                    great deal of detail, very significant analysis, put very dispassionately, but
                    which painted a very troubling picture of prisoner abuse and torture by the
                    Israelis. As I said, the consulate management, Newlin and Kruse, as far as I
                    know, didn't hesitate at all. They sent it right back in, and it had a
                    tremendous impact when it hit Washington and was eventually leaked into the
                    media. Of course, that didn't have to go through the embassy because we were an
                    independent consulate. If it had had to go through the embassy management, I'm
                    not quite sure what would have happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The normal response to this, particularly looking at the
                        Israeli pattern, is to try to discredit the messenger which is being done in
                        spades in the United States today. What happened in this case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The reporting officer was subject to a lot of attention and a lot of rumors
                    were put out and her relationships were examined extremely closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about male-female type relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you've got a woman making a report you can always say,
                        you know, some guy got to her or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: There were suggestions along those lines but the fact that the material had
                    come from so many different sources, who had just been there for a visa
                    interview, really made it difficult to discredit the reporting. It was rather ad
                    hominin or ad feminine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? What happened to her?</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HULL: She was eventually transferred back to Washington, I think not as any kind
                    of a disciplinary measure. I don't recall if it was on schedule or premature,
                    but she had a rather unusual personality, she was very introverted, I would say
                    not your typical diplomat, more an analyst, and she went back to Washington and
                    I'm not sure what happened to her career after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out? Did you travel extensively through the

                </p>
                <p>HULL: We traveled freely throughout the West Bank. There were very few
                    restrictions. Occasionally, when there was a security incident, there would be a
                    curfew imposed and then we would have to talk our way through the curfew or else
                    have to wait until it was lifted. We traveled very freely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How heavy at that particular time did you find the
                        handling of the Israelis on the West Bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was fairly heavy. Certainly they were watching the security situation
                    very carefully, and they were also expropriating considerable amounts of lands
                    for settlements. They had a choke hold on the economy so it was a rather
                    heavy-handed occupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spoke of expropriating lands, I have heard stories
                        either losing records or cooking up records or something. In other words,
                        land deeds going back to Ottoman times weren't recognized. Was there a lot
                        of, you might say legal hanky panky going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: There were many categories of land. The Israelis almost automatically of
                    course, claimed and disposed of any state land, land that had been controlled by
                    the Jordanian government. There was also land where Palestinians had legal deeds
                    to it which on occasion was expropriated. The vast majority of the land had been
                    Palestinian hands for generations, but there was no legal title. The British had
                    begun to register some of this land, I don't think they had gotten very far. So
                    there was a great deal of traditional land ownership and that gave the Israelis
                    a certain area in which to act in the fashion they wanted to act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find checkpoints and as an ex-enlisted man myself,
                        I know the guy who ends up on the checkpoint, particularly at night, is not
                        the best soldier. And particularly you have a citizen military and I was
                        wondering if there were problems with the troops who were doing the
                        guarding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HULL: It could get very sticky but, of course, our cars were labeled CC (consular
                    corps) so we were advertising our status and our mission. But depending on the
                    circumstance or the individual on duty, it could be a bigger or lesser problem.
                    A good tactic was to take one of the Israelis who was driving for the consulate.
                    I remember David Pinto in particular. He was an Israeli, he'd served in the
                    military, he knew the mentality, he knew Hebrew, and he could talk his way
                    through almost any checkpoint. That was often your strongest ally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to go to villages and talk to the various
                        leaders there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, because I had Arabic it was quite easy for me. Our responsibility was
                    to get out and report back to Washington on what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Camp David process? When Carter
                        came in what was the feeling at first about Carter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, early in his administration, Carter made a statement in favor of a
                    Palestinian homeland which echoed in some ways the Balfour Declaration of 1917.
                    That had a very positive echo in the West Bank. There was a feeling that this
                    was a new administration that was serious about dealing with the problem. And
                    then we watched the painful negotiations taking place to try to reconvene the
                    Geneva Conference which were running afoul of such questions as Palestinian
                    representation and how the Geneva Conference would be structured.</p>
                <p>Soon after I arrived in Jerusalem, a sea change occurred. I mentioned the
                    Palestinian elections, but you had Israeli elections and Begin was became prime
                    minister. This brought Likud to power for the first time and of course, Likud's
                    attitude toward the occupied territories, especially the West Bank, was
                    radically different from the Labor position. That side of the equation became
                    much more difficult to work. We could follow from Jerusalem the efforts being
                    made by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and people like Assistant Secretary Hal
                    Saunders and Special Mideast Envoy Roy Atherton to get the Geneva Conference
                    reconvened. There was interest in the new mayors, whether they would step up and
                    agree to represent the Palestinians which they refused to do, referring back to
                    the Rabat Summit decision that the PLO was the sole legitimate spokesman of the
                    Palestinian people. The process ground on until President Sadat in Egypt alarmed
                    the Americans by concluding that President Carter needed help and would not get
                    there on his own, and announced that he was willing to go anywhere including
                    Jerusalem in the cause of peace. We listened to this with disbelief; we couldn't
                    imagine that Sadat really meant what he said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sadat at that time was still considered somewhat of a
                        lightweight, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, I think after the 1973 War, people were no longer under-estimating
                    this fellow. Anyway, we had Sadat's offer and, of course, this had not come in a
                    vacuum. Israeli Foreign Minister Dyan had been meeting with Sadat's National
                    Security Advisor Tuhami in Morocco. These were secret contacts between the
                    Israelis and the Egyptians about which we knew nothing at the time. With
                    alacrity, Menachem Begin issued the invitation to President Sadat to come to
                    Jerusalem. They were communicating through the consulate because the Egyptians
                    had no embassy in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the Israelis had no embassy in Cairo
                    so we were playing a mediatory role.</p>
                <p>I still recall one evening I was called in because we had received a cable from
                    our embassy in Cairo which contained President Sadat's acceptance of Begin's
                    invitation to visit Jerusalem. Since I was the junior officer I was the logical
                    person to be the postman and the message was given to me. Menachem Begin was
                    speaking that evening at a large assembly hall in Jerusalem, and I was tasked to
                    take the message to that convention hall and to wait for Prime Minister Begin to
                    finish his speech and then to deliver to him President Sadat's acceptance of his
                    invitation. I thought that was a pretty cool thing for a young officer.</p>
                <p>We tracked the Sadat visit very carefully when he came to Jerusalem and, like
                    others, watched on TV as he descended the steps of the airplane and shook hands
                    with Begin and embraced former Prime Minister Golda Meir, listened to his speech
                    in the Knesset, which struck us as very orthodox in terms of Arab politics.
                    Perhaps the most important thing we were meant to do was to get Palestinian
                    reaction to the whole thing. The reaction within the West Bank and East
                    Jerusalem was relatively favorable. Sadat had said the right things, he was
                    still esteemed for what he had accomplished in the 1973 War. It was really only
                    after the PLO weighed in from Beirut excoriating Sadat that public opinion in
                    the West Bank shifted against the visit and against Sadat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the beginning of this process from the Consulate
                        General's point of view was the PLO in Beirut considered an intransigent
                        group? Not only did you have instructions we couldn't work with them, but
                        did you feel that their policy or mind set was such that they were probably
                        were undealable with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I don't think we necessarily thought that. I think given our parochial
                    perspective we thought that there were good minds, good people in the West Bank
                    and East Jerusalem whose views should count. After all these were the people
                    living under the occupation itself, they were still inside, they couldn't get
                    around to conferences or attend U.N. sessions and some of the other prerogatives
                    of the PLO leadership. I think we, at least I, felt their views deserved to be
                    heard and appreciated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you relations with the embassy in Tel Aviv? Did
                        you go down there? Was there a lot of consultation or not from your
                        part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At the top there were regular consultations between Mike Newlin and Sam
                    Lewis, and I think they worked very hard at maintaining that relationship. I
                    personally did not do as much as I should have to cultivate relations with the
                    embassy. I think that I, as a young man, was jealous of the independence of the
                    consulate and resented any possible infringements by the embassy. And I think
                    the relationships grew quite testy over time as we would be reporting things
                    that made life uncomfortable for the embassy. So it was a strained relationship
                    at my level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of it I think, would be just the normal thing. Here
                        you are the political officer in Jerusalem and you go to Tel Aviv you are a
                        very small fish in a much bigger pond, aren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It wasn't so much personal prestige or status. It was that we were living
                    in a schizophrenic world. There was very little common ground between the way
                    the Palestinians saw things and the way Israelis saw things. I think, naturally,
                    we took on some of the perceptions of the people we were dealing with primarily.
                    That meant that naturally there would be a divide between the way the embassy
                    would view events and the way the consulate would view events. I think I needed
                    and others needed to make more effort to bridge that divide.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: With suspicion. The Hashemites after 1948 had moved in and annexed the West
                    Bank and their rule over the West Bank had been heavy-handed in many ways.
                    They'd been resented. Of course, the West Bankers, most of them, were Jordanian
                    citizens and they had to be careful about how they conducted themselves, but
                    there was no love lost between West Bank Palestinians and the King.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Camp David process startewe are talking about after
                        Sadat's dramatic trip to Jerusalem. How did things work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, initially, the United States took a step back from the process,
                    because Sadat had acted to a large extent unilaterally and this of course, had
                    derailed our preferred course which was to Geneva. I think Washington decided we
                    needed to step back and see what the Israelis and the Egyptians could accomplish
                    on their own. Not much was the answer. When the summit occurred between Begin
                    and Sadat at Ismailia, it became very apparent that the two sides left to
                    themselves would get nowhere, and therefore Carter and his team re-engaged and
                    finally got the parties to Camp David. I think from my perspective it seemed
                    like very impressive diplomacy at Camp David. The Sinai was settled relatively
                    easily although the settlements were a significant issue. The real blood was
                    spilled over what happened to the West Bank and Gaza, because that's what Begin
                    did not want to give on and where Sadat needed something to maintain his
                    position in the Arab world. Of course, what we did was we took Begin's
                    suggestion of autonomy for the residents of the West Bank and Gaza, and we tried
                    to push that as far as possible towards an interim arrangement of
                    self-government which would then be followed by negotiations of the final
                    status.</p>
                <p>When I first read the Camp David Accords, I thought from a Palestinian point of
                    view, it was thin gruel. After all the Egyptians had gotten virtually all of
                    Sinai back, recovered the oil fields, the settlements would be uprooted. The
                    Palestinians got what might look like a bowl of porridge, but the Department
                    made a concerted effort to sell the Camp David Accords. Hal Saunders came out to
                    Jerusalem, and we arranged a series of meetings between Hal and some of the best
                    of the mayors, including Fahd Qawasmi and Mohammed Milhem. Hal made the rounds,
                    or perhaps they came to Jerusalem, I'm not clear, and he made a very good pitch
                    as Hal was always able to do. And again, as with Sadat's speech, the initial
                    reaction from the Palestinians was interest. They didn't rule it out, but
                    predictably in fairly short order the PLO came online from Beirut denouncing the
                    agreements, denouncing the self-government proposal, and then we found our
                    interlocutors scurrying behind the PLO's position, and we could never get
                    self-government off the ground.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about visiting groups? Israel could almost convene
                        the Congress there at one time or another. How much did they peel off over

                </p>
                <p>HULL: We saw a significant number of Congressmen who would want to hear both
                    sides of the story, and we would arrange meetings for them. We benefited from
                    that traffic.</p>

                        How much did you think of this as an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was constant. There was constant pressure from the Congress to do
                    something. We would, of course, hope that the Department would hold the line, as
                    they did largely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself being pushed in a corner by Congress
                        people who, you know, at least at that time the Arab group was nothing
                        compared to Jewish groups and particularly Jewish political contributions
                        were extremely important to a significant number of Congress people, so were
                        you sort of considered the anti-Semitic Arab lovers or something? Was this a
                        problem with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think Congress, the engaged members, were aware of what the consulate was
                    doing and were uncomfortable with what the consulate was doing so there was a
                    constant tension in that regard. We did get some sympathetic visitors. We were
                    aware of Representative Paul Finley, who was sympathetic to the Palestinian
                    perspective. We were visited by Senator Paul Simon from Illinois, who was very
                    interested in hearing both sides of the story. There were exceptions, but
                    generally we found Congressional attention more critical of us than
                    otherwise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think we were backed very well. I think the NEA Bureau and the leadership
                    of Hal Saunders, Roy Atherton by then I think had moved on and was the special
                    envoy, and even in the White House Bill Quandt was the senior director. I think
                    they were very serious, professional and fair-minded people. I never really
                    doubted the Department's position.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. There are a significant number of European countries which have
                    consulates similar to ours: the British, the French, the Spanish, the Turks have
                    a consulate there and the Greeks have a consulate there, so we had our own
                    little consular corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they play much of a role from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were active, they were interested. It was a very high profile issue.
                    The British, of course, had the legacy of the Mandate and a special position
                    therefore. Most of the consulates were active and interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the area that you had responsibility for, were there

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>HULL: Oh, yes. The Haram Sharif or, as it is known to Jews, the Temple Mount is
                    in East Jerusalem. There were sites in Hebron, notably the Mosque of Abraham
                    where the prophet is buried as is Sarah and other patriarchs. There's Rachel's
                    Tomb, which is on the outskirts of Bethlehem. There was Joseph's purported tomb
                    up in Nablus. The West Bank had many sites of religious significance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did these concern you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Oh, yes. They were flashpoints. In Hebron you'd have regular incidents at
                    the Patriarchs' Tomb and the other sites as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. It happened not infrequently in Hebron, and also in the Haram Sharif
                    area. There were significant challenges.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, if there was violence and casualties, it would be reportable. We
                    would try to keep track and try to figure out how the incident occurred, who was
                    responsible, and yes, that was part of our mandate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have sort of well-meaning Christians coming to see
                        Bethlehem and the holy spots and being in the wrong place at the wrong
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: A significant percentage of the Palestinians were Christians. Bethlehem is
                    a Christian Palestinian town. The mayor was a Christian. And Ramallah was
                    primarily a Christian town. First of all, you had Christians among the
                    Palestinians. You had Americans, also pilgrims coming in, and we would be
                    responsible for their safety and well-being. We would have to warn them if there
                    were dangerous situations, but the situation was not as dangerous as is the case
                    now when terrorism is widespread, there were real no “no-go” zones. At that
                    stage you could still travel virtually anywhere in the West Bank in relative
                    safety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine you would get the usual speecheas a former

                <p>HULL: We did have those cases. Since I wasn't doing consular work, I really
                    didn't interact very much with that element but it was certainly there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: From our perspective, they had worsened. The settlement activity had
                    expanded in a major way, and the political process had come to pretty much of a
                    dead end after Camp David. The hope that had come with the election of the
                    mayors in 1975 and the new blood, with the intense Carter negotiating efforts
                    early in his administration, all of those promises had not really produced
                    change. We left feeling that times would be tougher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did a significant other develop during this period of

                </p>
                <p>HULL: A very significant other developed. My wife, Amal, is a Palestinian. She
                    was the director of the Islamic Museum in the Haram Sharif. She had been an
                    International Visitor (IV) grantee, and therefore was on the consulate's list of
                    contacts, and we had met at one of my welcome parties. I had with great relish
                    recounted to her my experience in the Peace Corps living in Mahdia, the capital
                    of the Fatimite Dynasty, an account which she found rather quaint. Over time our
                    relationship became serious, and we married in 1978. It so happened that Vice
                    President Mondale decided to visit Jerusalem on that day. My boss, Michael
                    Newman, was always a great gentleman and gave me the day off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause any problems, having a Palestinian
                        wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think it raised many eyebrows. The Department handled it very well
                    indeed. Michael Newlin had married a Czech national during the Cold War when
                    Czechoslovakia was communist. He had had a similar personal experience, and that
                    made him sympathetic to my experience. But the Israelis found it puzzling. When
                    we went on our honeymoon, we arrived at the Ben Gurion Airport with one
                    suitcase. They looked at my American diplomatic passport, and they looked at her
                    Israeli-issued laissez passer identifying her as Palestinian, and they wanted to
                    know to whom the suitcase belonged because if it was a diplomat's suitcase it
                    would get cursory treatment, but if it was a Palestinian suitcase it would get
                    very thorough treatment indeed. We told them that it was shared which produced a
                    quandary. It was pretty clear that we made an impression. When we arrived back a
                    week later and went through the processing, our passports were requested for
                    processing and the official took one look and said, “Oh, yes, we've heard of
                    this case.” It was somewhat unusual and took some delicate handling.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, this was 1978. No, actually, I think the pressure predated it and

                <p>HULL: Yes, this is 1979 now after about four years in Jerusalem. I was recruited
                    to become the staff assistant in the Near East Bureau, me and another young man
                    out of Islamabad named Mark Grossman. (Mark had a brilliant career that included
                    Ambassador to Ankara, Director General and finally Undersecretary for Political
                    Affairs.) I think that I was spotted by the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary
                    who had come to visit us in Jerusalem and whose escort I was. Since NEA then
                    included South Asia, it was a good idea to have in the NEA front office someone
                    with Middle East experience and then someone with South Asia experience. Marc
                    Grossman and I took over from Ron Newman, later our ambassador in Bahrain and
                    Afghanistan, and Jim Collins, who ended up as our ambassador in Moscow. We
                    launched in 1979, I think it was probably September, right before the events of
                    Tehran in November.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was the staff aid in the Near East and South Asian Bureau working for
                    Assistant Secretary Hal Saunders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Hal Saunders as a person to work for and
                        how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HULL: Saunders was an impressive leader, and he, of course, was one of the major
                    architects of the Camp David process. Henry Kissinger and then Cy Vance and
                    Jimmy Carter had all come to rely upon him for his skills in analysis and
                    diplomacy. To that immense competence he married a very rare quality of
                    humanity, a very deep concern for the people with whose problems he was dealing,
                    but also concern for his staff and the Bureau. So in many ways, it was a golden
                    age in the NEA Bureau under his leadership. He made a real effort to create a
                    team in that bureau. I recall, for example, when the peace process team would be
                    prepared to launch on a trip to the Middle East, perhaps related to
                    implementation of Camp David Accords, Hal would gather in his spacious Assistant
                    Secretary's office a number of people from the bureau who were working on
                    related matters, the relevant Deputy Assistant Secretaries, the country
                    directors for Israel and relevant Arab countries, and other specialists in the
                    negotiating process. He would sit with this group and brainstorm exactly what
                    the Secretary of State or the President wanted to accomplish in this visit. He
                    would talk through a scope paper, which Mike Sterner, the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary would then draft, and the relevant supporting meeting papers and issue
                    papers. They would crystallize through that brainstorming process, a very
                    purposeful plan for that trip that would ensue. This inclusive style, I didn't
                    appreciate at the time, was rather rare in the Department of State, and more
                    often people charged with an important issue would adopt an exclusive style. For
                    example, the recent peace process teams really tried to minimize the number of
                    people involved with two effects: one, they were denied the broader expertise
                    that Hal was able to tap, and two, they alienated talented people in the bureau
                    who could make contributions, wanted to make contributions, but were never asked
                    or given the opportunity to make contributions. This inclusive team style of Hal
                    Sunders not only resulted in better morale, but also resulted in a better
                    product. Great strides in Middle East peace were made by the U.S. during that
                    period, during the Kissinger and the Vance/Carter periods. I think one reason
                    for those strides was Hal Saunders' leadership in the process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it comes to the crisis in Iran, in a way, the Near
                        Eastern Bureau's major thing has always been Israel and the Palestine
                        question, and you have lumped in the Persians and the Indian types. All of a
                        sudden this became hot. Did you see a dislocation of the thought process or
                        how the bureau reacted to something that had essentially been on the
                        periphery coming center stage? And really center stage too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HULL: Right. It was as if we were hit by successive force-five hurricanes. It was
                    a bureau that was preoccupied with the Middle East peace process. Of course, we
                    had accomplished tremendous success at Camp David, and then as you say, the Iran
                    revolution hit and that brought Iran to the forefront. Quickly thereafter, the
                    Soviets invaded Afghanistan so the whole South Asia question came in a very
                    dramatic fashion. And there was instability throughout the region, the attack on
                    the mosque in Mecca, the burning of our embassy in Islamabad, problems in Libya.
                    So the bureau was really buffeted by these diplomatic hurricanes. Its leadership
                    and everyone in the bureau scrambled to react. With Iran, I think I previously
                    mentioned that as a result of the Iranian revolution the senior management at
                    the Department shook up the NEA Bureau and brought in Peter Constable, who had
                    been Deputy Chief of Mission in Islamabad, as Principal Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary to reinforce the management. The person who really managed Iranian
                    policy was Henry Precht, who was Director for Iranian Affairs. In those days
                    Henry's influence and his activism were equally large. He took an issue which
                    was relatively neglected and because of the dynamism of his personality really
                    dominated the issue. I recall as a staff aid we could generally fend off most
                    country directors who opportuned to our bosses. We didn't have any success at
                    all fending off Henry. If he wanted something, he would find a way to get
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of learn to give way to an elemental
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: In a way to survive and also because I think we recognized that Henry was
                    doing important work, and he had a right to plead in a special way. He was
                    dealing with bosses for whom the subject wasn't as natural, say, as Israel or
                    the Arabs countries. But if Henry wanted something to happen while the Secretary
                    or the Assistant Secretary was in New York at the United Nations, he would find
                    a way to do it. I remember learning much from Henry. I later work for him when
                    he was Deputy Chief of Mission in Cairo. One thing I learned from Henry was that
                    charm is a potent diplomatic tool, and Henry would charnot staff aides, of
                    course, who weren't sufficiently importanbut certainly the secretaries of the
                    principals. He would find open doors around the building because the secretaries
                    liked him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right, the office managers who hold the keys to the kingdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand prior to the final collapse of the Shah that
                        Henry was so powerful and unswerving proponent of saying you have a real
                        problem here, that the National Security Adviser, Brzezinski, wouldn't allow
                        him to come to meetings because he would not give way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, I don't have direct experience with that. I'll leave that for others
                    who do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Henry has mentioned this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I do know that part of the debate in Washington was what we should do with
                    our embassy and the degree to which the embassy should be staffed up. And I
                    think Henry, in a proactive way, wanted a robust relationship, wanted the
                    embassy staffed robustly, and then of course, when the hostage crisis came,
                    those people were in harm's way. It added, I think, to a sense of having got
                    those people into this situation we had a responsibility to get them out of the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>There was, of course, a very intense debate about whether the Shah should be
                    allowed into the U.S. after he Iran. As I recall it, Henry and the Bureau were
                    quite against that. They foresaw ramifications for our mission in Tehran, and of
                    course, we lost that argument and others prevailed upon the President to allow
                    the Shah in. When that happened there was a collective holding of our breath,
                    and I remember there was a demonstration planned to protest his entry, and we
                    tracked it on a real time basis. It was diverted from the embassy and actually
                    passed with relatively little violence. There was a feeling of relief when that
                    occurred, but it was short-lived because within a few days the students had
                    occupied the embassy, and we had a situation where colleagues that we knew were
                    being held hostage, and of course, the whole hostage crisis, 444 days, then
                    unrolled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the students first took over the embassy was it the
                        expectation that this would be like the one on Valentine's Day before you
                        know, a day's thing or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Bruce Laingen was in the Foreign Ministry at the time, he had contact
                    with the government, there had been a precedent in which the government had
                    asserted its control, and so the initial expectation was that the situation
                    would be corrected. But as time passed it became clear that it was a whole new
                    ballgame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you weren't in the sort of analytical side of
                        things, but what were you picking up from people and Khomeini and his
                        revolutionary government?</hi>

                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>HULL: One of the perks of being a staff aide is you had access to the vault. The
                    vault in NEA was this skiff, a secure area where classified documents were
                    maintained. We had cabinet after cabinet after cabinet of classified documents
                    and one folder was NODIS and dealt with the efforts that had been made by
                    General Hauser, Deputy Commander in Chief of the European Command, to shore up
                    the Shah prior to his departure. I remember reading through some of those
                    reports and being struck by the disintegration of the Shah's regime and the
                    security services, and like a castle of sand just melting away when the waves of
                    Khomeinism struck. Although we weren't privy to all the information, we could
                    indirectly get a sense of the issues. It was very sobering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the analysis early on of this really rather
                        bizarre invasion of Afghanistan? It was sort of a communist country invading
                        another communist country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: There had been a fear for some time that the Soviets would find a way to
                    extend their power to the Persian Gulf and the oil there. When they moved into
                    Afghanistan, this was seen as a move in that direction and therefore a move not
                    just involving a client state but also a move with implications for U.S.
                    strategic interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting increasingly concerned about the strong
                        fundamentalism? It had always been kind of lurking around. All of a sudden
                        you had this popping up in Afghan, in Mecca and Islamabad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were greatly concerned about the threats to our personnel and with the
                    instability. We had a huge investment in the Saudi royal family, in part, for
                    economic reasons. At the time I think, our concern was not that a fundamentalist
                    group would grow and be able to threaten directly the United States but rather
                    that these extremists would threaten governments which were friends and partners
                    of the United States. That was the problem we had already seen with the Shah
                    ousted and so it was not a stretch of the imagination to see other “friends” of
                    the U.S. under similar pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long in the staff aide job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was there for a year. It was the most intense year of my life. Once our
                    colleagues had been taken hostage there were no more weekends or much of
                    holidays. The bureau became a 24/7/365 operation, and we gained breathing time
                    only by trading off and doing every other Sunday as opposed to every Sunday.
                    People like Hal and Peter Constable and Henry Precht virtually had no time off
                    during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way though, what was the result of this devotion to
                        duty? What was the end result?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I would argue a diplomatic success and a political failure was the end
                    result because at the end of the day after more than a year of negotiations,
                    Warren Christopher and Hal Saunders through the Algerians did negotiate a deal
                    which resulted in the safe return of the American hostages. And it really was
                    far from a giveaway in terms of other U.S. interests but rather created a
                    process that was enduring and adopted by the Reagan administration to regulate
                    our relations with Iran through that troubling period. But the unrelenting
                    attention on the hostages and the way the White House allowed it to become the
                    central foreign policy issue, I think, led to Carter's defeat and Reagan's
                    election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the aborted attempt to rescue the hostages and the
                        subsequent resignation of Cyrus Vance impact on what you all were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We knew nothing of it before it occurred. It was obviously close hold. We
                    read about it with a sense of horror, not only because of the loss of life
                    involved among the U.S. military people, but most of us believed that had they
                    got to Tehran it was highly unlikely they could have pulled this off without
                    tremendous loss of life. For us again being personally involved, knowing the
                    people who were hostages, we were against an approach that risked greatly that
                    loss of life. Cy Vance, of course, opposed it very, very strongly to the extent
                    that he resigned in its wake. We had great respect for Secretary Vance, and I
                    still recall the line that formed outside his office when he said goodbye to the
                    Department. I have never seen a longer line in the State Department. Everybody
                    wanted to shake his hand and thank him for what he had done.</p>

                    was relieved, and I chose to take the Algerian Desk which was bit unusual
                    because normally staff aides would go to desks closer to the heart of the peace
                    process (Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon). I thought the Algerians were
                    particularly important at that time, given their role in mediating the release
                    of the hostages, and I wanted to do what I could to improve U.S.- Algerian
                    relations, in part with that in mind.</p>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HULL: We had used a number of mediators. There was a lot of cloak-and-dagger
                    surrounding some of them. They were not professional diplomats, and we were just
                    driven to use these channels because we couldn't do anything directly with the
                    Iranians, and we found no official party to work through. All of those attempts
                    had failed. So when the Algerians because of their revolutionary credentials did
                    manage to connect in Tehran with people who seemed to have influence and power
                    there was great satisfaction because Warren Christopher and Hal Saunders finally
                    had some channel in which to work the problem, where they could work in a
                    professional, purposeful and effective way. So the Algerians were valued very
                    highly by the Department. They turned out to be formidable diplomats and to play
                    a very important role in resolving the issue. As I recall this was becoming
                    evident in the summer of 1980.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a little bit about what was happening in Algeria at
                        the time, the situation there and the diplomatic process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The major issue for the Algerians was the war in the Western Sahara where
                    the Polisario, a group supported by Algeria, was battling Morocco which had a
                    few years before marched into the Western Sahara to annex the territory to
                    Morocco. That was the issue most important to the Algerians. Beyond that there
                    were important issues of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Algerians were
                    supplying us with LNG to a significant extent, and we had invested a good deal
                    of money in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of government did they have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Algerians had a government that really flowed out of their
                    revolutionary experience and the National Liberation Front (the FLN) had evolved
                    into a dominant party, in a one-party state. President Bendjedid was in power, a
                    relatively benign leader, one of the very few Arab heads of state who had ever
                    given up power, but it was a state where you had a very strong single party, a
                    very strong military which again had revolutionary roots. You had a minority
                    Berber population, which was talented and somewhat restive, but you still had a
                    society where there was a good deal of cohesion and national purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see at that time any of the fundamentalist force
                        which sometime later set upon a rather vicious war?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Not at the time. I think we, of course, had seen it in places like
                    Saudi Arabia, but it was not apparent at least to me in Algeria until a bit
                    later. However, I do remember one striking thing. In the course of my
                    responsibilities I traveled to Algiers and at that time we could move around the
                    country relatively freely. I remember on Fridays seeing vast numbers of
                    Algerians overflowing the mosques and occupying adjacent streets as prayer
                    places. It was very striking to me the numbers of Algerians praying. The elite
                    was still French-educated and extremely sophisticated and French speaking, but
                    the masses were obviously were taking a different direction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there the migration to France that caused a lot of
                        problems in France today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, it was going on very much at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Algerian diplomacy. Who were the
                        diplomats and how did they develop their various skills?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, of the ambassador here was Redha Malek, who was a consummate Algerian
                    diplomat. He did not speak English and so meetings would take place in French
                    with Alec Toumayan interpreting. Alec was one in a long series of State
                    Department interpreters, like Stephanie Van Reigersberg and later Gamal Helal,
                    who were really more than interpreters. They were cultural bridges, and their
                    contributions to our diplomacy have never received adequate credit, in my view.
                    Malek himself wouldn't take a lot of notes, but at an important point in the
                    conversation he would pull an envelope out and he'd scratch a few notes to
                    himself. We soon learned he was quite a reliable interlocutor and got things
                    straight, and that Algiers would be well-informed and eventually Tehran would be
                    well-informed. He became a very, very important channel for us. At the time we
                    had Rick Haynes as our ambassador in Algiers, a non-career ambassador, but a
                    very good one and we had Chris Ross as the deputy chief of mission who knew
                    North Africa and particularly Algeria extremely well. He had excellent French
                    and excellent Arabic. We had an extremely strong team in Algiers, and the
                    Algerians had a very strong team in Washington, not just Malek, but his deputy
                    Slim Debagha. Their Foreign Ministry threw itself into the process: the Foreign
                    Minister, and his assistant ministers, some of whom died tragically in a plane
                    crash a few years afterwards. They fielded a thoroughly professional team
                    without which I doubt that the hostage crisis could have been resolved
                    successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things you pointed out that is sometimes
                        forgotten is that diplomats are judging other diplomats. And you're saying
                        you found he was an excellent interlocutor because he was accurate. One of
                        the problems sometimes being if you try to talk to another party and you
                        have an intermediary in between, they are usually putting their own spin on
                        it. In a way you were searching for somebody who was going to give you the
                        real stuff?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>HULL: We wanted a professional. We had had experience with talented amateurs who
                    had connections in Tehran who seemed to be able to influence the Iranians and
                    then had never delivered. That had been a very great investment with a great
                    deal of time and effort through those channels including White House time and
                    effort. We needed something that was more reliable, more professional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did, from your position there, when you were staff
                        aide, how did you view the White House? You know Carter, Brzezinski and all,
                        were they helpful or sort of tending to run off in different directions or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The President was extremely helpful and dedicated to resolving the hostage
                    question. Of course, Saunders had worked with him previously on Camp David so
                    there was a great deal of familiarity and respect. The whole team from Carter
                    through Vance and then Muskie after Vance left, Warren Christopher, Hal
                    Saunders, Henry Precht and, in fact Jody Powell and Ham Jordan, played important
                    roles, rather unusually given it was a foreign issue. There was this tension
                    with Brzezinski and the NSC (National Security Council) staff. Gary Sick was the
                    responsible person. State did not see eye to eye with NSC on many of the issues.
                    There was this friction, but it did not impede working with the President, I
                    think, because these people knew each other so well from the Camp David
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about particularly working on the Algerian desk, how
                        did you find the role of the French with Algiers and with the Iranian
                        crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The French, I think, like most of our friends and allies tried to be
                    helpful, but didn't have much influence. We tried every normal channel and some
                    very unusual channels to find influence in the Tehran, and no one really had
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the interesting things I think is Algeria, although
                        once you go back to Senator Kennedy, Senator Jack Kennedy, getting up and
                        making his famous talk that sent the French up the wall about how Algeria
                        should be freed and all that. We've never really been able to warm up to
                        Algeria. Even today, I mean, do you see any reason for that? Maybe I'm
                        wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HULL: We did have a warming period at this time. After the Algerians delivered on
                    the hostage issue, I and others who had worked with them, felt we needed to do
                    more in that relationship. One of the first things that we did was to allow
                    Chris Ross and me to go to Tindouf and meet with the Polisario. This had been
                    off limits, and Saunders and the others decided to go forward with it in light
                    of what the Algerians were doing for us. It also made a certain amount of sense
                    since we had learned in the Middle East that it is generally a better idea to
                    talk to all the parties in a dispute then to be one-sided. We made that trip,
                    Chris and I, and it was a great encouragement to the Algerians and to the
                    Polisario themselves although on that trip we made a special effort to interact
                    with the Moroccan prisoners of war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some are still there, aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Some are still there. We had been briefed that we would be exposed to the
                    Moroccan POWs (prisoners of war) and we hit on a plan so that meeting would not
                    be an exploitative exposure. We brought with us writing equipment, pens,
                    pencils, paper. The Moroccan POWs had been arrayed in the sun obviously for some
                    time before we were brought to the scene to examine the seized equipment and the
                    prisoners of war. What Chris and I did was, instead of just reviewing them, we
                    approached them, and we explained in Arabic that we brought paper and pencils
                    with us and, if they wanted to send messages back to their families, we would be
                    happy to take those messages. Initially, there was disbelief. They didn't know
                    how to react, but then gradually they understood the opportunity, and they broke
                    out of their ranks into these small groups, and there would be one in each group
                    who could write. They would scribble off their messages to their families. The
                    Polisario didn't know how to react. Finally after fifteen to thirty minutes,
                    they decided this was not the kind of encounter that they had planned. We
                    collected all of the messages, and I brought them back to Washington. Initially,
                    the Moroccan government had been appalled even by the idea of the visit and said
                    they had no interest in our communications, but then in a fairly short time they
                    decided that, no, they did want to facilitate the messages getting to the
                    families so we handed them over to the Moroccans. I think for many families it
                    was the first communications they had with the prisoners.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>In the grander scheme of things, my purpose was to improve U.S.-Algerian
                    relations. The visit to Tindouf was one thing we could do. Another thing we
                    could do was that the Algerians were very interested in getting C-130 aircraft.
                    I was working with Deputy Assistant Secretaries Morris Draper and Peter
                    Constable on a deal whereby the Algerians could obtain not C-130s, the military
                    version, but the civilian version of the airplane. Of course, these are
                    transport airplanes, not lethal in themselves. We were working this issue, but
                    the election occurred and, of course, the release of the American hostages
                    didn't happen until Reagan was sworn in. But then we found a new regime in the
                    White House and Al Haig as Secretary of State, and there was such animosity
                    towards the Carter Administration and such an aversion to dealing with the
                    Iranian issue or anyone associated with the Iranian issue, including the
                    Algerians, that we had this glacial chill which stopped our efforts almost dead
                    in their tracks. At the lower levels, Peter Constable and myself, we continued
                    to push because we thought the Algerians had earned this positive action on our
                    part.</p>
                <p>Finally, the new administration sent General Vernon Walters out to the area to
                    assess the situation. Walters had had long, long good relations with King Hassan
                    in Morocco, and on this trip he met President Chadli Bendjedid in Algiers.
                    Walters was a consummate diplomat, a gifted linguist, and one of the most
                    original envoys I have ever met. He would fly commercial airplanes with no
                    regard to his personal security or perks of the job. He would just go and get
                    the job done. So Vernon Walters was designated to go out and have a look at the
                    situation. I remember the battles over the talking points because there was a
                    very strong Moroccan lobby in the Department that didn't want to give an inch,
                    and therefore drafting the talking points for the visit was a rather agonizing
                    experience. General Walters said at one point he didn't care who drafted the
                    talking points; what he cared about was who delivered the talking points, and
                    Vernon Walters would decide how those talking points were delivered. I learned
                    something from that. So General Walters made his trip and he came back. General
                    Walters saw that we had an opportunity with Algeria, and he liked Bendjedid. He
                    told me that Bendjedid reminded him of his father, and he wanted to do something
                    to improve the relationship. So Vernon Walters put his shoulder behind the L-100
                    airplane deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The L-100 being the?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HULL: The civilian equivalent to the C-130. So Vernon Walters came back and
                    dipped his oar in the water and lo and behold, the action memo, which had been
                    languishing for months, came back from Secretary Haig with an approved sign on
                    it. I got word of it quickly. (Staff aide generally establish their own
                    communication network that somehow race ahead of the official notice) So, I got
                    word of this and ran up to Peter Constable and told him that we had finally
                    gotten a decision. I had press guidance so that we could announce it that day,
                    lest any of the Moroccan lobby in the Department try to reverse it. Peter
                    initially was skeptical and wanted to make sure before he signed off on a public
                    statement, and I produced for him the actual document with Al Haig's OK. Peter
                    agreed, and we did announce it. We made the deal, and we felt that the Algerians
                    had got not only a symbolic, but also a more tangible expression of thanks for
                    their good work. Generally, I think at least as long as any of us who had been
                    engaged in the hostage crisis were around, the Algerian embassy received a very
                    warm welcome in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned something which over the course of twenty
                        years that I've been doing interviews comes back again and again and that is
                        how King Hassan sort of captured particularly our ambassadors. If he felt
                        somebody like Dick Parker was a little too objective he'd get him PNG'd
                        (persona non grata). Particularly political appointees just lapped it up,
                        for example, the ambassador would say, “Our King” in his telegrams. Would
                        you talk a little bit about being the Algerian desk officer against this
                        mighty Moroccan machine in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: You're right. Of course, the Dick Parker story is the classic one.
                    Personally, I had not only the general situation, but when the Reagan
                    Administration came in, Carl Coon was made head of North African affairs. Carl
                    was a professional diplomat and competent, but he was very-one sided on this
                    question. He was very pro-Moroccan. I think Carl came in with a determination
                    not to allow what the Algerians had done in the Iranian crisis to threaten the
                    U.S.- Moroccan relationship. I got my wings clipped pretty short by Carl, and I
                    maneuvered within that constraint for the rest of my term as Algerian desk
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about the Polisario. One, what was
                        the general feeling about the cause? Was there a right and a wrong or was it
                        just one of these Middle Eastern things and who the Polisarios were as we
                        saw them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>HULL: At that time I think people were divided on the issue. There was a group
                    that felt the Moroccans had been high-handed in their Green March to seize
                    control of the Western Sahara and that legally we were constrained by that
                    illegal occupation in what we could do with Morocco. There was the other camp
                    that was willing to turn a blind eye to the international legal questions
                    involved and to put greater value on the historic U.S.- Moroccan relationship.
                    As I said, anything dealing with the Western Sahara was very hotly contested
                    within the Department and very problematic. Chris Ross and I had spent about
                    three days with the Polisario in Tindouf. They struck one as extremely competent
                    warriors, and we traveled with them in the desert, and I think into the Western
                    Sahara, truth be told, in their jeeps and vehicles which they could not only
                    drive with remarkable skill but could maintain with remarkable skill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they Berbers mainly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They are Arabs from the Western Sahara. They had their own dialect of
                    Arabic, their camps around Tindouf were extremely well-disciplined and orderly,
                    they had projects for the women, and they were living in an extremely austere
                    environment. They struck one as a revolutionary, disciplined, competent
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've always been troubled by the prisoner issue because
                        there are people who have been in prison or POWs for 30 years or so. We sent
                        missions out, I know Inderfurth went out with a group later on and was able
                        to get some released. We've made efforts, but what's their point of view of
                        keeping these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think the Polisario feel they have very few levers vis-�-vis the
                    Moroccans, and I think the prisoners are viewed as a lever to influence Moroccan
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a winner or a loser in this thing? At the time
                        you are talking about was basically a stabilized border? Had the berm been
                        built?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No. There was a more dynamic situation. It was still, I think, undecided
                    how it was going to turn out. The Moroccans were taking some painful losses, but
                    the Moroccan rulers were still pouring investment into El Aaiun, the capital in
                    the Moroccan-controlled area, which I also visited on the trip. I think the
                    turning point came with the construction of the berm and the enclosure of “the
                    Sahara utile” (the useful Sahara). That structure increased Polisario casualties
                    in a way that the Polisario, because of their very limited numbers and limited
                    resources, could not easily absorb.</p>

                        to which the Algerians were feeding troops into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We saw no indication of Algerian troops in the camps. Chris Ross probably
                    knew Algeria as well as anybody non-Algerian, and Chris never had that
                    impression.</p>

                        was no particular problem with Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Nothing that was, to my knowledge, pressing. Later on, of course, the rise
                    of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria would be very much of a concern to the
                    Tunisians, but that was later in the nineties.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: I would leave the Libya discussion for later when I was actually assigned
                    to Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was our embassy able, you say Chris Ross and I take it the

                        Algiers and all that? Were these two distinct areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I traveled with Chris a bit in Algeria. You did have different areas. The
                    cities, Oran or Algiers itself, were in some ways very similar to European
                    cities whereas the hinterlands were very Algerian. Then you had the Berber
                    regions which were distinctive in themselves. Yes, you could distinguish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again this is with very superficial knowledge, but it
                        seems that Algeria and much of that area had been sort of the breadbasket of
                        the Roman empire at one point. The French had seemed to do a pretty good job
                        with agriculture. What was the situation? Were Algerians as Algerians able
                        to move into, to continue the agricultural side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HULL: Culturally, the Algerians were trying to Arabize. There had been great
                    efforts to introduce in Arabic into the education system. They had brought in a
                    lot of Egyptian teachers, for example. The dominant issue, I think, was economic
                    and the Algerian government was following a socialist model and was failing
                    miserably in developing the country economically. The oil and, even more
                    important, the gas deposits were perhaps a hindrance in this regard because they
                    provided a lifeline economically that forestalled the kinds of reforms that were
                    needed. The housing was shabby and there was a great dearth of it. We had the
                    earthquake that occurred to which we responded with alacrity. One of the
                    impressions that you got in looking at the earthquake damage was how flimsy the
                    housing constructed by the government actually was and how bitter the people
                    felt that their basic needs were not being met by their government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody says the Egyptians are a lot of fun to work
                        with, no matter what government they have. But to the Algerians, fun does
                        not seem to be an operative word. I don't know. Do you have any feel on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think there is a revolutionary angst and then socialist seriousness that
                    did dampen spirits a bit, although people like Redha Malek and his impressive
                    wife (an activist in Algeria's revolution) were very gracious and very
                    hospitable. But overall, no, you certainly didn't have the “joie de vivre” that
                    you find in a place like Egypt. On the other hand, I must say political humor in
                    Algeria to some extent echoed the humor in Egypt. You had very acerbic political
                    cartoons and caricatures. So the Algerians were not devoid of a sense of
                    humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the desk when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I left the desk in 1982, the summer of 1982.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1982, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I went to Cairo, Egypt. It was very soon after the assassination of Anwar
                    Sadat. Our embassy was growing by leaps and bounds because of the Camp David
                    process and the peace treaty with Israel. The Egyptians were being shunned by
                    the Arab world. It was a place where there was tremendous diplomatic action. It
                    was also an embassy that was headed by Roy Atherton who was a legend in NEA.
                    Henry Precht was the Deputy Chief of Mission, and he too was legendary. He had
                    ended up in Cairo as a consolation prize when the Congress had refused to
                    confirm him as ambassador to Mauritania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>HULL: Henry was held responsible for the loss of Iran. As happens in Washington,
                    an individual will be singled out and, although immensely competent, will be in
                    this way punished by the legislative branch. NEA certainly felt Henry had done
                    yeoman's work and felt that he had earned an embassy and not being able to give
                    him his own embassy, they did the next best thing which was to make him number
                    two at one of the most important embassies in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mauritania is not exactly a prize.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, but I think for most diplomats an ambassadorship is the brass ring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation, this was in early Mubarak when you
                        got there and what was the political-economic situation in relation to the
                        United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My job in Cairo was political-military officer. I had no military
                    background, I had been Peace Corps. But I remember that Skip Gnehm (later
                    Ambassador to Australia and Jordan and Director General of the Foreign Service),
                    whom I knew since his days in Damascus, had always felt that to be a good
                    diplomat you really needed to understand the U.S. military, and you had
                    understand military matters. I was very happy to have this job in Cairo which
                    was then initiating the largest military assistance program that we had anywhere
                    in the world. I arrived with a beard. I had had a summer vacation and started a
                    beard. I met General Ed Tixier who was a U.S. Air Force major general, a very
                    interesting character in his own right and immensely competent, about six foot
                    four, very much a general in bearing, in intelligence, and in demeanor. Shortly
                    after I'd arrived my boss who was Political Counselor Tom Carolyn came to me and
                    said, “Edmund, there's one problem. General Tixier is not comfortable with your
                    beard.” So I told Tom the beard would be gone by tomorrow morning. That was the
                    right thing to do, and I was soon adopted by the U.S. military in Cairo as one
                    of their own and was invited to all General Tixier's staff meetings and had
                    total access to him and very good relations across the board with the army, air
                    force, and navy people. It also gave me a chance to get to know Minister of
                    Defense Abu Ghazala, Chief of Staff Orabi and many Egyptian military
                    personalities. And in those days even more than now, the political leadership in
                    Egypt was rooted in the military. Nasser, of course, had been a colonel and the
                    revolution of 1952 had been to a military undertaking. The Egyptian military in
                    1982 retained a dominant influence in Egyptian politics. So it was a very good
                    vantage point from which to look at things more broadly in the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you find, this must have been an emerging
                        educational experience of a Foreign Service Officer having not come out of
                        the military or had your time in the military. Were you able to take what
                        amounted to a quick course in military matters as far as getting out and
                        learning? What kind of the plane was that, what do they do, and how does
                        this work that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, the assignment was like a graduate program in military affairs with
                    its faculty General Tixier and then his successor Air Force Brigadier General
                    Stan Musser and then on down the line through the colonels. The U.S. military is
                    one of our par excellence institutions for teaching leadership and inducing
                    leadership so I learned a great deal about that. And then I learned a great deal
                    about weapons and F-4s and F-16s and M-1 tanks and I-Hawk missiles. It was
                    ironic, at the time we had one of the best defense attaches in the business,
                    Colonel Dick Underwood, running that operation. But the Office of Military
                    Cooperation, the security assistance office, was really the office that had the
                    insights and experience with the Egyptian military because they were working
                    with these Egyptians day in and day out. The Egyptians had billions of dollars
                    to spend, they wanted the latest and greatest. The technology vastly exceeded
                    their ability to operate it or maintain it. We were constantly struggling to
                    bring the logistic support and the operating skills of the Egyptians on a par
                    with the kind of technology that was pouring into Egypt. A lot of the security
                    assistance advisers got extremely frustrated with this mismatch. Some called the
                    mission: “Kicking sand.” We were constantly counseling patience and forbearance
                    and trying to help the Americans in this strange environment function
                    effectively.</p>
                <p>One of the things I did early on was to read Mohamed Hassanein Heikal's book,
                    Sphinx and Commissar, which was an insider's account of what went wrong in the
                    Egyptian-Soviet military relationship. You remember the Soviets were kicked out
                    of Egypt in 1973, prior to the war. They had been there for about five years or
                    more. One of my intents was to learn from the Soviet experience and not have us
                    repeat the mistakes the Soviets made. At the time there were dire predictions,
                    including by people as knowledgeable as Herman Eilts, a legendary former
                    ambassador, who did not think that the United States could sustain this kind of
                    intensive military relationship with the Egyptians. Yet, we have sustained that
                    relationship, and we are still there with a great presence. I think we did have
                    success in that regard in shaping that relationship so that both sides found it
                    tolerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you see as some of the problems the Soviets
                        had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Soviets would take bases in Egypt and turn them into Soviet bases, and
                    the Egyptians would not be allowed in. There was no greater affront to an
                    Egyptian than to be told you can't go somewhere in your own country. We never
                    did that. We had only one location, Wadi Qena, which Sadat offered for
                    contingencies related to the Iran hostage issue and which we kept secret, but
                    even there the Egyptians had access. I think that was the most important step
                    that we took.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Secondly, the Soviets kept the Egyptians at arm's length. They really could not
                    interact whereas Americans for all of our faults and all of our shortcomings, we
                    are not pretentious people. The U.S. military are salt of the earth and can
                    relate in very personal ways to whomever they have to relate.</p>
                <p>I think the third thing we did well was professional education and training in
                    the U.S. The Egyptians who had gone to schools in the Soviet Union had almost
                    uniformly very negative experiences. They were discriminated against. The
                    Egyptians who went to U.S. military schools almost uniformly had positive
                    experiences. They were welcomed. They were dealt with as equals, and they came
                    back from those experiences favorably impressed.</p>
                <p>There were at least three issues which challenged the relationship. They were
                    nuclear warship transits of the Suez Canal, the proposed base at Ras Banas and
                    host nation support for Gulf contingencies. The first issue, nuclear transit of
                    the Suez Canal, was very, very important to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We needed to be able to move nuclear aircraft carriers from the
                    Mediterranean into the Gulf. For Gulf contingencies, we would at times need more
                    than one carrier. To move that carrier around Africa or from the Pacific Ocean
                    to the Gulf took too much time. We wanted from the Egyptians an agreement that
                    we could do this. We invested a great deal of diplomatic capital in this effort.
                    I remember Assistant Secretary Nick Veliotes came out to Egypt and spent days
                    working with, I believe it was, Presidential Advisor Osama al Baz on the
                    Egyptian side trying to hammer out an agreement. We failed. I still remember I
                    was the reporter for the meetings, and I had voluminous accounts of the
                    discussion on this issue. What it came down to was the Egyptians would not
                    formalize an agreement, and yet the Egyptians would give us a political promise
                    that when we needed to do this we would be able to do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a don't ask, don't tell type
                        situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>HULL: Or, “knock and it shall be open to you.” Our wisdom in that regard was to
                    go with the political promise and not insist on the formal agreement. Of course,
                    the formal agreement could have been revoked. There would have been some kind of
                    provision for cancellation so it itself was not a guarantee. In the event, the
                    political promise has always served us in good stead. We have moved carriers
                    through the Suez Canal as needed. That was the first issue; the second issue was
                    Ras Banas. Sadat had offered the U.S. administration a base at the extreme
                    southeast corner of Egypt. In the wake of the Soviet move in Afghanistan, we had
                    formed the Central Command because we had defined oil supplies in the Gulf as a
                    vital U.S. interest. The Central Command was developing extensive contingency
                    plans to deal with the possibility of a Soviet move further south into the
                    Persian Gulf. They needed and wanted bases that would get them to the Gulf, and
                    Sadat had offered this base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is on the Red Sea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This is on the Red Sea. So we began a negotiation to re-construct Ras
                    Banas, and it involved the U.S. Corps of Engineers, and again we got immersed in
                    an agonizing discussion. It boiled down to: Who was going to do the work? We
                    wanted the U.S. Corps of Engineers to do the work and the Egyptians demanded
                    that the Egyptian equivalent do the work. Washington would not give on this. I'm
                    not sure if it was Washington politics about getting work for the Corps of
                    Engineers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Corps of Engineers being an extremely politically
                        powerful group in Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Or whether it was a question of standards. We didn't think the
                    Egyptians could meet our standards. But the irony of course, was we were using
                    Egyptian air bases in the interim and Cairo West right outside of Cairo most
                    notably. For some reason, Egyptian standards seemed to work well in those
                    instances, but we could not accept it if we were going to develop a base, pretty
                    much from scratch at Ras Banas. So that failed and what we found ourselves doing
                    instead was using existing Cairo military bases, particularly Cairo West, which
                    we then improved instead of Ras Banas. That may have been a blessing in
                    disguise. If we had sunk hundreds of millions of dollars into Ras Banas we might
                    have taken “ownership” of it and then really created a serious bone of
                    contention with the Egyptians.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The third issue was host nation support. Washington sent out teams to discuss the
                    kind of host nation support we would want from Egypt were we deploying U.S.
                    military forces to confront a Soviet move to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. military
                    in their war planning developed worst case scenarios and maximum wish lists. The
                    team coming out from Washington had a wish list that was absolutely mind
                    boggling. Control of Cairo's International Airport, virtually diverting
                    petroleum products for U.S. needs, an array of measures so that the Egyptians, I
                    think, were just stunned. We received a polite hearing from the Egyptians, and
                    then we received an Egyptian no which was not direct but rather no answer until
                    after a very, very long time we finally understood that we were being turned
                    down. So CENTCOM obviously had to work around this in forming our contingency
                    plans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you that CENTCOM at that time was pretty responsive
                        and knowledgeable about the Middle East things, and it was more the
                        Pentagon, you know the people of the top, who make these plans thinking
                        every country will give in. Did you see a discrepancy between the two or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Not so much. I didn't see it anyway. I think CENTCOM was still on its
                    learning curve at this state. It didn't have the area experience it has now. The
                    host-nation-support negotiations were actually handled by the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff representative Air Force Major General “Click” Smith, and he was really
                    shooting for the moon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I find that talking to people so often one of the
                        major bones of contention is base agreements. Lawyers from the Pentagon will
                        ask for everything. In a way, it's always a non-starter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I certainly agree that that is the tendency. I thought with Ras Banas the
                    embassy was negotiating the agreement, and we were doing voluminous reports back
                    to Washington and getting detailed instructions, very time consuming and it was
                    also very nitty gritty and detail-oriented. In retrospect, I think a much more
                    productive approach would have been for us to strike the best deal we could and
                    then give it to Washington as a take-it or leave-it proposition. I think Henry,
                    who was directing the negotiations, wanted cover from Washington. He didn't want
                    to do anything that would leave the embassy open to the charge that we had
                    somehow sold out U.S. interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing with the military there? Were you
                        conscience of all the time that you were being monitored by the Israeli
                        military to make sure that you weren't making the Egyptians too good?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, the Israeli presence was very limited in Cairo. They had an embassy,
                    but they were circumscribed. But the monitoring I think took place in Washington
                    with any kind of arms proposal. Having a peace treaty did make a huge
                    difference. We were pouring billions of dollars of equipment in and the Israelis
                    were not contesting this as they were contesting say, AWACS for Saudi Arabia or
                    F-15s for Saudi Arabia. The peace treaty made a huge difference. My sense was,
                    no, the Israelis were not seriously opposing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you gaining from your American military
                        colleagues about the Egyptian military. I read some time ago an account, I
                        think it was a military attach�, who had served in the Middle Eastern
                        countries and pointed out that the training is a different mind set. You
                        teach a lieutenant how to operate an artillery piece or something he will
                        generally in the Middle East keep that knowledge to himself and dole it out,
                        whereas we make sure the sergeants and corporals can take over. In the
                        Middle East, knowledge is power and you don't diffuse it. Were there any
                        aspects of this that you noticed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, not only knowledge being power, but spare parts being power or access
                    to the base being power. There was just this general reticence to engage in
                    teamwork and reticence to use up resources. There was a hoarding mentality, an
                    accountability mentality and whether or not the military could perform was a
                    secondary concern. Egypt, like most Middle Eastern countries, suffers greatly
                    from not having an NCO (non-commissioned officer) corps so you have the officers
                    at the top who often will not get their hands dirty and then recruits at the
                    bottom who are there for a few years but then move on. So it was very hard to
                    develop a trained, enduring cadre of technicians. Our people were extremely
                    frustrated with a system so different than the U.S. system. It was a very great
                    challenge to our people to engage with it effectively. More than once our
                    trainers would go out and “kick sand” in frustration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know I interviewed Admiral Crowe who at one time was
                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and when he was with the his
                        equivalent in the Soviet military the Russian was saying, you know, your
                        great strength is in your non-commissioned officers corps which is true. I
                        have served in the military, and I know. The sergeants are the people you
                        are relying on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right, quite true. We could never convince the Egyptians to take a serious
                    effort to develop that corps.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: It may relate to their class system. When you don't have much of a middle
                    class then it is more natural perhaps to have the aristocratic officers and the
                    plebian enlisted.</p>

                <p>HULL: We loved Egypt. We extended in Egypt. After three years as political
                    military officer, I took over as the deputy political counselor at the
                    embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Until 1986. There were security concerns, of course. This was a very active
                    period of terrorism so we lived with that, but we enjoyed Egypt as a cornucopia
                    of culture. We enjoyed all of that, we learned to ride horses, we enjoyed the
                    Red Sea, we enjoyed trips out to the oases, we thoroughly enjoyed the country.
                    It was a factor in my decision to come back as Deputy Chief of Mission in the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to when you arrived, Sadat was assassinated by

                        you like to talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Of course, when Sadat was assassinated, I remember I was up on the Hill and
                    got the news which shocked Congress.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Hill being Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. I heard first-hand accounts of the assassination when I got out to
                    Cairo. Of course, our ambassador, Roy Atherton, had been standing very close to
                    Sadat, and he was very much involved in absorbing the psychological blow and
                    working with Mubarak, who took over. Mubarak, of course, now looms large, but at
                    the time Mubarak was considered a joke as a Vice President. His nickname among
                    Egyptians was La Vache Qui Rit after the French processed cheese because the cow
                    depicted vaguely resembled Mubarak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sadat had been too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>HULL: As Sadat had been under Nasser. Osama Baz, who, I think, is probably the
                    most intelligent man in Egypt, once explained to me the phenomenon that occurs
                    when the successor takes over. He very quickly takes on the Pharaonic aura and
                    deference begins and then grows until he becomes this almost Pharaonic figure in
                    the political establishment, a little bit like the American politician who
                    succeeds in being elected as President.</p>
                <p>At the time Mubarak had some very strong partners. Defense Minister Abu Ghazala
                    was a formidable individual. He spoke English, he was very gregarious, he was
                    very dynamic, he was reshaping the Egyptian military using the U.S. connection
                    to do so and getting the Egyptian military into a lot of areas including civil
                    construction. The Egyptians were confronting this Islamic challenge, which
                    peaked with the assassination of Sadat. Heikal described the phenomenon in his
                    book Autumn of Fury. In the last days of the Sadat regime, one of Sadat's
                    mistakes was to try to repress all opposition, extreme and otherwise. He had
                    rolled up not only Islamic critics, but moderate critics including Heikal
                    himself. Heikal had spent a good time bit of time in an Egyptian jail with the
                    Islamics, and therefore in his typical journalistic fashion turned this
                    experience into a fascinating book about this challenge. We watched the Egyptian
                    government try to cope with this, and they did so by a combination of very tough
                    security measures which the Egyptians are good at and a certain loosening up by
                    Mubarak from the excesses of the Sadat era. The Egyptian people themselves have
                    a lot at stake in extremism not triumphing because the Egyptian economy relies
                    to a significant extent on tourism. Also the American connection was important,
                    Not only the military but also the economic aid that we were pouring in was very
                    important to the Egyptian economy.</p>
                <p>One of the trickiest moments of that period was in 1985 when the Egyptian police
                    force revolted. That was prompted by a measure to increase deductions from their
                    pay that ended up being a pay cut, and the Egyptian police rioted. It was a very
                    tense time. The riots extended to Maadi, which is the suburb in Cairo where most
                    Americans were living and where the American school was located, and therefore
                    embassy people calling home could hear gunshots in the background and knew that
                    firefights were taking place around the school where their kids were. The
                    Egyptians clamped down with a curfew, and we expected chaos and were surprised
                    to find that the Egyptian public responded with great discipline,
                    uncharacteristic discipline, and the curfew was very effective. The military
                    under Abu Ghazala was called out to put down the police rebellion. I had
                    previously recommended my parents come out for a visit so they were visiting us
                    during this time and could watch the events on the street from our balcony
                    overlooking the Nile. I always thought that my father had a dim view of my
                    political judgment in the wake of that welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were having this tremendous buildup of the military.
                        What was it for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>HULL: It was so the Egyptians could show their people and the other Arabs that
                    their peace treaty with Israel paid off and did not neuter them in terms of
                    their military capabilities or their influence in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that the Egyptians would have a lot of T-72s
                        and whatever MiGs there were. What did they do with them? You know, pretty
                        soon you start running out of parts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Many in the Egyptian military loved their Soviet equipment. They were
                    familiar with it. It was simple to operate. , It was simple to maintain. It was
                    in many ways the ideal equipment for the Egyptian military, and they were
                    attached to these items. They did make an effort to keep them running. It was so
                    common throughout the world that you could get parts for most of it. We couldn't
                    help them very much doing it although we helped a bit. We had some expertise in
                    Soviet equipment, but there was this lure of the latest and greatest, the
                    highest tech so the prestige went to the fighters, to the pilots who flew the
                    F-16s, not the MiGs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember talking to somebody who was doing the same kind
                        of the work that you were doing at one point and taking an Egyptian who
                        wasn't too familiar into warehouse to show him the inventory you needed to
                        maintain F-16s. It's mind-boggling and to have a little part ready in a
                        hurry; inventory control is one of the unheralded military disciplines. It
                        is absolutely essential.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Absolutely. The Egyptians were still doing it with file cards in warehouses
                    and finding a part or getting a part released was a major undertaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Oh, yes. We've made great efforts at IT (information technology) and
                    logistics. Our people, the American military, of course were true believers in
                    this regard and understand it's the sinews of power. The Egyptians were tough
                    sells.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1982 to 1986 period. It was a time
                        when intelligence technology particularly computer work in inventories and
                        information was just beginning to really hit the world. Some countries
                        really take to it, obviously the Indians do and the Chinese. How did you
                        find the Egyptians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was slow, uphill. They liked the control. They liked to have those parts
                    on the shelves, they liked to have the cards. They liked to be able to
                    demonstrate to their bosses that they had used up nothing, so it was
                    counter-cultural to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One doesn't think of inventory control as being a key part
                        of military effectiveness but it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our equipment is more complicated whereas a lot of the
                        Soviet equipment I think, you could sort of cast in sand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: But the Soviet stuff was a perfect match for the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told when the Soviets first came in they were asked
                        what the war plans were. Well, you do this and you do that and then you
                        wait. So what are you waiting for? You wait for winter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Winters are very mild in Egypt. I asked who was the enemy. We all asked
                    that same question. The real enemy was Israel. No one knew whether the peace
                    treaty was going to actually work out but the Egyptians couldn't say the enemy
                    was Israel so we had this elaborate phantom, and then we had a convenient enemy,
                    Libya. Libya was in our bad books, and the Libyans had provoked the Egyptians.
                    So we got elaborate scenarios, threat assessments, involving Libya. The White
                    House, under Reagan and with Admiral Poindexter as his Advisor for National
                    Security Affairs, had its own scores to settle with Libya. The La Belle Disco
                    attack occurred, we bombed Libya.</p>
                <p>A move arose in the White House to settle the Libyan account once and for all,
                    and the way they wanted to do that was to have the Egyptians invade and replace
                    Qadhafi. Admiral Poindexter and members of his staff flew out in a highly secret
                    mission to Egypt, met with Mubarak, and proposed this. By this time Nick
                    Veliotes was ambassador and Nick as Assistant Secretary had had great battles
                    with Al Haig and had just barely survived until Al Haig's replacement. But Nick
                    Veliotes was a tough-minded ambassador who knew Washington. After Poindexter
                    left, we met and the meeting included me and Henry and the intelligence liaison
                    people. We looked at the proposal and thought it was a loser. We knew not only
                    what the political sentiments were in Egypt, which were not that hostile to
                    Libya, but we also knew the capabilities of the Egyptian military and that this
                    could easily turn into a debacle.</p>
                <p>This whole military establishment was pointed eastward not westward so you would
                    have had to redeploy significant forces and then you would have had to sustain
                    these forces as they moved.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really more a supply problem. I mean, I would
                        imagine that the Libyans would be kind of a joke as far as fighting you
                        know, a regular battle but it would be mainly being able to bring up new
                        troops. Wasn't that the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, at one level it was that and then at the political level it would
                    have been the problem of one Arab government ousting another Arab government
                    which we found out in when Saddam invaded Kuwait is not viewed very favorably by
                    the Arab world.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we made this assessment and as part of this assessment, I took out a
                    Michelin map of northeast Africa, and I showed Ambassador Veliotes the practical
                    problems entailed in this proposal. The ambassador loved my presentation and
                    said, “You're going back to Washington, and you're going to make this
                    presentation in Washington. “ Here was Nick Veliotes and these were the days of
                    course of “Irangate” when the NSC was playing fast and loose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Ollie North and all this sort of thing. It was a
                        very peculiar time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was a very peculiar time, and I think one of the things in Ambassador
                    Veliotes' mind was I'm dealing directly here with the National Security Council,
                    I've got the adviser out here talking to President Mubarak. How much does
                    Washington, the State Department know about this? And how do I get my embassy
                    protected and how do we make sure the voices of reason in Washington have what
                    they need as these issues are discussed back there? So he hit upon the solution
                    of sending me back to Washington. And I went back to Washington, I didn't want
                    to go because I meant to go on vacation at the time but I was dutiful and I went
                    back and I arrived in NEA, and I met with Arnie Raphael who was then principal
                    deputy assistant secretary and I made my presentation to Arnie Raphael. Arnie
                    was the consummate bureaucratic politician, and he had an ambassador in Cairo
                    that needed this story told, he had a White House that didn't want the State
                    Department particularly involved in the issue and he had a very, very junior
                    person here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What rank were you at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was, I think, an Foreign Service 03 officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be about a major.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Very junior. So Arnie sent me off to a little make-work job preparing a
                    written brief and then ultimately arranged for me to meet with the under
                    secretary for political affairs, who would have been one of the State
                    Department's interfaces with the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Michael Armacost.</p>
                <p>So I ended up at the end of the week meeting with the undersecretary, making the
                    presentation in the small time he had available and then feeling that I had done
                    my duty and headed back to the Middle East.</p>
                <p>In the event, Mubarak and Abu Ghazala also had a rather dim view of this
                    enterprise, and we waited and we waited and we waited for a response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Egyptian no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hall: Right. The CIA to its credit also recognized the flaws in this approach.
                    Langley was responsible for recruiting the fifth column. Libyans who would
                    support the invasion. Our local professionals, who knew the Libyan opposition,
                    had great doubts about their wherewithal so Langley also probably leaned against
                    this one. And so Poindexter's grand initiative to replace Qaddafi didn't washed,
                    and I have always believed that President Reagan and the American people were
                    spared an embarrassing failure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any view from the undersecretary where he was
                        coming out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No. I think Armacost was in a listening mode and not inclined to reveal his
                    thoughts to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a fascinating insight into how things worked,
                        particularly at that time where you had this, you know, you might say the
                        major branches of government were in considerable suspicion of the NSC. What
                        about our military? I mean, our attaches, the ones who knew about the
                        capabilities. Were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were very dubious. And we got no bite from CENTCOM., although in this
                    case it probably would have been EUCOM as the supported command Libya was in
                    their Area of Responsibility. But we got no push from the U.S. military, and
                    this little war never happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Libyans doing anything nasty at the time or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were always</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vis-�-vis the Egyptians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They were always rhetorically nasty, of course. They were in the lead of
                    the Arabs trying to isolate Egypt from the Arabs post Camp David, and hence
                    Qaddafi was posturing as the new Nasser which Egyptians found laughable. There
                    were some pinpricks, but nothing that amounted to a casus belli.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Sudan a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Sudan was not. The Egyptians were very interested in Sudan because of the
                    Nile River. They felt kind of a big brother toward Sudan. They wanted the
                    correct thing to happen in Khartoum in ways that would be compatible with
                    Egyptian interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess there were no relations with Syria at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Most of the Arab world was boycotting Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that make much difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It did. The Egyptians felt rejected, but the reaction was to reinforce
                    their own feeling of superiority vis-�-vis the other Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, in talking to the Egyptians, did they really
                        feel Arab?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, ironically they felt super Arab. Nasser, of course, had invented Arab
                    nationalism and that was an Egyptian product. But they were Arabs, and they were
                    more than Arabs. They also had this long pharaonic tradition of which they were
                    very proud. Boutros Boutros-Ghali used to have his theories of concentric
                    circles where Egypt would be playing a leading role not only vis-�-vis the Arab
                    world but also the African world and then the Islamic world and then the
                    non-aligned world and the thing in common here was Egyptian leadership in all of
                    these.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Boutros Boutros-Ghali was the foreign minister at the

                </p>
                <p>HULL: He was the minister of state for foreign affairs which was the number
                    two.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the military point of view during the time you were
                        there how did the American military view Mubarak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The American military loved Defense Minister Abu Ghazala, and they
                    respected Mubarak. I think Mubarak came across to all visitors, not only the
                    U.S. military but U.S. Congressman as well, as direct, candid and a friend of
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Saudi connection? I mean, obviously the
                        Saudis were on the Arab side but was there any other spillover? Saudi Arabia
                        has always had a considerable number of Egyptian teachers and administrators
                        and people at the professional level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. And that was more or less maintained, and the Saudis kept coming to
                    Egypt, to Cairo during the holidays and during the summer for relief from the

                <p>HULL: It was stable. There were things going on. There were the disengagements
                    and withdrawals from the Sinai. The MFO (Multinational Force and Observers), the
                    peacekeeping operation, the non-UN peacekeeping operation. in the Sinai was
                    doing its job and doing it well. You had the Taba first negotiations and then
                    arbitration to resolve the issue of who would have Taba, which eventually was
                    restored to Egypt.</p>

                    and others had hoped to maintain after the peace agreement, but that was working
                    out in Egypt's favor. During the Reagan Administration, there was not a great
                    deal of effort to build Middle East peace so it was a bit of a period of
                    stagnation in terms of the peace process, except for implementing the

                <p>My wife had been curator of the Islamic Museum in Jerusalem when we got married
                    and had given up that position and to some extent her career. True, she had been
                    able to get a master's degree at the American University in Cairo in Islamic art
                    history during our stay there, but she wanted to do further work in Oxford, and
                    I felt we should do everything possible to make that happen. I also felt after
                    seven years in the Foreign Service with intensive time in Jerusalem, very
                    intensive time back in Washington during the hostage crisis and four pretty
                    tough and demanding years in Cairo when we not only worked hard but there was a
                    good deal of risk involved, we deserved some time off. The department had a
                    national security studies program that sent people for a year to places like
                    Harvard or the University of Maryland. I had, however, talked to visitors and
                    had heard a great deal about Michael Howard, who was one of Thatcher's most
                    important advisers and who was really on the Kissinger level in terms of his
                    stature and his works. And so I had taken it into my mind to try to get to
                    Oxford and to work with him. I applied for the national security studies, but I
                    said send me to Oxford, and I demonstrated how the State Department would
                    actually save money because tuition at Oxford was a pittance compared with
                    tuition at Harvard. It was unorthodox, and it was not covered by Department
                    regulations, but I made my case to Arnie Raphael, the principal deputy assistant
                    secretary in the Near East bureau (NEA), and Arnie made it happen. To the extent
                    that the Department could not cover something, NEA covered it so the mother
                    bureau did very well by me. Arnie Raphael did very well by me. So we went to
                    Oxford. We moved into a small row house near Port Meadows. I was attached to St.
                    Anthony's College which had a lot of Near East types, and I began a fascinating
                    nine months of basically reading about U.S. strategic thought and particularly
                    U.S. military engagements and then meeting with Sir Michael Howard for about an
                    hour and a half every two weeks to just talk about what I had read and what I
                    had written. I'm sure it was interesting why Howard took me on because it was
                    very unusual for an Oxford don to pick up someone of my background but I had
                    heard that Howard developed a personal relationship with Ron Spiers when Ron
                    Spiers was Deputy Chief of Mission in London. Ron Spiers was then in charge of
                    management at the State Department so I had prevailed on him to write a letter
                    to Howard to pick me up as a student, and Ambassador Spiers did that, and I
                    think that carried the day with Sir Michael.</p>
                <p>I also think he had a respect for practitioners which is unusual in academia and
                    that he found it a little bit interesting to have somebody who was a practicing
                    diplomat to talk to every once in a while in addition to the more academic
                    students that he would be dealing with. So I read his works: The European Way of
                    War, The Causes of War, tThe Franco-Prussian War and enjoyed it immensely. Then
                    I read a lot about World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam and really felt for
                    the first time I had a grounding in how the U.S. conducted its wars. It was a
                    very intellectually profitable period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you fit within the Oxford academic system and
                        students and the other dons and all and their approach? I mean, this is true
                        if you go to Harvard or Wisconsin or something. One talks an awfully lot
                        about theory and all and the other one says okay, fine. What do I do? Which
                        is the practitioner's way. Did you find that, were they realistic did you
                        feel in what you were getting?HULL: Well, Howard certainly had an
                        appreciation for the practitioners' dilemmas. I never felt a significant gap
                        there. It was hard to make connections across the board however. Oxford is a
                        very bookish place. The interesting intellectual debate going on actually
                        had nothing to do with the Middle East. It was directed at the Soviet Union.
                        St. Anthony's had a series of lectures on events in the Soviet Union, and
                        this was the period of early Gorbachev, and there were two camps in Oxford.
                        There was a camp of eastern European �migr�'s who took an extremely dubious
                        attitude toward Gorbachev and the prospects for reform in Russia in the
                        Soviet Union, and then there was another group, I think, it was headed by
                        Archie McLeish, a Scott, who were Western scholars of the Soviet Union. They
                        took a different attitude which was that something is happening here,
                        Gorbachev is for real. They went back and forth in weekly presentations on
                        various aspects of the problem. They were very stimulating because there was
                        very sharp questioning between the dons and with the graduate students,
                        which was totally absent from the undergraduate lectures. No undergraduate
                        opened his mouth for fear that either the professor or his peers would
                        consider him ignorant on any matter whatsoever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also I don't know if it prevails in the university
                        but the British system is replete with tales of being able to put somebody
                        down. You know, rather than saying, “Well, that's an interesting question”
                        and go on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Very true. I once asked Howard why he didn't take questions after his
                    lectures, and he said he had tried to do so but all of the accents were Yankee,
                    and so he had stopped the practice. In any case, St. Anthony's series of
                    graduate seminars on the Soviet Union reached a dramatic climax when one day the
                    leader of the Eastern European camp, Hungarian I believe, got up after a
                    presentation and announced that he had just obtained reliable data on the state
                    of the Soviet Union's economy, and he now concluded that Gorbachev had no choice
                    because of these economic factors. Reforms would have to take place, and it
                    would be a new day in Eastern Europe. The conversion of the most eminent of the
                    hard-line skeptics to the position of the perceivers of reform was a dramatic
                    intellectual moment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, these people were very serious scholars, and I believe they were
                    intellectually honest, although skeptical.</p>

                        time and where it was going at the time we are talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think that first he was very close to Thatcher and although he was not in
                    any way a simple minded conservative, he was to some extent a disciple of
                    Bernard Brodie. He had a realists', very much a realists' view of the Cold War,
                    and the Soviet nuclear capability and therefore he was not at all European in
                    the sense of active opposition to the deployment of theater nuclear
                    missiles.</p>

                        wasn't it going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, I believe so, although I wasn't focused on that. He was generally
                    strongly supportive of NATO, the UK's connection with the United States and the
                    need for a tough Western position vis-�-vis the Soviet Union, Soviet bloc and
                    the Cold War. At the same time, he felt that the Star Wars project was
                    misconceived, and he compared Reagan himself to Hindenburg, a likeable, elder
                    statesmen of great reputation, but no great competence. I think that was
                    revealing as to his attitude toward the Reagan administration's approach
                    certainly on such issues as Star Wars.</p>
                <p>He also made a wise comment on the U.S. relationship with Europe. He suggested
                    that the U.S. should not consider itself the CEO of the “West, Inc.” but rather
                    should see itself as the senior partner in a law firm and should use its
                    influence, but not try to dictate policy to the Europeans, which inevitably they
                    would reject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he view our involvement in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: He didn't harp in criticism, but he viewed it as misguided and ineffectual
                    and although he, and I think if you read his writings of the time, he lays out
                    the mistakes in the U.S. approach, but he wasn't strident. He wasn't one to
                    reduce the U.S. to that issue or let that issue overshadow the contribution the
                    United States had made in World War I and World War II in the post-World War II
                    world of Europe. He took a much more balanced position.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think she found it very challenging. She found the English academics a
                    little bit off-putting in that they were engaged with the subject academically
                    and intellectually, but without cultural affinity or understanding. So it was a
                    rather difficult period in that regard.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Bob Pelletreau had been named ambassador to Tunisia, and I was recruited to
                    be his political counselor at the embassy in Tunis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Achille Lauro. Would you explain what
                        the Achille Lauro was and the situation and then about what you saw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Achille Lauro was an Italian cruise boat that was cruising in the
                    Mediterranean in the early fall of 1985 and it was taken over by four terrorists
                    from the Palestinian Liberation Front. Among the passengers on this boat were
                    scores of American citizens so when the news of the hijacking took place, of
                    course, all the embassies in that area of the Mediterranean were put on alert.
                    We followed events very closely. Embassy Cairo where I was then serving as
                    deputy political counselor became particularly involved when the terrorists
                    finally decided to bring the boat into Egyptian waters which meant that the
                    Egyptian authorities would have control of the boat, the terrorists and the
                    hostages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then how did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, Nick Veliotes was ambassador in Cairo at the time. Nick had been
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs in
                    Washington and had been more or less rewarded for that very, very difficult job
                    by being named ambassador in Cairo. At that stage, Cairo was the largest embassy
                    in the world so it was quite a prestigious position. Nick Veliotes was of Greek
                    ancestry, an exuberant diplomat, and very, very shrewd. He knew Washington, and
                    he knew the Middle East. He was very outspoken in his approach, and therefore he
                    made a very striking contrast to Roy Atherton who had been the previous
                    ambassador. I felt it was very hard not to like him because with Nick Veliotes
                    you saw the man in full. I enjoyed working under him as I had enjoyed working
                    with Roy Atherton.</p>
                <p>We were in touch with Washington pretty much on a 24-hour basis because of the
                    crisis, and we were talking with the operations center and particularly with P
                    (the office of the undersecretary for political affairs), specifically with
                    Chris Ross who was then executive assistant for Undersecretary Mike
                    Armacost.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>As the boat headed toward Egyptian waters, we got an instruction from P, and they
                    were to be very candid with the Egyptians: what we expected of them and that
                    included not only going to the assistance of the hostages, but arresting the
                    terrorists and bringing them to justice either in Egypt or handing them over to
                    the United States. I remember getting this instruction from Chris Ross in the
                    wee hours of the morning going over to the residence and passing on the
                    instructions to Ambassador Veliotes, who promptly called the Minister of Defense
                    Abu Ghazala, the second most powerful man in Egypt at the time. Ambassador
                    Veliotes conveyed our position with very strong language, laying down an
                    unmistakable marker.</p>
                <p>We were then of course, tasked to go to the aid of the hostages.</p>

                <p>HULL: We knew it was coming in to Port Said. So Ambassador Veliotes asked me to
                    accompany him to Port Said. I had a few minutes to pull my thoughts together
                    which included such practical things as getting a list of the names of the
                    hostages as we knew them and then we drove up to Port Said. We had a very good
                    honorary consul there, Hassan Fathy, an Egyptian whom I had worked with before.
                    He did a very good job of linking us up with the governor and then the security
                    authorities, who quickly arranged to transport us to the boat. So we actually
                    met the boat at sea in Egyptian waters before it was able to come into Port
                    Said. I remember it was during the night and the seas were relatively high
                    making the transfer from the small boat to the big passenger liner somewhat
                    difficult. Finally we got onboard, and we found a traumatized crew and
                    passengers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Egyptian military, were somebody on board? You
                        weren't just boarding it with the hijackers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The hijackers had already been removed from the boat so we were going on
                    and we had Egyptian authorities on board, but the crew was basically back in
                    charge of the vessel at this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The first thing we did was to verify the well-being of the American citizens
                    onboard. It was early morning and the passengers were asleep in their cabins. I
                    had my list of American passengers, so I systematically went around knocking on
                    cabin doors and checking off any Americans from that list. I found all but one
                    passenger. Meanwhile, Ambassador Veliotes had engaged with the crew, who didn't
                    have a lot of English but who were by gesturing and pantomime explaining to us
                    that something had happened. That something was that Leon Klinghoffer, an old
                    and infirmed American had been killed by the terrorists. He was in a wheelchair
                    at the time and his body had been dumped over the side. The crew took me to the
                    location., and you could still see on the side of the vessel bloodstains from
                    where Mr. Klinghoffer's body had struck the side in going overboard. His wife
                    was there. She and the other passengers confirmed the account of the crew, and
                    we knew that we had a very difficult situation because not only did we have the
                    problem of taking care of the hostages, but now the Egyptians were really on the
                    spot because the hijacker who had been taken into custody were now clearly
                    guilty of murdering an American.</p>
                <p>On the way back to Port Said, my primary mission was to try to take care of the
                    hostages as best I could and that meant trying to give them assurances that now
                    they had U.S. government representatives there to help them, that their needs
                    would be taken care of, that Klinghoffer's murder would be pursued. Of course,
                    they were highly emotional and also recovering from the period in which they
                    were held helpless in mortal terror. One thing that I decided would be good to
                    do to fill the time would be to have all of them sit down with pen and paper and
                    to write out an account of their experiences. That would give something written
                    for the Egyptian investigators. It would also give the passengers something to
                    do as we were steaming toward Port Said.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Ambassador Veliotes was in touch with the captain, and as we came into
                    Port Said, the Ambassador spoke over the ship-to-shore phone with Egyptian
                    officials. I believe it was with Defense Minister Abu Ghazala. In no uncertain
                    language, he reminded him that Egypt was responsible for bringing these
                    terrorists to justice and used expletives in so doing. Ambassador Veliotes had
                    no idea that this call was being monitored by the media, but it was. It was on
                    an unclassified system and so his salty language was carried in the media and
                    caused great consternation in Egypt and probably elsewhere in the Arab world.
                    But Ambassador Veliotes had given fair warning and was now accurately predicting
                    the action that would happen in Washington with confirmation of an American
                    citizen's death.</p>
                <p>When we finally got in Port Said, Ambassador Veliotes made his way back to Cairo
                    to manage the crisis which now was in full swing in Egyptian-U.S. relations. I
                    was asked to stay with the hostages, and at this stage we were joined by the
                    regional psychologist from the embassy. We were bussed to a military airbase
                    outside of Cairo and boarded a C-130 to be flown to Germany for medical
                    examinations. I accompanied the hostages.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>In midair, we had news that American military aircraft had intercepted the
                    Egyptian airplane that was taking the terrorists from Egypt to Tunisia, which at
                    the time was the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
                    President Reagan had made the decision that we would so intervene and force the
                    Egyptian airplane down at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Sigonella, Sicily. This
                    interception caused even greater consternation back in Cairo.</p>
                <p>We were diverted from Germany to Sigonella to give some of the hostages the
                    opportunity to identify the terrorists and that process took place at the
                    military. While this process was being done, many of us were outside in a
                    waiting area. We were joined there by the team from the Special Operations
                    Command (Socom) which had been shadowing the Achille Lauro at sea. So, we had an
                    interesting situation in which the hostages, the terrorists, the U.S. special
                    operations personnel and U.S. diplomats were co located and to some extent,
                    could discuss the incident. At that time, I learned that special ops team had
                    been prepared to storm the vessel. The hostages on hearing of this plan to storm
                    the vessel expressed relief that it had not occurred. The hostages had been
                    separated into different groups. The hijackers were with those dispersed groups,
                    had automatic weapons and had radio contact. At least some of the hostages
                    believed that if the storming had occurred, the hijackers would have opened up
                    with automatic weapons, and there would have been many casualties.</p>
                <p>The next move came from the Italians. Balancing their diplomatic interests as
                    they saw them and knowing that this was a highly sensitive subject in the Arab
                    world, the Italians decided to move the hijackers to Rome out of American
                    custody. General Steiner who was commanding the special operations forces
                    insisted on accompanying the hijackers. When the Italians refused, he ordered
                    his small jet to take off from the base without clearance and he flew over, just
                    over, the heads of the Italian authorities and directed his airplane to Rome.
                    His concern was well founded because eventually the Italians did release Abu
                    Abbas, who was not among the hijackers of the Achille Lauro but who had come to
                    Italy to meet with his men who had been hijackers and who was responsible with
                    commanding the operation. So this caused a great stress to U.S.-Italian
                    relations as well.</p>
                <p>After I had handed the American citizens over to doctors and psychologists at
                    Sigonella, I was pleased to return to Cairo and did so to find that a diplomatic
                    firestorm was taking place. The Egyptians were outraged, especially by the
                    interception of the Egypt Air flight. The Egyptians believed that they had done
                    a service to the U.S. by arranging for the hijacking to end without further loss
                    of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had they known at the time that Klinghoffer had been
                        killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>HULL: It was not clear that they knew at the time. We, the American Embassy, did
                    not know at the time. There were media reports that a hostage had been killed
                    but those were unconfirmed reports. In his conversations with the Defense
                    Minister, Ambassador Veliotes clearly laid down a marker that we wanted the
                    terrorists held responsible and specifically mentioned that if any Americans had
                    been killed or harmed that would be a very serious affair. Then from the boat,
                    of course, we confirmed to the Egyptians that Klinghoffer had been killed and
                    therefore in taking their action of transporting or trying to transport the
                    hijacker to Tunis the Egyptian government was acting with knowledge an American
                    had died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get the chronology link, Veliotes had informed the
                        Egyptian authorities Klinghoffer had been killed before the Egyptians had
                        allowed the Egypt airplane to take off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I'm not sure that it was before they allowed the Egypt airplane to take
                    off, but in any case the terrorists were still in Egyptian custody while in
                    flight. So they had the possibility of either keeping them in Cairo or turning
                    the plane around.</p>
                <p>So, there was a diplomatic firestorm in Cairo, and the Egyptians needed a
                    scapegoat. They could not or would not make President Reagan or Secretary Shultz
                    the scapegoat and so Ambassador Veliotes became the scapegoat. Ambassador
                    Veliotes was particularly castigated for the language he had used when the
                    Achille Lauro was approaching Port Said. It had been salty language. Ambassador
                    Veliotes took this scapegoating with great professionalism, even stoicism. I
                    never heard him complain, I never heard him fault Washington but at the end of
                    the day it was the ambassador who was forced to leave Cairo prematurely and pay
                    the price of the diplomatic crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like this with the embassy and all this is not
                        one of these things where you could say, “Well, you know, it's one of those
                        little tiffs” or something. It must've affected you all, to be mad as hell
                        at the Egyptians for doing that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think there was a very strong feeling on the part of Americans in Cairo,
                    certainly those of us involved directly with the hostages. But we had in
                    Ambassador Veliotes an example of how we were to conduct ourselves and that was
                    to be professionals and to carry on with our mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you judge the reaction in Egypt? Did they see the
                        enormity of what the hijackers had done? Or did it fall into Arab support of
                        Arabs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, of course, you have to remember that at this time there were lots of
                    acts of terrorism going on in the Middle East and this was not the only one. It
                    was the only hijacking of a vessel at sea. The Arabs viewed these incidents
                    against the background of the Palestinian issue and attempts by the Palestinians
                    to draw world attention to their cause and therefore there was a great sympathy
                    in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.</p>
                <p>One footnote I would like to add here. I didn't really understand how closely
                    Washington was following the whole business until later when I received a letter
                    from Secretary of State Shultz. This was in early December. Secretary Shultz had
                    read reports of the operation and of our efforts on behalf of the hostages and
                    had taken the time and trouble to send a letter to me. It's one I'm very proud
                    of.</p>
                <p>“December 4, 1985</p>
                <p>Dear Mr. Hull,</p>
                <p>I was pleased to read the accounts written by (embassy doctors) concerning the
                    activities of the embassy team that responded to the victims of the Achille
                    Lauro hijacking. Both of the doctors commented on the excellence of your
                    performance in alleviating the distress of the hostages and expediting their
                    departure from the ship. Quotations from these reports best portray your
                    efforts:</p>
                <p>“He expertly reinforced the image the ambassador presented by being open,
                    communicative, stable and caring. He was superb as he worked quietly and
                    diligently in taking care of everything from the mundane to the diplomatic.”</p>
                <p>Your performance meets the highest goals and traditions of the Foreign Service. I
                    commend you for your work in this tragic situation.</p>
                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
                <p>George P. Schultz”</p>
                <p>I think this was indicative of Secretary Shultz and the attention and care that
                    he took with the Foreign Service in appreciating our efforts and in going out of
                    his way to recognize those efforts.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that I have been doing these interviews for
                        20 years now and all secretaries of state are involved. I mean going back to
                        the '30s and George Schulz seems to stand out as being the one who is
                        respected as being both you might say administrative skills in dealing with
                        the Foreign Service and his diplomatic skills and carrying on a
                        foreign-policy under difficult circumstances. It was not the easiest group
                        to deal with in the administration or the situation abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, I would agree. I think one of his lasting legacies is the
                    strengthening of the Foreign Service and the creation of the National Foreign
                    Affairs Training Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where we are now. Named after him and rightly so. It
                        wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let's move on to 1987. You're off now to Tunisia.</p>
                <p>HULL: Right. Tunisia at this stage was a very interesting posting for three
                    reasons. One, President Bourguiba, the founding father of the Tunisian Republic,
                    is in his late 80s and faltering and therefore his succession is in the offing.
                    Secondly, the Arab League had moved from Cairo to Tunisia as a result of
                    President Sadat's peace agreement with Israel and therefore Arab politics were
                    very active in Tunis. Number three, the PLO had also moved its headquarters to
                    Tunis after it had been forced out of Lebanon by the Israeli invasion in 1982.
                    So what had been a diplomatic backwater at many times, at this particular moment
                    was a focus of a great deal of American diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I was political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the ambassador. Who was it and what was
                        his background? How did he sort of use the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Ambassador Robert Pelletreau was one of our most outstanding diplomats. He
                    had previously been ambassador in the Gulf. He had previously been a deputy
                    assistant secretary in State and in Defense. He was an extremely thoughtful man,
                    a New Englander who chose his words carefully and spoke precisely. He was a man
                    of great integrity and honesty. He was trusted by Washington, and he was a
                    delight to work with because he was also very personable, treated his staff with
                    respect and gave them scope to develop their talents and use their talents. I
                    could not have asked for a better boss.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you hit the ground there what was preoccupying
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Tunisia was in a very strange situation. Bourguiba was still functioning as
                    president and yet he was doing so erratically. I had a chance to see this
                    firsthand because when Ambassador Pelletreau presented his credentials he took
                    with him a small group from the embassy which included myself and so we had a
                    chance to meet President Bourguiba and to see his state. Now I had been in
                    Tunisia from 1971 to 1973 in the Peace Corps so I had known Bourguiba of the
                    early '70's when he was one of the leading statesmen in the Arab world. He was
                    very farsighted and his vision for Tunisia was still producing benefits. The man
                    I saw in 1987 was a shadow of his former self. He could barely carry on a
                    conversation. He was very shaky on his feet and it soon became clear that his
                    mental faculties were fading fast because he would dismiss a cabinet one week,
                    make new appointments and then the following week he forgot who he had appointed
                    to the various ministries. So it was clearly just a matter of time but it was
                    not clear at all how the succession would occur and what damage might occur to
                    Tunisia if President Bourguiba continued to exercise his powers in senility. The
                    minister of interior was a young man named Ben Ali and he was respected. He was
                    a very efficient interior minister. It was therefore of interest to us when he
                    suddenly became promoted to prime minister and began to organize a new
                    government. As I said, these shifts were occurring weekly in some instances. I'm
                    sure that Ben Ali knew that the tenure of prime minister was tenuous.</p>
                <p>I got a phone call one evening from Ambassador Pelletreau who asked me to come
                    over to the residence. When I got there Ambassador Pelletreau said he wanted to
                    talk to me about a meeting he had had. He had been called in to see Prime
                    Minister Ben Ali, and Ben Ali had spoken to him about President Bourguiba's
                    condition and also in general terms about the stability of the country.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Pelletreau was trying to decide what to make of this conversation. It
                    was clear that he and Ben Ali had agreed that President Bourguiba was no longer
                    functioning adequately. A few days after that we were both given the news that
                    President Bourguiba had been declared incapable of governing and pursuant to the
                    clause of the Constitution he had been moved out and Ben Ali had assumed the
                    presidency. In this, Ben Ali had the support of Hedi Baccouche, a leading
                    politician of the ruling party, as opposed to Ben Ali, who was more of a career
                    official. The Tunisian Army fairly quickly fell in line with Ben Ali. We looked
                    at the technicalities of it. We, of course, knew the conditions Ben Ali had come
                    through. We knew that Ben Ali had the strong support of the security services
                    and the political party. So our judgment to Washington was that the succession
                    was not in effect a coup. It had been done according to the Constitutional
                    requirements, and Ben Ali was in power and likely to stay in power. Our
                    recommendation was that the U.S. government should recognize the new government
                    as legitimate.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>We had been told, I had been told in training, and Ambassador Pelletreau knew
                    from experience that in these situations what was most important to Washington
                    is clear-eyed analysis of the situation and then a very clear recommendation on
                    what U.S. policy should be. I believe we provided that focus to Washington, and
                    Washington followed our advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a strong opposition hovering over the horizon at
                        that time? Were we looking at say, a radical Islamic thing or something
                        going on of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Political Islam was a significant concern. In Algeria, the storm clouds
                    were gathering. It would take another year for that to explode, but we knew
                    political Islamists in Tunisia had a very strong party and were a factor in
                    North African politics.</p>
                <p>We were also concerned frankly with Libya because at that stage Qaddafi was still
                    very rambunctious, doing irresponsible things. Only a few years earlier, he had
                    actually intervened in Tunisia militarily, and we wanted to head off any
                    adventurism on the part of Libya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the intervention like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was an intervention in the south across the border that divides Tunisia
                    from Libya and a small military altercation between the two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. In those days of course, Libya was a bete noire for Washington. We
                    very strongly supported Tunisia. We increased our military assistance to
                    Tunisia, and we wanted to lay down a clear marker that Tunisia had very strong
                    friends if the Libyans wanted to repeat their adventure. Also the offshore oil
                    fields that the Libyans and Tunisians contested were subsequently determined to
                    be Tunisian by the World Court. So we kept an eye on that situation as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this we had helped check Libya so what, did you at that
                        time see a real contest of power inside Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>HULL: Our judgment was that Ben Ali would hold power because he had the support
                    of the military, the security services and the party. The question was what kind
                    of power it would be and initially Ben Ali and Baccouche adopted a very liberal
                    position, including a declaration that, I think, Thomas Jefferson would have
                    been proud of. There was a hope that under Ben Ali, Tunisia would see a
                    flourishing of democracy. In Bourguiba's old age, he had become more tyrannical
                    and had lashed out at all opposition groups so Ben Ali arrived with the promise
                    of a lighter hand. Unfortunately, as time passed those early promises were not
                    respected, and Ben Ali's strong security bent became dominant and so since '87
                    we have seen a progressive hardening of the rule in Tunisia and the golden
                    opportunity for an Arab democracy was missed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where stood you know, some of the groups, I'm thinking of
                        students, the general population. How did they stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think the general population understood that President Bourguiba's time
                    had passed. There was a joke at the time, I recall. An old man would go down
                    each day to the newsstand and look at the front page. He would never buy a
                    paper, just look at the front page and then he would go home. After he did this
                    on several occasions, the agent at the newsstand said, “Well, why don't you buy
                    a paper?” And the old man said, “Well, you see I'm only interested in the
                    obituaries.” And the news agent said, “Well, that's all the more reason to buy
                    the paper because the obituaries are on inside pages.” And the old man said,
                    “Not the obituary that I need to see.”</p>
                <p>Ironically, relieved of the presidency, President Bourguiba returned to his
                    hometown of Monastir and lived many more years. He proved to have a very robust
                    constitution and was treated with respect throughout his very long life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this constitutional move, how stood the situation in
                        Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The situation was fairly stable and under the economy minister, who was a
                    former World Bank official, the Tunisians had initiated a series of economic
                    reforms in 1986. Those reforms grew out of an economic crisis that proved, in
                    retrospect, an opportunity and the minister of economy helped the government
                    take full advantage of it. The reforms that he enacted put the Tunisian economy
                    on a successful track which it has maintained since 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way they were blessed by not having
                        overwhelming oil. This is often a curse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Exactly. On either side of them in Algeria and in Libya, oil or gas-rich
                    economies that did not develop in a healthy way. So you're right.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The PLO has relocated to Tunisia. We all remember Black
                        September in 1970 in Jordan. I mean the PLO was certainly a nasty tenant in
                        Lebanon. Had they learned their lesson? How did they stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was a different situation. The PLO in Tunisia was not the PLO with
                    armed military might. After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the PLO forces had
                    been dispersed around the Arab world. Some had gone to Sudan, some had gone to
                    Yemen. What had come to Tunisia was the PLO leadership, the politicians. Abu
                    Ammar (Yasser Arafat), Abu Jihad (Khalil al-Wazir), Abu Iyad (Salah Khalaf)
                    those were the ones that were in Tunisia. At that stage, there was a strict
                    prohibition against U.S. contacts with the PLO except the very limited,
                    carefully controlled security contract which had occurred mostly in Beirut. So
                    we were in a situation of being in the same space, but not talking to each
                    other. Often we would be at events where we might turn to our neighbor, ask a
                    few polite questions and learned that it was a PLO official at which stage you
                    had to pretty much terminate the conversation and not be perceived as engaging.
                    The PLO presence did attract attention and sometimes violent attention. The
                    Israelis on one occasion conducted an air strike on PLO headquarters which was
                    just outside Tunis killing many Tunisians which, of course, then strained the
                    U.S.-Tunisian relation. On another occasion, Israeli commandos landed on the
                    beaches and then proceeded to use the house of Abu Jihad and assassinated him.
                    Abu Jihad was perhaps the most popular leader in the Palestinian national
                    movement, more popular than Arafat, The Israelis targeted him almost certainly
                    because they were confronted in the Occupied Territories with the Intifada (the
                    uprising). Although the Intifada was really homegrown, the PLO had to respond to
                    it and Abu Jihad had responsibility for the occupied territories, and therefore
                    the Israelis were sending a message in assassinated him. In a way, it was a
                    futile gesture. It had no practical impact on the Intifada, which was an
                    indigenous phenomenon. However, it did deny the PLO one of their best
                    leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're using the term “Occupied Territories”, could
                        you explain if that had a specific meaning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We're talking about the West Bank of Jordan and Gaza Strip which were
                    occupied by Israel in 196i.e. the former being the consular district of
                    Jerusalem where I had worked from 1975-79. So, there was a great deal of tension
                    on and off, and we were following things as closely as we could but at arm's
                    length. In 1986 in the fall, Arafat convened the Palestinian National Council
                    (PNC) in Algiers next door, and I was asked to go over from Tunis to help
                    Algiers in reporting on the meeting. At that time, we had Chris Ross in Algiers
                    I believe, as charge. Chris was one of the most outstanding Arabists of his
                    generation, and a very canny diplomat. I enjoyed working with Chris.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>We covered the council meeting. Of course, we did not go directly but we had
                    developed in Tunis very good relations with American media and when they came
                    into interview Arafat, they stopped by the embassy and got our take and we are
                    would get their take. Therefore, we had some pretty good accounts and
                    assessments of the chairman and the PLO. Then those same correspondents covering
                    the PNC would help us out in understanding what was going on.</p>
                <p>It turned out that this was an historic meeting. In the meeting, Yasser Arafat
                    declared the foundation of the Palestinian state but in so doing recognized
                    Israel as a state and this was a significant departure from the Palestinian
                    covenant. It was not enough, however, for Washington to initiate a dialogue. We
                    had our conditions that Assistant Secretary Dick Murphy had endlessly repeated
                    around the Middle East which included recognizing Israel but also renouncing
                    violence and terrorism and accepting Resolution 242. There followed a couple of
                    months of diplomatic back and forth indirectly between the PLO and Washington,
                    including a very memorable visit to New York by Arafat for the General Assembly
                    in which he addressed the assembly with a handgun strapped to his waist.
                    Finally, Arafat made a statement , I believe it was in Geneva at a UN special
                    session on Palestine which had been transferred from New York to Geneva because
                    of visa issues. There Arafat had conceded to the U.S. formula. The Reagan
                    administration acknowledged the change in PLO policy and announced there would
                    be an official dialogue and that that dialogue would take place with the one and
                    only channel that would be the U.S. Embassy in Tunis led by Ambassador
                    Pelletreau. So we found ourselves designated as the official channel for the PLO
                    and this reflected, I think, Washington's esteem and trust in Ambassador
                    Pelletreau as someone who could manage such a sensitive contact well.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>So we had then a series of high-profile, formalized meetings between the U.S.
                    Government represented by the U.S. Embassy and the PLO. And in addition to those
                    formal meetings, we had the ability to talk with other members of the PLO
                    informally. Washington was very careful in giving us much leeway in that regard.
                    The formal meetings unfortunately, became very much set pieces. This was 1988,
                    and it was in the last days of the administration, the Reagan administration. We
                    had followed through on our commitment to dialogue with the PLO, but there was
                    no interest in Washington to put substance into that dialogue. Subsequently,
                    when the Bush Administration succeeded the Reagan Administration the status
                    continued. So we in Tunis were frustrated. We were trying to make something of
                    this, and yet we found ourselves being hogtied by Washington. We would get
                    questions from the PLO. To answer them, we would take the substance from our
                    longstanding positions and try to repackage it in a way that met the PLO's
                    expectations. Washington would not even look at the repackaging of the material.
                    It was as if we were dealing with a script. Nor did it matter if the PLO changed
                    its positions. I remember on one occasion that our interlocutors for the first
                    time accepted the idea of an “interim arrangement” for the occupied territories.
                    This was an element in the Camp David Accords which the PLO had always rejected.
                    I knew because I had been political counselor in Jerusalem at the time and
                    charged with convincing the Palestinians that this step was a necessary one. We
                    highlighted the development for Washington, but got no significant recognition
                    of it much less reciprocal flexibility on the U.S. side. So the formal meetings
                    led nowhere.</p>
                <p>Our informal meetings were a bit more productive. We saw Hakim Balaoui, the PLO
                    ambassador to Tunis, regularly and then Ambassador Pelletreau got permission to
                    enlarge the effort so we were able to either meet with Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
                    Mazen), who eventually succeeded Arafat as President of the Palestinian
                    Authority, and even Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad), who was especially controversial
                    because of his leadership of the Black September Organization. I joined the
                    meetings with Abu Mazen. I remember the first one was over at Balaoui's
                    residence, which was just a block from mine, and he had an enormous spread of
                    Palestinian food, almost everything you could imagine. But he made the mistake
                    of asking me whether there was anything not included and in excess of honesty
                    noted there was no “aqoub.”.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is what?</hi>

                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>HULL: “Aqoub” is a kind of thistle that grows in Palestine and is unknown
                    elsewhere in the Middle East. Humble, yet appreciated by connoisseurs. Since I
                    spent four years in Jerusalem and I was married to a Palestinian, I was
                    intimately familiar with the Palestinian cookbook. About 10 days after this,
                    someone showed up at my gate with two packages up “aqoub.”. The Palestinian
                    ambassador had somehow found a way to fulfill my desire. I thought it indicative
                    of how much the Palestinians wanted the dialogue to be productive. After that
                    dinner, we had occasion to meet repeatedly with Abu Mazen, and we were very much
                    impressed by his demeanor, by his language, and by the substance of his what he
                    said. He was a man of who originated in the town of Safed, which had become part
                    of Israel. He was knowledgeable about events in Palestine, knowledgeable about
                    Israeli politics, and very much a proponent of a peaceful solution. I think our
                    initial readings of him has been borne out in all of his activities up to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Pelletreau also stuck his neck out and got Washington's permission to
                    meet with Abu Iyad as I noted above. As the head of Black September, he had
                    quite a bit of blood on his hands. Nevertheless, after Abu Jihad had been
                    assassinated, Abu Iyad ranked second in the PLO, and Ambassador Pelletreau
                    engaged with him. In fact, Abu Iyad atoned somewhat for his past by being
                    helpful to the U.S. in Beirut in protecting Americans in very tenuous situations
                    during the Lebanese civil war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to Bob Dillon and others who talked about the
                        PLO.. (was contact with Abu Iyad primarily for security?)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Our concern was not so much security although there were concerns that we
                    involved might become targets for assassinations. Intelligence reports indicated
                    that those involved in the U.S.-PLO dialogue was being targeted by extremist
                    Palestinians who rejected this approach. However, our primary concern was to
                    broaden the support within the PLO for a peaceful approach so that people who
                    were talking to us would not be isolated and weakened politically. Ambassador
                    Pelletreau realized that if Abu Iyad was also involved in the dialogue in some
                    way his involvement would reduce the pressure on people like Abu Mazen.</p>
                <p>When the contact with Abu Iyad leaked, there was a firestorm of criticism.
                    Ambassador Pelletreau went back to Washington and was called in to see Secretary
                    Baker who had only recently taken over as secretary of state and who generally
                    took a dim view of professional diplomats who complicated his political
                    situation. According to Ambassador Pelletreau, he was asked to explain who did
                    so and noted that the meeting had been approved by Washington in advance.
                    Margaret Tutwiler, one of the few people who could talk frankly with Jim Baker,
                    supported Ambassador Pelletreau's on this point and, in effect, said, “Mr.
                    Secretary, you did approve this meeting.” I think Ambassador Pelletreau was
                    always grateful to Margaret Tutwiler for speaking up.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>And so Ambassador Pelletreau came back to Tunis and unlike Ambassador Veliotes
                    from Cairo did not serve as a scapegoat, but rather continued on with the
                    dialogue, his career continued with many more significant responsibilities—e.g.
                    ambassador in Cairo, where I was his DCM, and eventually assistant secretary of
                    state for the Near East. Unfortunately, Washington never got around to putting
                    substance into the dialogue and therefore encounters became more and more
                    ritualistic. Finally, a splinter group of the PLO engaged in a operation in
                    Israel, and we called upon the PLO to condemn that operation “or else.” They did
                    not condemn it in so many words, and the dialogue was suspended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our evaluation of Yasser Arafat at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We saw Arafat repeatedly and on occasion with a visiting congressman.
                    Arafat was a mix. His personal habits were somewhat eccentric. He would not meet
                    until the late hours of the night or the wee hours of the morning. You would
                    never know exactly where and when you would meet. He had several locations in
                    Tunis. You'd get a call announcing a meeting in a very short time at a different
                    place. He was almost invariably gracious and would make an effort to extend
                    hospitality. I remember he insisted on preparing my cup of tea, handing out
                    honey for sweetener, He would speak at some length. His Arabic was quite good.
                    His English was fractured, however, and at times I thought he did himself a
                    disservice by trying to convey very complicated positions in elementary English.
                    It would have been better to use good interpreters for this material. He was a
                    bundle of energy, and he would be having meetings throughout Tunis and then fly
                    off and do circuits of the Arab world or go to Europe. He was in perpetual
                    motion. He was viewed affectionately within the PLO. He was not feared. He was
                    not like Saddam Hussein, for example. His colleagues would disagree with him in
                    meetings and so it was not a dictatorial arrangement. He eventually took a wife
                    who was the daughter of one of my close contacts in my Jerusalem days. It was
                    rather ironic that the chairman who was called “al khitiar” (the old man), in
                    his declining years picked a young Christian girl as his wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any of the feeling that later became so
                        apparent that Arafat was someone you couldn't make a deal with? You know,
                        when presidents tried to bring off things. When you got him up to the brink
                        of really making a decision that might have even brought peace there, he
                        couldn't make it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HULL: This is the conventional wisdom. I do not think it is valid. I think Yasser
                    Arafat could make a deal, and this gets us into a very complicated subject that
                    is what happened with Oslo and the failure at Clinton's Camp David Summit. But
                    in a nutshell, my impression is on the Oslo Accords neither side performed as it
                    had promised. The United States did not hold them accountable. Arafat's
                    political position was weakened by nonperformance on the part of Israeli Prime
                    Minister Netanyahu. Then he was ignored initially by Prime Minister Barak, who
                    preferred an agreement with Syrian President Assad. Only after we allowed the
                    Syrian track to become a dead end, did President Clinton and Prime Minister
                    Barak belatedly turn to Arafat to address the Palestinian part of the equation.
                    They persuaded him to come to Camp David on the understanding. that there would
                    be no forcing of a deal. Arafat actually had said he was not prepared to make a
                    deal, not politically prepared, I believe, given the fact that any concessions
                    on Jerusalem and refugees would be extremely controversial among Palestinians. I
                    think that history, when it's finally written and understood, will show a much
                    more complex picture than Arafat not stepping up to the plate at a critical
                    moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the period just before the end of the
                        Clinton administration in 2000. Back to when you were there, did you feel
                        sort of the hand of both the Israelis and the Israeli lobby breathing down
                        your neck the whole time you were there? I mean, was this sort of just in
                        the air?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, of course the Israelis had carried out both the airstrike against the
                    PLO headquarters and the assassination of Abu Jihad in Tunis so they made their
                    power felt directly. I didn't personally feel direct pressure from the Israeli
                    lobby until I was working for the National Security Council in Washington. But
                    the hamstringing of the U.S.-PLO dialogue reflected, I believe, a political
                    calculus in Washington that gave great weight to the lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about when you were reporting did you say,
                        okay. If we're making a cable concerning these things we know that it will
                        probably be on the desk of a proponent of Israel in Congress before probably
                        the secretary knows. I mean was that part of the ambience or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We didn't believe that would be the case. We did our reporting in very
                    restricted channels, “nodis”, “exdis” and to my knowledge there was never a
                    leak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about internal politics? In the first place, you were
                        in Tunisia from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: From 1987 to 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on internally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HULL: Economic development coupled with gradual political suppression. After a
                    brief period of political liberalization with the passing of Bourguiba,
                    President Ben Ali began to curtail the opposition and particularly the Islamic
                    opposition in the form of the “An Nahda” (Renaissance) party. In 1988, the civil
                    war in Algeria arose because the Algerian military intervened after the first
                    days of the election in which the Islamic Front had taken a lead. Therefore, you
                    had this violent clash going on next door in Algeria and the reaction in Tunisia
                    was a tightening of security and a retrenchment of liberalization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that sort of move rather quietly into Ben Ali camp or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It moved fairly quickly into the Ben Ali camp, and I think Ben Ali
                    engineered the crack down, which was natural to a former minister of interior.
                    My impression was that Hedi Baccouche, being a politician, was sincere in the
                    early declarations of political liberalization. His passing from the government
                    and consolidation of power in Ben Ali's hands moved Tunisia away from the goal
                    democratization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Algeria you had these religious fundamentalists. Were
                        they trying to stir things up in Tunisia? You think certainly of Tunisia at
                        that time as being rather free from religious orthodoxy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Tunisia was probably the most moderate Arab country and Bourguiba had
                    instituted reforms concerning women, for example. The Algerian Islamists were
                    not fishing in troubled waters in Tunisia to any great extent. They had their
                    hands full with the Algerian military. In Tunisia, you had an indigenous Islamic
                    party, “An Nahda”, which in Arabic means Renaissance. It was led by Rachid
                    Ghannouchi, who was in exile. It was on paper a very moderate Islamic party, and
                    we knew of no activities that belied that position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Qaddafi have a following in Tunisia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Not a significant following. He was behaving quite erratically. He had run
                    down the Libyan economy, and he had intervened militarily in Tunisia. He was not
                    a popular person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the French? Did the French have any significant
                        ties there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. French language and culture at least in the capital was so strong that
                    it was a challenge to get Tunisians to speak to you in Arabic. Both Ambassador
                    Pelletreau and I spoke Arabic, French and English, and we would be delighted
                    when we would find some politicians, and I found some in the opposition, who
                    were more comfortable in Arabic than in French. The mainstream politicians would
                    divert to French very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was told that Dick Parker who met blank one time
                        chastised his cabinet you know, the American ambassador speaks better Arabic
                        than you do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: And with good reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French have any particular interests, you know,
                        other than cultural interests and much influence there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They had lots of influence. They had a grand embassy on Avenue Bourguiba.
                    They were there in force. They had assistance programs. Also, the Tunisians
                    often got medical treatment in Paris so they had very considerable influence.
                    That seemed to be an end in itseli.e. maintaining this special relationship
                    between France and Tunisia that really didn't serve any particular French
                    interest to any great extent. Nevertheless, it was important to both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the major naval base? Was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At this point Bizerte was not a significant strategic factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any overlay or involvement in Tunisia during

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, of course, one of the decisive battles of World War II, the Battle of
                    Kasserine Pass.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: But eventually we did succeed. We used North Africa as a staging ground for
                    our campaign in Italy. There is in Carthage, one of the northern suburbs of
                    Tunisia, a beautiful American military cemetery. It's been maintained impeccably
                    and annually on Veterans Day we would have a ceremony there. I think nowhere in
                    the world have America's fallen been better remembered than in that
                    cemetery.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Egypt was represented by Ali Maher, a very intelligent fellow and this
                    reflected Tunisia's importance as the site of the Arab League. The Arab League
                    was an Egyptian invention, and there was great umbrage in Egypt when it was
                    moved from Cairo to Tunis after Sadat made peace with Israel. The Egyptians
                    never really accepted that move. It was always their intent to get it back to
                    Cairo, which eventually they did. Meanwhile, they were well represented at the
                    Arab League.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think they would have been sort of natural ties
                        between Tunisia and Morocco. Did Morocco play any role or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At the time there was a regional organization. I think it was called the
                    AMU, the Arab Maghreb Union, which comprised Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and
                    Libya. It was an attempt by the North Africans to come up with their own club.
                    Other clubs were forming in the Middle East, and they wanted theirs. There were
                    some meetings, but not a lot of significance or interaction. As we pursued peace
                    in the Middle East, both Rabat and Tunis were stops for the secretary of state
                    as he would try to build support for peace. Of course, King Hassan of Morocco
                    was always helpful in that regard. He headed the Jerusalem committee of the Arab
                    League, and he had a great deal of prestige and influence.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Not to speak of. There were historic synagogues in the island of Djerba, but the
                    community had left for Europe or Israel.</p>

                        director for Northern Gulf Affairi.e. Iraq and Iran. Within a week of your
                        arrival, Saddam Hussein in August invades Kuwait and you're the new boy on
                        the block and you have probably located Kuwait on the map by this time. But
                        anyway, what was your initial impression and that of the people around you?
                        Were we going to do something, did we have to do something or did you have
                        any feel on how this mess is going to sort itself out?</hi>

                    further Iraqi advances through Saudi Arabia. What we were going to do vis-�-vis
                    Iraq..</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: That's right. The war ends, there are openings in the National Security
                    Council and Richard Haass who is the senior director for the Near East and South
                    Asia is recruiting people to fill those openings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left the State Department how stood things say
                        with Iran? I mean, I mean in a way this could have been kind of an opening
                        for Iran. We gave their mortal enemy a body blow. Were we getting anything,
                        any opportunities with those openings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We have to back up a little bit. When the Reagan administration came in and
                    replaced the Carter administration there was a almost a knee-jerk rejection of
                    what the Carter administration people like Warren Christopher and Al Saunders
                    had negotiated with the Iranians and it took a great deal of effort to convince
                    the new administration to accept that basis which stabilized the bilateral
                    relationship. For eight years you had an arm's-length relationship. With Bush
                    41, Bush the father, there was a recognition because of Iraq that we had to
                    manage Iran and we didn't want our activities vis-�-vis Iraq misinterpreted by
                    Iran. We didn't want to end up in a two-front war in the Gulf. And so that was
                    the real thrust of what diplomacy during the first Gulf Wai.e. to make sure the
                    Iranians knew what we were doing and what our objectives were against Saddam and
                    his regime and that we did not intend nor did we want to fight with Iran. It did
                    not go further than that. The wounds from the hostage crisis were still
                    relatively fresh. The Iranian regime was not really making overtures towards us.
                    There was still a lot of hostility on their part. We had our hands full
                    otherwise and therefore, we didn't have a larger ambition to use the first Gulf
                    War as an opportunity for rapport with Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get any, sort of at your level ,was there anybody
                        looking at what's in this for Iran that leaves the power structure
                        continuing because you know, with some nice words something could probably
                        have happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, I'm not sure that's true because much of that depended upon
                    Tehran.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about on their side.HULL: On their side we did
                        not sense any new page being turned. They were still dealing with the
                        Khomeini revolution, and they still had a vocation for exporting their
                        revolution elsewhere in the region so that, at least at my level, I did not
                        detect any great opening vis-�-vis Iran. I also was in a good position to
                        know what anyone else in the administration might be doing since I
                        controlled the Swiss channel. As our protecting power in Tehran, the Swiss
                        were the only channel we used for communications with Tehran. All those
                        messages, including the forewarning of the launch of Desert Storm, came from
                        my directorate.</hi>

                        if you see anything happening because we're all looking for some sort of
                        change or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, but you have to realize the administration really had its hands full.
                    We were working flat out to conduct this war against Iraq which was a very broad
                    and just keeping Iran on the sidelines was about as much as we could handle at
                    that stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Then how did this going to the National Security

                        your view of the National Security Council?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: For the State Department, the NSC was always extremely important. Of
                    course, the president in our system maintains the last say on foreign policy and
                    the State Department was keen on having its people in key positions there so
                    even though the position that I was holding in running Gulf affairs was an
                    important job with a lot of responsibility, the Department and NEA in particular
                    decided that if I was selected to work at the National Security Council, they
                    would find some way of way of replacing me in Northern Gulf affairs. It was that
                    important to have someone from State in that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the National Security Council seen when you were in
                        NEA as being on the same team? Was there a rivalry or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: During the Gulf War, there was extraordinary cooperation among all U.S.
                    agencies, including between the State Department and the NSC. These were the
                    days of Brent Scowcroft and Bob Gates on the NSC, and Jim Baker and Bob Kimmitt
                    in State. They were thorough professionals and worked together extraordinarily
                    smoothly. We had no feuding, egos were under control and the overall objective
                    of defeating Saddam brought the whole interagency together. I think it was, for
                    many people, kind of a golden age of interagency coordination.</p>

                <p>HULL: A number of candidates were interviewed by Richard Haass and among them
                    they included people like Tom Miller and Molly Williamson, Bruce Riedel and
                    myself and from that group, Richard picked Bruce Riedel coming out of the CIA
                    and myself out of State.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: I reverted back to the Arab-Israeli problem and the Palestinians, Egypt,
                    Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and North Africa and my colleague Bruce Riedel
                    inherited the Gulf, the Arab Peninsula and South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression when you arrived at the National

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Scowcroft ran an extraordinarily lean and efficient organization. There was
                    a minimum of layering. We could e-mail General Scowcroft or Bob Gates directly.
                    Things like meetings were arranged very quickly. For example, when (Israeli
                    Prime Minister) Rabin, who was then in the opposition came to town, it took a
                    quick e-mail to Scowcroft's secretary, a meeting was scheduled and then you'd
                    follow up with another longer e-mail as a briefing memo in which you always
                    started with what the general sought to achieve in that meeting. And that was
                    the staff work. The meeting took place, and important contact was maintained,
                    the general got insight into the situation out in the Middle East and in many
                    ways it was the opposite of the State Department where a great amount of time
                    and effort was wasted on paperwork and clearances. A great deal of energy was
                    wasted to make it through all the hoops on the field and, as a result, the final
                    product was often bland and unimaginative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in sort of a normal day or week?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>HULL: One of the results of James Baker's extremely effective diplomacy during
                    the Gulf War was a pledge by the United States to deal with the Palestinian
                    question after the war concluded. Baker and Bush took that pledge quite
                    seriously and so in the aftermath of the war one of the enterprises that took a
                    lot of time was to push for resumption of negotiations between the Palestinians
                    and the Israelis and the other Arabs as well. You have to recall that in our
                    coalition to defeat Saddam Hussein we included not only longtime friends like
                    the Egyptians and the Saudis, but also people like the Syrians and we did see
                    here a golden opportunity to reshape the field in negotiations of the Arab-
                    Israeli question. Jim Baker undertook a concerted shuttle in the region backed
                    by President Bush to see if he could bring the Arabs and Israelis together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, but you're sitting at a desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My job in this regard was to be the White House representative on the Baker
                    shuttles and therefore this meant quite a bit of traveling in the region for
                    extended periods of time and then reporting back to Richard Haass in the
                    National Security Council and making sure that Haass and General Scowcroft had a
                    good picture of how the effort was developing. There was a great deal of
                    skepticism on the part of General Scowcroft of the effort because he saw the
                    tactical game, but he didn't see the strategic game. He didn't see what the
                    trade-offs were that actually would end up in the deal. In this, he had a valid
                    point. But, the effort itself was very important in terms of how the United
                    States was seen in the Middle East. So, a good deal of my time was spent on the
                    road with the Baker team.</p>
                <p>The other part of my time was spent really holding up my end of presidential
                    diplomacy. For example, the White House visits by President Mubarak of Egypt, by
                    King Hassan of Morocco. In those visits of course, the head of state coming from
                    the Middle East saw the key meeting as the one with the president. The NSC, at
                    least our NSC, took possession of those meetings in that we had our own ideas
                    about what we could accomplish. We did have inputs from the State Department and
                    other agencies around town, but in the final analysis we drafted the key
                    briefing memos, and we tried to shape the meetings to accomplish the desired
                    results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's took up take a look at some of the leaders. You had
                        King Hussein in Jordan, Shamir was the minister in Israel, Mubarak in Egypt,
                        Hassan in Morocco. These were the major players weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hull: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you take them one by one and sort of, what was, you
                        might say the group think or whatever it was from the NSC perspective about
                        their contribution and abilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>HULL: Let me start with Mubarak of Egypt. We had a lot of dealings with Mubarak
                    both in his visits to Washington and in Secretary Baker's visits to Cairo. Solic
                    is the word that comes to mind. He was not only physically stocky, but also in
                    terms of his thinking and his manner he had a great deal of experience, he had
                    Egypt's political weight and he brought to any subject very considered judgments
                    that usually wore very well. Therefore, U.S. statesmen hoping to accomplish
                    something in the Middle East were generally well advised to consult with him and
                    to listen carefully to his point of view. Mubarak was very ably assisted by
                    people like Osama al Baz, his brilliant national security adviser, whose career
                    spanned also the presidency of Anwar Sadat. So the Egyptians were a very strong
                    player.</p>
                <p>Jim Baker established a particularly good rapport with President Mubarak. Baker
                    was a brilliant negotiator. He had clearly in mind what he wanted to accomplish,
                    but he had a human touch and was appreciated by Arabs for his willingness to
                    take the time and make the effort to establish personal relations. I remember in
                    particular on a visit to Cairo Mubarak would lay out a lavish spread always
                    insist that we eat with him, which of course was traditional Arab hospitality.
                    Baker was very adventuresome in terms of culinary experiments, and he would try
                    everything, and he would ask questions and Mubarak would delight in explaining
                    what the various dishes amounted to. Little things like that helped Baker
                    establish a comfortable relationship.</p>
                <p>King Hussein of Jordan, of course, had been our long time friend, but Hussein had
                    backed Saddam Hussein in the war and had really torn his relationships in
                    Washington. It was more in sorrow than in anger that President Bush, Jim Baker
                    and others had to deal with King Hussein as an adversary, at least initially.
                    After the war, King Hussein obviously realized a mistake had been made and
                    undertook a very long and ultimately successful effort to reestablish those
                    close ties in Washington. On the shuttles Baker was positively disposed to
                    laying out for King Hussein a path of redemption and that path of redemption
                    really was a positive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process which King Hussein
                    did play with significant results. In turn, Baker tried to be helpful to King
                    Hussein. I remember one of our early shuttles in Amman we had an appeal from the
                    King to help reopen relations with Saudi Arabia and trade with Saudi Arabia.
                    Baker intervened with the Saudi royal family and ultimately got a relaxation on
                    border controls vis-�-vis Amman. Baker was always quite keen on hearing what an
                    interlocutor needed or wanted and then if it was reasonable, Baker would make a
                    sustained effort to deliver something, knowing that effort would build a
                    relationship and pave the way for his interlocutor to do something on his behalf
                    later on. I was fortunate in the shuttle as the White House representative. I
                    was almost always in the meetings with the heads of state or government. I think
                    this willingness of Bush (41) and Baker not to hold grudges, to give people who
                    had crossed them an opportunity to redeem themselves really was a hallmark of
                    their diplomacy and in the end proved a very wise course of action.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Hussein, of course was in a very difficult
                        situation. The problem was that he had a population that did not like Kuwait
                        at all and you know, in the long run it was a hell of a lot better to have
                        Hussein on the throne than having kicked out, but I don't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. His position was a very difficult one and his decision was
                    understandable. It turned out badly for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We also want to talk about Assad and the Saudis too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Assad was unique. He was sphinx-like. I think he grew to respect Baker
                    greatly. Part of Assad's style was to engage in extremely long meetings,
                    marathon sessions in which he would rehearse in agonizing detail the history of
                    the Arab-Israeli conflict and attempt to wear down his interlocutors and create
                    the context in which in any discussion in the future would take place. Baker was
                    quite able to run those diplomatic marathons, he was ably advised by Ed
                    Djerejian, previously ambassador in Damascus and then Assistant Secretary of
                    State. He understood that we did have an opening vis-�-vis Syria, they had been
                    on the right side of the Gulf War. They had sent troops to Saudi Arabia and
                    shifting them on the Arab-Israeli question would create significant new
                    opportunities. The attempt to maneuver around Syria, for example Phil Habib's
                    negotiations between Lebanon and Israel, had failed because on that front anyway
                    you could not make progress without Damascus going along.</p>
                <p>Shamir was another very, very tough nut and being from the Likud not really
                    feeling any political or strategic need to move. Shamir took a dim view of the
                    whole enterprise, and I believe feared that Israel would pay a price for
                    America's postwar diplomacy in redeeming its pledge to the Arabs. So from
                    Shamir, Baker got very little movement and those meetings were extremely
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>As for the Palestinians, by this time we had broken off our dialogue with the
                    PLO, so the Palestinian interlocutor had to come from the Occupied Territories.
                    We had tried that previously during the Camp David process and had come up
                    empty-handed. Baker, however, was determined. The PLO had also backed Saddam
                    Hussein and therefore was in a weakened position. The Arabs from the West Bank
                    and Gaza were clearly interested in a dialogue with the United States and with
                    doing something to relieve the burden of occupation. King Hussein in Jordan was
                    doing his utmost to broker an arrangement whereby local Palestinians could step
                    forward and play the role, be delegated to represent the Palestinians in the
                    Baker peace process. Among the Palestinians from the West Bank, Faisal Husseini
                    from Jerusalem was first and foremost. He was a very moderate fellow, very
                    sensible. He came from a historic Palestinian family that had played a
                    leadership role in the Palestinian national movement. He was not corrupt, and he
                    was viewed as someone with great integrity by other Palestinians. He had some
                    very difficult decisions to make in the peace process as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>And then there was a question of getting more generalized support from the Arabs,
                    from the Saudis who could relieve the problems of Jordan and from North
                    Africans, like King Hassan of Morocco, getting them to back the general peace
                    process and eventually be willing to commit to participation in the multilateral
                    negotiations. Baker's diplomaclike Kissinger's before hiwas very wide
                    ranging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were a group of people Baker dubbed the “peace processors”. They
                    included Dennis Ross, Bill Burns, Dan Kurtzer, Aaron Miller, and myself. We
                    provided Baker with the substantive details he needed to have effective
                    meetings. We would have a session with the secretary about the upcoming meeting
                    and what we hope to accomplish wherever we were, be it Tel Aviv or Cairo or
                    Amman. This might end at seven or eight o'clock or it might be on the plane as
                    we were leaving one capital to go to another and then the peace processors late
                    in the night and sometimes in the wee hours of the morning would put the flesh
                    on the bones that Baker had outlined. Baker would wake up the next morning, and
                    he would have very inclusive talking points tailored to either Shamir, Hussein,
                    Mubarak, or Assad so he could go into a meeting very well prepared. We also kept
                    very close track of what the parties wanted and what we could deliver to the
                    parties. Baker kept score. He would try to take into his accounts whatever the
                    head of government or head of state had stated as his desire. He would see which
                    of those desires he could actually make happen, he would keep track of it and in
                    the next session he would remind Shamir or Hussein or Mubarak just exactly what
                    he had done for them in the interval. He built up steadily and immeasurably a
                    great deal of political capital with the various parties. We also, of course,
                    did matrixes of what the parties wanted from each other and what the trade-offs
                    would be and those were what we used to put together the letters of assurances
                    and really, the deal that amounted to the Madrid Summit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling while you were doing this that there
                        was possibly a final solution to the Arab-Israeli problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I don't think that we saw the final solution and its outlines at this
                    stage. What we saw as possible was creating a dynamic.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>So we were focused primarily on creating a diplomatic framework for getting the
                    Israelis and the Arabs seated at negotiating tables, and getting a positive
                    dynamic in the Middle East. We envisioned a two-track process. One track would
                    be direct Israeli negotiations with the Palestinians, with the Syrians and with
                    the Lebanese. Secondly, we envisioned a much broader multilateral negotiating
                    process whereby we would bring in Arabs from throughout the Arab world to sit
                    down with the Israelis and talk about issues of general interest. For example,
                    arms control or refugees or economic development, and by so doing create a
                    positive atmosphere in which the elements of a final solution could emerge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there sort of feeling that, I mean, one looks at this
                        and one feels that maybe some maneuvering but basically the settlements
                        would have to go and the Palestinians weren't going to be able to go home.
                        Was that your feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, we didn't get to the point of addressing the refugee question except
                    in the later multilateral talks, post-Madrid. And there were very strong
                    debates. The Palestinians insisted on the principle of the right of return. We
                    were trying to come up with interim steps, more practical ways to improve
                    conditions and not yet trying to define what the final solution would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This shuttle diplomacy ended up with the Madrid
                        conference? Is that how it worked or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: There were two points in Baker's shuttle. He launched these things of
                    course with no assurance that it would get anywhere. You had an Israeli
                    government that really was not interested in a peace process. You had great
                    skepticism among people like Brent Scowcroft who couldn't see the deal, the kind
                    of final deal that you're asking about. But Baker persevered and used all his
                    diplomatic skills. The first break through really came in a letter that he
                    eventually received via Ed Djerejian, our ambassador in Damascus. Baker recounts
                    this in his autobiography that deals with this diplomacy. Baker on one of his
                    visits to Damascus really lays down for Assad the basis on which he can get the
                    Israelis to the table and he asks Assad to agree. Assad comes back with requests
                    for assurances. We provided a letter assurances to Damascus as well as to the
                    other direct parties. But Baker had as a principle not providing secret
                    assurances. In other words, anything that we would provide to one party we would
                    share with all the parties so that they would see where our position was. That
                    meant a lot of very careful crafting of language so that we could be responsive
                    to some Damascus requirements. For example, some participation of the UN in the
                    process but without crossing the Israeli red line on an active UN role. Based on
                    that painstaking drafting and assurance effort, Ed Djerejian eventually phoned
                    Jim Baker and told him we had a written response from Assad that he agreed to go
                    to the negotiating table. Baker was so skeptical at the time that in announcing
                    it in Washington he said, “My ambassador in Damascus believes” and it turned out
                    that Ed Djerejian had read it correctly, and we did have Syria coming to the
                    table.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>The next critical point was Palestinian representation. The Israelis were adamant
                    that that could not be the PLO, and it would mean the PLO making an historic
                    concession in allowing people from the territories to represent the
                    Palestinians. We were out to Jerusalem, we required of the Palestinians I think,
                    something like 13 names that we would then convey to Shamir, and Shamir would
                    agree that they were acceptable being legitimate people from the Occupied
                    Territories. The whole enterprise was even more painful in that the Israelis
                    were refusing to have anyone from Jerusalem to be in the Palestinian delegation
                    which meant that Faisal Husseini, our leading interlocutor, could not himself be
                    at Madrid and this meant a great personal sacrifice on his part.</p>
                <p>Parenthetically, Husseini would tell a joke that I found apt. “Negotiating with
                    the Americans was like someone who goes to tailor to have a suit made, and the
                    tailor insists on making the suit with whatever cloth was available. Therefore,
                    one sleeve would be shorter than another sleeve, one elbow slightly lower and
                    the pants would be a little bit too short. And then the individual with that
                    suit made in America would try to wear it the best he could. Critics, including
                    the Americans, would then comment on how awkward he appeared.”The climactic
                    meeting with the Palestinians was at the East Jerusalem building of the American
                    Consulate on Nablus Road. We generally met in West Jerusalem, but Baker decided
                    he would go over to the other side to show that he was trying to reach out to
                    Palestinians. We were there meeting, the Palestinians came forward. They had
                    only about six names, about half the names that they required. Baker was
                    extraordinarily frustrated. He slammed his book shut, walked out of the room. He
                    used his tried-and-true threat “to leave a dead cat” at the Palestinian door,
                    which the Arabs never quite understood but it sounded like something you didn't
                    want to happen and left behind a very shaken Palestinian delegation.</p>
                <p>We went back to the King David Hotel. The Russian foreign minister was in town,
                    and this had been planned as the announcement of the Middle East Peace
                    Conference, the Russians and the Americans announcing it jointly. But Baker was
                    so discouraged that he consulted with Dennis Ross and decided that we weren't
                    there yet and he could not make that announcement. When Dennis came out and told
                    that to the peace processors there was a revolt in the ranks. People like
                    myself, Dan Kurtzer, Bill Burns, Aaron Miller thought that we had come too close
                    to give up. There had been previous history in the peace process when the
                    Americans had not seized the day and events had unraveled. The group of us felt
                    that we were at one of those moments again where the stars were aligned, but if
                    we did not act they could not stay aligned. Dennis to his credit, allowed the
                    group to come and make its argument directly to Baker. And we made this argument
                    that the Palestinians were on board in principle, had not yet come up with their
                    full list of names but the six that they had come up with were acceptable, that
                    we needed to act to announce the conference and that the Palestinians would
                    eventually would come through with an acceptable delegation. Jim Baker was
                    persuaded and changed his position, made the decision, went downstairs and with
                    his Russian counterpart announced the invitation to Madrid.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>We took off from Ben Gurion Airport, headed toward Madrid to take a look at the
                    arrangements. None of us knew whether or not the Palestinians would come
                    through, but eventually we got word that indeed, they had filled out their
                    delegation in an acceptable way and had even asked that having finally done so
                    they be characterized by the United States as the first delegation to accept the
                    invitation! In all of this, King Hussein had played a very positive and useful
                    role in reassuring Shamir that the names that would eventually come would be
                    acceptable to Israel. On that flight to Madrid, I remember talking with Margaret
                    Tutwiler, Jim Baker's very close assistant and the one who handled press
                    relations for Baker, and asking Margaret how Madrid had been selected as the
                    site because Baker played those cards extremely close to his chest and even many
                    of us in the party had not known. In fact, what Baker had done was to ask of all
                    possible participants a list of three acceptable venues. The Hague was initially
                    the front runner, but was subsequently excluded by one of the parties, and
                    Madrid was a compromise second choice. We landed in Madrid. We got full support
                    from the Spanish. Baker immediately had a team come to the capital to begin the
                    preparations because the conference was only a matter of weeks away. People like
                    Patrick Kennedy and DCMs from throughout the Middle East came to liaise with the
                    Israeli and Arab delegations and to put together the Madrid Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point what was the feeling? You were saying that
                        the constellations looked like they were coming together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, in many ways Madrid, when it occurred was an historic occasion. You
                    have the Israelis and Arabs sitting down publicly for the first time. It was a
                    very contentious meeting. There was a lot of back-and-forth on arrangements.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, Madrid was supposed to spawn two sets of negotiations: the
                    bilateral set of negotiations involving the Palestinians-Jordanians and
                    separately, the Syrians, and then a multilateral set of negotiations involving a
                    much broader representation from the Arab world. The Syrians were adamantly
                    opposed to the latter which they thought premature until the bilateral
                    negotiations had yielded fruit. So the Syrians decided to absent themselves from
                    the multilateral talks. Nevertheless, they go forward, and they set off a long
                    period of diplomacy in the Middle East where Israelis and Arabs were talking
                    about a broad range of issues in constructive way that in retrospect looks like
                    a golden period of Middle East diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well do you think you were served by, I mean you at
                        your level by various sources of information, from our embassies, to the
                        Department, to the intelligence agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>HULL: I think we had a good feel for the other leaders and their situations in
                    part because the our embassies were staffed by some of our best and brightest,
                    but also in part because Baker by this time had such an intimate knowledge of
                    the other leaders that he could read them very well indeed. There were obstacles
                    and the two greatest were, on the part of the Israelis, ongoing settlement
                    construction and, on the part of the Arabs, the terrorist attacks. Each of these
                    would create significant political problems for the other side in terms of
                    staying with the negotiations. So we all did our best to discourage both
                    terrorism and settlement construction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there very much success in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, the most dramatic action taken against settlement construction was
                    President Bush's decision to link loan guarantees to settlement activity. I was
                    back in the NSC at this stage in Washington as the decision was being made. It
                    was the president's own decision. He felt very strongly that settlements were an
                    obstacle to peace; he felt that he had gotten from Shamir a commitment not to
                    extend settlements; he felt that the United States needed to do something
                    significant to signal the Israelis than this was unacceptable to us. I'm sure
                    that Secretary Baker welcomed this resolute stand, but he did not have to
                    convince the president to do it. It was the president's own mind in this regard.
                    We on the staff did detailed papers creating the language linkage. On the day
                    that it was announced the president did so in a very dramatic fashion. He said
                    he was one man standing against a multitude of lobbyists, referring to the
                    Israeli lobby and its clout on the Hill. He was excoriated by many of Israel's
                    supporters for taking this step. I remember my boss, Richard Haass was scheduled
                    to talk to a delegation of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)
                    that day. Richard begged off because of other responsibilities and so it fell to
                    me to address the AIPAC meeting. I walked into the room in the Old Executive
                    Office Building and immediately you could feel the tension and hostility. Some
                    of the participants could barely contain themselves. As soon as I was
                    introduced, one fellow jumped to his feet and began to attack the president on
                    his decision on loan guarantee. I gave him time to speak, then I told the group
                    that I welcomed the chance to meet with them, and I wanted to talk to them about
                    the loan guarantee decision but before I did that I wanted to talk to them about
                    where we were in the peace process because I just returned from one of Baker
                    shuttles.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>So I spent the first 20 minutes of the meeting really talking to them about what
                    we were trying to do in the Middle East and our efforts with Syria and the
                    Palestinians. This was all about a settlement that would guarantee Israel's
                    future. Being able to give a first-hand account of the enormous effort that
                    Baker and the president were making changed the framework of the discussion.
                    Loan guarantees became an element of contention between us, but an element of
                    contention within the context of a much larger agreement on what the United
                    States was trying to do to promote peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
                    That and the fact that some of my questions were really personally abusive, I
                    think gained me the sympathy of the gathering and the session went off rather
                    well. But the president's actions were held against him by the Israeli lobby and
                    some in the Bush 43 administration continue to felt that it was a political
                    mistake although diplomatically the correct thing to do. According to Margaret
                    Tutwiler at a subsequent NEA chiefs of mission meeting, it was one of the
                    considerations that Bush 43 maintained in his mind throughout his dealings with
                    the Middle East. At that stage, Margaret was ambassador in Rabat, but very much
                    plugged into the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the idea of using the loan guarantee as a weapon, did
                        that originate in the NSC or where did that originate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The idea of holding the Israelis accountable for their settlement activity
                    originated, as I said, with the president himself. The loan guarantee was a
                    convenient vehicle because the Israelis had come to us asking for that.
                    Therefore, it was on the table and subject to an appropriate linkage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain just a bit about the loan guarantee.
                        What was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Israelis were engaged in economic reform. They needed to access capital
                    from international markets. If the United States would co-sign those loans,
                    guarantee their repayment in other words, then the Israelis could get
                    significantly lower interest rates for that money borrowed and, therefore, it
                    was another form of assistance to Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election of '92 was cranking up. Was that reflected in
                        our dealings with the Middle East at that point? That all of a sudden
                        interest began? You had a huge move away from real diplomacy into political
                        diplomacy or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. It had an impact, and I think the most dramatic impact was that as the
                    president approached election day, and his campaign was not doing well, he
                    brought Jim Baker over from the State Department to take charge of the campaign
                    belatedly which meant that our engine for progress in the Middle East peace was
                    decoupled from the train. The president's staff, I remember Brent Scowcroft felt
                    that the president would be reelected. They thought that Clinton's lack of a
                    military career weighed against him. I remember on hearing that thinking that in
                    my generation that was not necessarily the case. Many people had chosen a path
                    other than Vietnam. In the end, from my perspective, it seemed like the
                    perception of a double dip in the recession was what doomed the president's
                    reelection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the situation in the Middle East toward the
                        end was dissipating? And I mean as far as the opportunity or did you feel
                        that things were still on course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We felt that we had considerable momentum in the peace process. Remember
                    that the both the bilateral talks were ongoing and the multilateral talks were
                    ongoing at this stage, and we had a lot of participation from both the Israeli
                    and the Arab sides. We also had the prospect of Rabin taking over from Shamir
                    and as I said, we had kept in touch with Rabin even in opposition. We knew that
                    he was, unlike Shamir, serious about making a deal. It was clear to us, that
                    Rabin wanted to sequence negotiations and, if possible do a deal with Syria and
                    then turn to the Palestinians. With the prospect of a Labor government coming in
                    in Jerusalem, actually the negotiating prospects were improved. But Bush lost
                    and the transition between Bush 41 and Clinton presented some real
                    challenges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the challenges. Were you there during the
                        transition time or did you get cleared out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No. We were asked to stay on. Richard Haass was replaced by Martin Indyk
                    and I think as a testament to the accomplishments of the Bush Middle East team,
                    there was lots of continuity in the peace process. You had Dennis Ross
                    continuing at State, as well as Dan Kurtzer and Bill Burns and Aaron Miller. I
                    continued at the NSC. Ed Djerejian had become assistant secretary of state under
                    Baker. He continued as assistant secretary of state for the transition, but
                    there were some tricky issues with the Clinton administration coming in. The
                    most difficult was the question of Jerusalem. When Clinton was a candidate, he
                    had made some campaign pledges which included moving the U.S. embassy from Tel
                    Aviv to Jerusalem. When he was elected and took over, the Clinton people were
                    inclined to make good on that pledge. Those of us who were involved in
                    negotiations saw that move as something that would totally derail the process.
                    There were meetings in which I remember Ed Djerejian and others meeting with
                    Clinton's people.g. Sandy Berger, Tony Lakand arguing vehemently that this was a
                    step that would derail the process. One of our significant accomplishments was
                    convincing the new people to put that on the back burner and not to implement
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The new administration, as is the case with most administrations, took a lot of
                    time gearing up. The initial forays in the Middle East peace were very cautious
                    ones, and I do think we lost opportunities in that period, especially vis-�-vis
                    the Palestinians as we held to a very rigid position on the PLO and the
                    Palestinians from the inside the territories had very little room to negotiate
                    apart from the PLO. What was actually happening was that the American side was
                    holding to this rigid, no contact policy. Meanwhile, the Israelis under Rabin
                    were actually engaged with the PLO in Oslo and generating the Oslo Accords which
                    we only had a vague awareness of and really no direct role in bringing
                    about.</p>
                <p>I would mention, however, another very significant thing that happened in this
                    period and that is the first bombing of World Trade Center by Ramzi Yousef. This
                    was within months of President Clinton taking over and it was a great shock to
                    the new administration to be hit in New York by people from the Middle East. I
                    recall that it coincided with a visit by President Mubarak. Traditionally, early
                    in each new president's administration, there are visits by the Israeli prime
                    minister, the Egyptian president and other significant Middle East leaders and
                    therefore, we were having the Mubarak visit. Mubarak told the press on his way
                    to Washington that he had warned the administration about the attack on the
                    World Trade Center. President Clinton was livid and wanted to know whether it
                    was true and why this person whom he had never met before was embarrassing his
                    administration by this claim.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, it wasn't literally true. The Egyptians had never given any
                    specifics on such an attack. At most, Mubarak had mentioned generally the forces
                    of radicalism and risks pursuant thereof. So we had to explain to President
                    Clinton what it amounted to and then somehow keep the visit from being a
                    diplomatic disaster. I remember our Oval Office briefing of President Clinton.
                    Ambassador Robert Pelletreau was there who was the ambassador in Cairo. The
                    president turned to the State Department and asked essentially, “Where is this
                    guy coming from?” And Bob Pelletreau gave a brilliant thumbnail sketch of
                    Mubarak and his personality, his mindset, his political situation and managed to
                    smooth over the hard feelings. After Pelletreau spoke, Vice President Gore
                    supported his presentation and said, in effect, “Mubarak is a good guy, and we
                    can work with him.” I think Clinton although he was quick to anger was also
                    quick to get over his anger and never lost sight of the strategic value of
                    setting off on the right foot with key leaders. So he put behind his irritation
                    and the visit turned out to be a very successful one and the relationship stood
                    the Clinton administration in good stead for the eight years.</p>
                <p>I emphasize the World Trade Center attack because it did, at a very early stage
                    in the Clinton administration, represent its “blooding”, in the English sense,
                    on the issue of terrorism and counterterrorism. We would see later with Al Qaeda
                    that the Clinton administration was disposed to take terrorism as a serious
                    issue from the early days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain why this move of Jerusalem of our
                        embassy which has always been, when the New York primaries come around
                        pledges are made by candidates because of the Jewish vote of New York City
                        more or less, and oh yes, we'll do something about that. It never happens.
                        Why does it continue to be such a critical issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Israeli governments are always intent on creating “faits accomplis”,
                    whether politically or materialle.g. with settlements in the Occupied
                    Territories. They want to establish a political fact that Jerusalem is
                    nonnegotiable, an inalienable part of the state of Israel. They want to take it
                    off the negotiating table whereas the Arabs want to keep it on the negotiating
                    table. A move of our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would represent U.S.
                    acquiescence in the Israeli “fait accompli.”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay with the Clinton
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I stayed with the Clinton National Security Council for a period of about
                    four months. I had gotten an offer from Bob Pelletreau, for whom I had worked in
                    Tunis, to come to Cairo as his deputy chief of mission. For me, that meant being
                    number two and in effect being the day-to-day manager of the largest U.S.
                    embassy in the world. It was a great opportunity. It also got me out of the
                    Washington political battles and back over to the Middle East. So I was
                    delighted to accept that offer and left the National Security Council and had a
                    very able replacement in David Satterfield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel, it was still early on but Warren
                        Christopher was our new secretary of state. Did you get any feel for his
                        engagement? He had a great deal to do with getting our hostages out of Iran
                        but other than that did you get any feel for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>HULL: I had known Warren Christopher indirectly because I was staff aide to Hal
                    Saunders during those negotiations and they were an impressive diplomatic
                    accomplishment, a very complex agreement which protected U.S. interests and
                    helped get our colleagues back. So I had a great deal of respect for Warren
                    Christopher. I thought he was a very effective diplomat. His style was entirely
                    different from Jim Baker's. Whereas Jim Baker was outgoing, personable and
                    willing to try anything including what was served at dinner, Warren Christopher
                    was quite reserved. If he could skip a meal, he would do so and really had a
                    personality that in some ways did not sit well with Middle Eastern diplomacy. My
                    vantage point at this time was Cairo, and there were dramatic differences for
                    example, in the way that Mubarak had viewed Baker and the way he viewed
                    Christopher. That's not to say that Christopher was not committed, hard-working
                    and in a way effective because he made up in his intellect and his attention to
                    detail what he lacked in terms of personal rapport. I remember with Christopher
                    you were in hot water if you gave voice to the standard diplomatic complaints
                    about lawyers. There's often among diplomats a frustration with nitpicking and
                    legality but if in Christopher's presence one would say something like, “Well,
                    that's just a legal detail,” Christopher would bring him up short and remind him
                    that he Warren Christopher had made his fortune as a lawyer paying attention to
                    just those kinds of details. So we guarded our tongues in this regard when we
                    were with Secretary Christopher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Egypt from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This was '93 to '96.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say that was the situation in Egypt, not
                        American related but situations in Egypt in '93 when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hall: The situation was very tenuous. There was a wave of terrorism ongoing from
                    the Islamic Jihad and the “Gamaat Islamiya”, (the Islamic Grouping). Tourists
                    were being targeted and Egyptian officials, including the prime minister were
                    being targeted. In the New York Times, I recall, Chris Hedges was writing
                    stories that ran on the front page comparing Egypt at that time with Iran in the
                    last days of the Shah. In effect, he was predicting an Islamic revolution in
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>We had a big embassy, the biggest in the world. We had a lot of exposure. We were
                    greatly challenged to safeguard everyone. In that, we had full cooperation from
                    the Egyptian security services and intelligence services. Still, I recall being
                    tasked by the Department to have meetings at which we would lay out tripwires
                    for drawdown of the embassy so much was the concern that we were in a
                    pre-revolutionary stage.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>HULL: The embassy differed from the readings from people such as Chris Hedges. We
                    saw a very serious problem. We saw a threat to the regime. We didn't disagree
                    about that. But we also saw the regime having great strengths; Mubarak's
                    leadership itself, the long-standing deference that Egyptian leaders had
                    received since the days of the Pharaoh, the personal and family interests in
                    stability. We didn't see a regime in its last days. With the Shah, you had
                    wavering leadership. The Shah himself was ill, uncertain, unable to make
                    decisions. In Iran, you had fractures in the security services, the military
                    disintegrating and refusing to carry out their duties. You had the population
                    alienated, the middle class in Tehran turning against the regime. You didn't see
                    those same elements in Egypt, and I recall one particular riot that occurred. It
                    was a civil disturbance, in this case. It was directed by Islamic extremists
                    against nightclubs on Pyramid Street. In this instance, the owners of the
                    establishments and their friends came out and defended their property. Also, the
                    Islamic extremists overplayed their hand.</p>
                <p>For example, an assassination attempt resulted in the death of a 12-year-old
                    Egyptian girl who was obviously an innocent bystander. The government did a good
                    job of highlighting that fact, and the popular reaction against the terrorist
                    groups was very strong. They started to lose more and more mass support in their
                    campaign. I was personally convinced the tide had turned one day when there was
                    an assassination attempt against an Egyptian general as he heading up to the
                    citadel. It failed and the people who made the attempt then tried to flee into
                    Cairo's “city of the dead,” the cemeteries which are populated and provide
                    housing for a good part of the Cairo population. As they tried to flee, they
                    were captured not by the security forces but by Egyptian citizens and handed
                    over to the security forces. It seemed to me at that stage when the government
                    had the active support and involvement of the Egyptian population, they had won
                    the battle against the terrorists. That proved to be the case and by the end of
                    my time there, by '96, the situation was much stabilized.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're in charge of running this embassy. How did you find
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Cairo was magnificent as an embassy. It had wonderful traditions, the best
                    and the brightest of the Foreign Service had served there. Herman Eilts in the
                    days of Henry Kissinger and then Roy Atherton after he had been assistant
                    secretary, Nick Veliotes also after he had been assistant secretary, Frank
                    Wisner who was a legend among the Egyptians and then Bob Pelletreau who was one
                    of the best and brightest. It had attracted at the country-team level and in the
                    lower ranks too, the best the Foreign Service had or the best AID had or the
                    best that the CIA had and so I was in a very privileged position of directing a
                    team of people who knew what they were doing and who needed very little
                    motivation or guidance to do outstanding jobs. My real challenge was to
                    coordinate these various activities so that they would be more than the sum of
                    their parts, and that we would accomplish the mission objectives.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find for example the huge AID operation? How
                        did you find it? One can't help but you know, if you've got legions of
                        accountants sometimes I wonder you know, whether if some of the AID
                        operation wasn't, our aid was more paying for Americans to be there than
                        they accomplished. What was your feeling on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, you're right. The AID operation I had known in the early '80s when I
                    was there in the political section and then again in the mid-'90s as deputy
                    chief of mission. There had traditionally been, what shall I say, guerrilla
                    warfare between State and AID. The AID bureaucrats, who were extremely canny,
                    had fought very hard to retain their independence and to concentrate their
                    efforts on sustainable development with as little political intervention as
                    possible. Under Pelletreau the AID director was Hank Bassford.
                    Uncharacteristically, Ambassador Pelletreau and Hank Bassford had a very good
                    relationship and there was a lot of professional respect on both sides. I think
                    Bassford was wise enough to trim his sails to meet political requirements, and
                    Bob Pelletreau was wise enough not to challenge AID's professional judgment and
                    so it operated fairly smoothly during my tenure as DCM.</p>
                <p>There were, however, challenges. I will give you an example. After the Oslo
                    Accords, the implementing agreements were negotiated to a very significant
                    extent in Cairo because Mubarak was an acceptable host for both the Israelis and
                    the Palestinians. There would be quick, short-term requirements to help get this
                    Palestinian authority up and operating. For example, Arafat needed vehicles for
                    his security forces if he was going to take effective control of security in the
                    West Bank and Gaza ,and we were talking about a need over a matter of months, if
                    not weeks. And, of course, AID's idea of a timeline was a year or two. So we
                    undertook the challenge of somehow coming up with an AID program that could get
                    vehicles on the ground in the Palestinian territories in a matter of weeks and
                    we actually managed to do it by extraordinary effort. I thought this was a
                    shining hour for AID, and I'm sure it was appreciated by people like Warren
                    Christopher. One day when I was addressing an AID retreat, and I referred to
                    this agreement as one of their great successes over the past year. Afterwards,
                    good friends from AID came up to me and informed me that I was referring to what
                    many in AID had seen as one of their great defeats! So I had a reality check on
                    the different cultures at play. Of course, we've seen that cultural battle being
                    fought out in the years since then with AID losing more and more ground to the
                    extent that now it's a shadow of its former self and the secretary of state has,
                    with the support of Congress, achieved more and more control over AID's
                    functioning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view dealing with turning or keeping Egypt as
                        a functioning or sort of a quasi democracy but as a functioning unit? One
                        thinks of the population getting bigger and bigger and it looks like a
                        disaster.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>HULL: Egypt always looks like a disaster, but that should not be cause for
                    complacency. We determined early on that we needed an extraordinary effort for
                    reform, and we got White House support for it in the form of a Gore-Mubarak
                    initiative. Vice President Gore decided he was going to concentrate on a select
                    number of important countries. Egypt was included, Russia was included and
                    commissions were set up that paired the head of government or head of state with
                    the vice president. Vice President Gore came to Cairo regularly over this period
                    and worked very purposefully, very directly on the question of economic reform.
                    I think that, although progress is in Egypt is rarely dramatic, he did lay the
                    foundation for Egyptian economic reform that has slowly transpired since that
                    period. I think it a credit to him that he sustained that effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does there seem to be any real future for Egypt? You know,
                        huge population settled around sort of one city, not much out there in the
                        hinterlands. What's going to sustain it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: One of the most important things we did early on in our AID program was to
                    concentrate on agricultural reform. I'm talking here not only about the '90s,
                    but in the '80s as well. We had for that reform Agricultural Minister Yusuf
                    Wali, who was an extremely competent and extremely powerful minister. He was not
                    only minister of agriculture, he was also secretary general of the ruling party
                    and by undertaking agricultural reform that got the Egyptian “fellahin”
                    reasonable prices for their products and by helping introduce agricultural
                    technology (hothouses, irrigation, new crops), USAID, succeeded in establishing
                    a solid economic basis for the Egyptian farmer. That's what has historically
                    carried Egypt through hard times.</p>
                <p>You still have the problem of 12 or 15 million people living in Cairo and a
                    lesser number, 5 million in Alexandria. There, the AID effort has made
                    appreciable progress in things like infrastructure. In 1982 when I went Cairo
                    for of first-time, we would have regular power brownouts, we would have regular
                    interruptions of the water supply, and we would have regular flooding of the
                    streets with sewage. The situation was draconian. It would take half an hour to
                    make a phone call. The level from which we started was so low, the quality of
                    life of the urban Egyptian was so low that in a way we had nowhere to go but up.
                    AID infrastructure projects addressed one after another these vital sectors so
                    that a modern telephone system was installed, the water system was made
                    functional, the sewage system was made functional. The Egyptian urban dweller
                    could see in his daily life measurable improvements. The kind of improvements we
                    haven't been able to do say in Baghdad since the recent war we were able to
                    accomplish in Cairo. That and the Egyptians' traditional patience and low
                    expectations I think have allowed us to get through the past decades. I think in
                    terms of economic reform, the Egyptians have “religion,” and we will see
                    continued to see economic reform, much slower than we expect, much lower than we
                    would counsel on an Egyptian timetable, but nevertheless, in the right
                    direction. I think political reform is a different question.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the impact of computer technology,
                        communications technology? Was that hitting Egypt at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. The Egyptians certainly took to cell phones in a big way and that was
                    fortunately left in the private sector and parceled out among several companies,
                    including Egyptian companies that now function throughout the Middle East. They
                    took to that very quickly and similarly with computers. The Egyptians are not
                    techno-phobic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities and the intellectual and
                        student class? How did we view them at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: You had essentially two kinds of universities. You had the American
                    University in Cairo which was an elite establishment to which the Egyptian
                    ruling class would try to send its children and which we supported to a
                    significant extent. And then you had public Egyptian universitiethe University
                    of Cairo, 'Ain Shamwhich were mega universities with 50,000 plus students,
                    classes routinely of hundreds, and very ill equipped. We would have dealings
                    with them, but it was very hard to get your hands around those establishments.
                    Those universities would often serve as the hotbeds of protest, but there was a
                    clearly understood rule that as long as the protests stayed on the campus, the
                    security forces would not intervene. If the students went off the campus and
                    tried to bring their protest to the rest of the city, then the security forces
                    would very quickly and very firmly crack down. You also had, of course, Al Azhar
                    Universitone of the oldest religious universities in the world dating from the
                    10th century. We maintained contact with Al Azhar, and it was producing some of
                    the most significant personalities in the Middle East because their graduates
                    would go on throughout the Arab world to very significant positions in
                    Islam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an Egyptian Islam at the time? I mean, you had
                        other Islams.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hall: Well, Al Azhar was the oldest institute of higher education in the Islamic
                    world, the most prestigious and its thinking was very highly revered, and it was
                    to a significant extent shaping the next generation of Islamic thinkers. In
                    addition, the Muslim Brotherhood was functioning just beneath the surface and
                    sprouting like-minded groups in places like Palestine, where Hamas traces its
                    origin back to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. And similarly throughout the
                    Arab world, Islamic fundamentalist groups were deriving their charters. their
                    thinking, their programs from the Egyptian source.</p>

                <p>HULL: I'd like to talk a little bit about reinventing government as it applies to
                    the embassy because we did take the that hallmark of the Clinton administration
                    seriously, and we did put it into effect in Embassy Cairo in a rather successful
                    way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about in Cairo and you're managing this huge
                        operation and we have the Clinton Administration coming along with, what is
                        it called? Reinventing government, or something?</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, we discussed earlier the problems in Embassy Cairo and the ambassador
                    really gaining meaningful control over the programs. You had a $1.3 billion in
                    security assistance, you had about $900 million in economic assistance coming in
                    every year, huge AID establishments, huge military establishments and to have
                    effective policy oversight of these resources was a daunting challenge and
                    particularly with the AID side. There had traditionally been antagonism between
                    the AID mission and the State component of Embassy Cairo as AID preferred to
                    function autonomously. The reinventing government thrust of the Clinton
                    administration, which was particularly championed by Vice President Gore,
                    provided us an opportunity to reinvent the embassy, and we did it in a
                    sustained, purposeful way. Our main vehicle was to create “cluster groups” which
                    were interagency which would focus on an element of importance in our bilateral
                    relationship. For example, the economic assistance element or the security
                    assistance element, and then we would bring into that group anyone in the
                    embassy who had something to say or something to do on the issue. So the
                    economic assistance group had the front office, it had AID people; it had people
                    from our economic section and other parts of the embassy, the agricultural
                    representative, for example. By doing that, we were able to get the ambassador's
                    oversight and policy guidance injected into the planning process rather
                    effectively, and we were able to create interagency working groups that had real
                    meaning in Embassy Cairo, especially given the magnitude of the resources that
                    were flowing in. We also took advantage of this exercise to bring into dynamic
                    roles the junior officers and younger people in the embassy because we needed
                    people on these groups to do drafting and to get out of the embassy and into the
                    field to see what is going on. So I think for a lot of the younger officers, it
                    gave them an opportunity to see resources and how they were being applied, to
                    have something to say about those questions and it was a very salutary
                    experience across-the-board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling having much time gone by but our
                        huge AID program to Egypt was from the outside it looked like frankly, a
                        payoff, a bribe as it kept the Egyptians from mucking around in Israel. And
                        then we're paying Israel. It sounds like were paying two powers that should
                        be able to keep from going at each other and here we are sitting back in the
                        United States paying both of them to be peaceful.HULL: Historically, of
                        course, the aid levels for both Egypt and Israel came out of the Camp David
                        Summit that also led to the peace treaty between the two countries. Both the
                        Israelis and the Egyptians were very successful at taking a one-time deal
                        and to turn it into an entitlement. To do this, they needed more than to
                        bamboozle the Executive Branch. They needed to get Congress to buy into
                        this, and both Tel Aviv and Cairo spent a lot of time, a lot of trouble
                        working with the congressional angle. President Mubarak was always available
                        for CODELs and they succeeded in turning those programs into entitlements
                        which I think in retrospect was really not a very good deal for U.S.
                        interests because over time, we didn't have nearly as much leverage as we
                        should have had with that amount of resources going in, and the Egyptians
                        didn't do nearly as many reform as they should have done with that amount of
                        resources.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view from Cairo on Israel, our embassy in
                        Israel, what the Israelis were doing during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, during this period it was a rather creative period in the peace
                    process because we had the Oslo process having produced principles for an
                    agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. So throughout this period
                    of time, we had quite a few shuttle visits by Secretary of State Christopher and
                    his peace team, and they were working with the Israelis and the Palestinians to
                    flesh out the principles of agreement from Oslo. The Egyptians were playing a
                    useful role in that whole process. So we have something to show in a tangible
                    way for the involvement of ourselves and the Egyptians. The tragedy was that the
                    agreements reached did not get implemented, and the United States did not adopt
                    an aggressive role in holding the parties accountable for what they had agreed
                    to in that process and so when Netanyahu's Likud government succeeded the Labor
                    governments, the Israelis effectively reneged on many of their requirements. For
                    his part, Yasser Arafat dragged his heels and reneged on his requirements. There
                    was no hard-nosed umpire to call the fouls and to keep the parties honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you say relations were between the two parties,
                        the American Embassy Cairo and the American Embassy Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I would say they were respectful, and we had an overarching common interest
                    which was the peace process. We had people who had served in both embassies so
                    there was not the sense of rivalry that characterized, for example, relations
                    between Embassy Tel Aviv and Consulate General Jerusalem when I was there in the
                    late 1970s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our Consulate General in Alexandria fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, we had a dynamic consul general in Alexandria. We had Frances Cook up
                    there for much of the time, and she was a natural phenomenon, unending energy,
                    extremely outgoing, kind of a perfect person to have at an important outpost
                    like that. I think the Egyptians in Alexandria felt very flattered by her
                    efforts and her attentions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Alexandria a different animal than Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Alexandria is quite different than Cairo. It is more Mediterranean, its
                    history, its geographic position, more cosmopolitan. Cairo, founded by the
                    conquering Arab armies, always looked more towards the east while Alexandria
                    always looks more north and into the Mediterranean world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations when you were there with Saudi
                        Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I would say they were correct. I think the Egyptians and Saudis appreciated
                    that they were leading forces in the moderate Arab camp. There was tangible
                    support from Saudis to Egypt. We tried to encourage in the security
                    relationshimore exchanges and participation for example by Saudi in exercises
                    like Bright Star, but we found the Saudis rather timid about their military
                    capabilities and nervous about showing up at any situation where they could
                    possibly get embarrassed. I think Mubarak played Arab politics very well. At
                    that stage, the Arab League had returned to Egypt so he had that instrument and
                    Esmat Abdul Majid, a former Egyptian foreign minister, as the secretary-general
                    of the Arab League, and so Mubarak was adept in managing his relationship with
                    the Arab world as a whole.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Qaddafi a factor at all at this point or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Qaddafi was not a factor. He was in his box more or less. Qaddafi was much
                    more a factor during the '80s when I was there, and Qaddafi was still
                    rambunctious. If you recall that was the era of the La Belle Disco bombing in
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our retaliatory bombing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Our retaliatory bombing and more. I don't know if we covered it or not. We
                    also had a secret mission from the NSC, Admiral Poindexter. Well, maybe I'll say
                    a few words about that. In the aftermath of the La Belle Disco bombing and our
                    attack on Tripoli, the NSC decided a more radical solution was needed. Admiral
                    Poindexter, the advisor to the president for national security, jetted out to
                    Cairo to propose to President Mubarak that the Egyptians invade Libya and depose
                    Qaddafi. At the time, Nick Veliotes was the ambassador, and we had a very strong
                    station as well as a strong embassy. This proposal was heard by Mubarak and then
                    Defense Minister Abu Ghazala, and their response was noncommittal which was
                    taken as a yes by the National Security Council which wanted to go full steam
                    ahead. The staff levels in the embassy were very dubious. Part of the plan
                    involved major movements of the Egyptian military into the Libyan desert, and as
                    Pol-Mil officer and with my colleagues in the office of military cooperation we
                    had a very good sense of what the Egyptians were capable of, and we felt
                    strongly that that magnitude of a move was not within the Egyptian capabilities.
                    Not to mention the fact that the preponderance of Egyptians military forces were
                    arrayed toward Israel which is what they, the Egyptians, considered to be their
                    real threat. We doubted that the military invasion was a practical plan, and our
                    colleagues in the station doubted that the proposed work with Libyan dissidents
                    was practical because they knew these characters. They knew they lacked
                    reliability, they lacked support inside Libya and they would be weak reeds for
                    our strategy.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>We briefed this to the ambassador, Ambassador Veliotes, who, I'm sure, had his
                    own misgivings about the whole enterprise. One result of this was that I got
                    sent back to Washington to brief the military facts of life to the State
                    Department, and I remember heading back with a map in my briefcase showing the
                    situation in the western desert of Egypt. I arrived on NEA's doorstep, and NEA
                    did not really know what to do with me. Arnie Raphael, who was principal deputy
                    assistant secretary at the time, had me cool my heels on the Egyptian Desk for a
                    couple of days and then finally he set up an appointment for me with the
                    undersecretary for political affairs. I went along with Arnie Raphael and went
                    up and went through my briefing of the practical problems involved in this
                    proposed NSC scheme. I got sent back to the Middle East and the project somehow
                    got strangled in the cradle because we did not get in bed with the Libyan
                    dissidents and the Egyptians did not get bogged down in the Libyan Desert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you are back to DCM in Cairo? Qaddafi was not
                        considered a major problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: No, Qaddafi was growing older and calmer, and Qaddafi had his own Islamic
                    fundamentalist threat as, of course, did Egypt in spades. So you are in a
                    situation where the times had changed, and the threats to the regimes had
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Sudan was an area in which the Egyptians were always interested because of
                    the Nile. They were very nervous about any activity upriver in Sudan or even in
                    East Africa. They had hoped to increase the flow of water to the Nile by
                    sponsoring the Jonglei Canal, which would have conserved Nile waters, but that
                    was going nowhere because of the war in the south. There was a “Khartoum
                    Spring,” so to speak, during this period when Al Mahdi returned to Khartoum, and
                    you had a brief period of Sudanese democracy. You had elections, party activity
                    and some Sudanese experts were very optimistic that Sudanese democracy would
                    take hold and flourish. In the end, that didn't happen, and the military
                    eventually stepped back into power which I don't think bothered the Egyptians
                    very much. They were primarily concerned that the Islamic leader Hassan al
                    Turabi and his ilk not gain or not sustain ascendancy in Khartoum. If it meant
                    that the military was in charge, well, that was something the Egyptians were
                    very comfortable with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there Egyptian elections continued to
                        be somewhat problematic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Formalistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that if they really had open elections
                        the fundamentalists might win?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>HULL: No. We in the embassy believed that if there were open elections, Mubarak
                    would win very comfortably. The Egyptian people had seen a great deal of
                    progress under Mubarak; their quality of life had improved, for some much more
                    than others but even across the board. The Egyptian peoples were trained and had
                    a long tradition of deference to the Pharaoh or whoever had a similar position
                    so ironically, the Egyptians could well have afforded at that stage freer
                    elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a growing gap between those who had influence
                        and those who didn't have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, clearly there was. The “Infitah” or economic opening up as they call
                    it had benefited some disproportionately and you had the phenomena not only of
                    the latest Mercedes driving through the slums of Cairo, but you had huge,
                    extravagant weddings being given by the leading families when many Egyptians
                    were living on beans and bread. So yes, the disparity in the incomes was
                    becoming not only apparent, but painful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something you could do anything about or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, certainly our agricultural policy and our assistance to the farmers
                    and the liberalization of agricultural markets benefited the rural population
                    very considerably, and a lot of it, as we discussed previously, a lot of the
                    stability of Egypt rested on that success. Our efforts to improve the
                    infrastructure of Cairo, the sewage, the water, that also had broad, very broad
                    benefits. We did not have particular programs to redistribute wealth or
                    redistribute land or any of those measures. Those weren't really in keeping with
                    the American political or economic thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any major visits? I'm sure you had a lot of Congress
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, we had Vice President Gore often because of the Mubarak-Gore
                    Commission and that was good because Al Gore was a serious man who followed the
                    issues and by getting repeated visits and follow-up, we were able to sustain
                    attention on key issues effectively. We also got President Clinton for one
                    visit. It was a lightning affair. He was scheduled to go out to the Middle East,
                    to Israel and elsewhere and shoehorned in a stop in Egypt. I still recall he got
                    in at something like 4 a.m. in the morning. The Meeting with Mubarak was about
                    nine, which was as early as you can conceivably have with an Arab leader, and he
                    was on his way by early afternoon. His one, very considerable disappointment was
                    that he could never get to the pyramids. His lodgings, and Mubarak insisted
                    putting him up in a palace, his lodgings were on the east side of town and the
                    meetings were on the east side of town. The pyramids are way outside Cairo on
                    the western side of town and the transit across Cairo was just too daunting
                    given the schedule we had. So as compensation after President Clinton's plane
                    took off, Air Force One circled the pyramids and gave him a view from the air at
                    least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to talk about the signing ceremony?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I wanted to mention the efforts of Secretary of State Christopher and his
                    peace process team throughout this period which brought results in the form of
                    agreements to implement the Oslo principles. These were difficult negotiations
                    and extended negotiations and not concluded until there were all-night
                    discussions involving the Americans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians and the
                    Israelis and even when you had an agreement ready for signature you're never
                    quite sure of it. On the day that the agreement was meant to be signed, we all
                    showed up at the venue as did the world's media only to have the representative
                    of the various governments including Secretary Christopher on the stage and then
                    stopped dead in their tracks because Chairman Arafat refused to sign the final
                    document. Even his own negotiating team had a hard time understanding what
                    Chairman Arafat's objections were. They presumably had something to do with a
                    map in the annex, but it was a very painful and a very long wait by the
                    principles in front of the world media while efforts were made and finally
                    successful and Chairman Arafat signed with a proviso. This was the last time to
                    my knowledge that Mubarak offered to make Cairo a venue for a signing ceremony
                    involving Chairman Arafat.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Senior Seminar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Senior Seminar was a great luxury. It was, I think, nearing the end of
                    its run. It was somewhat anachronistic, frankly. You had I think, good
                    representatives from the State Department because it was such an enjoyable
                    posting. The other agencies though were using it as a reward for perhaps people
                    who had served long and willingly, not necessarily up and coming people as it
                    was originally intended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then? This would be 1997?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: This would be '96 to '97. Well, my career hit a speed bump. Having been DCM
                    and charge for about nine months at the Department's largest embassy and having
                    been recognized by such things as the Baker-Wilkins Award for Management of an
                    Overseas Mission, which generally goes to one DCM every year, I had expected in
                    the next cycle to be promoted and to launch my career search and my job search
                    on that basis. But in the Foreign Service not everything happens as expected,
                    and the promotion list came out, and my name was not on it. This would have been
                    from OC to MC. I, therefore, found myself in an awkward situation and scrambling
                    for jobs in Washington which were not easy for me to find. I remember going to
                    Skip Gnehm, who was director general of the Foreign Service, and explaining to
                    him my plight. Skip throughout my career had been a source of very good advice
                    and what he told me was to find work that needed to be done and not to worry too
                    much about the rank of the job. Everything would sort itself out. So acting on
                    that advice, there was a job in the International Organizations Bureau in
                    peacekeeping, and Molly Williamson, the principal deputy assistant secretary,
                    asked me if I would take a look at the job. It was rated beneath the job that I
                    had done previously as DCM in Cairo, but peacekeeping work was significant and
                    so following Skip's advice I took the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this job from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I took it from 1997 to 1999.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the job. Where did it fit and what was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>HULL: I was director for peacekeeping and for humanitarian operations in the
                    International Organizations Bureau, and I reported to Molly Williamson, the
                    principal deputy assistant secretary, who was the deputy of Princeton Lyman at
                    that stage. It involved significant resources because the UN was conducting some
                    15 to 20 peacekeeping operations, and the U.S. was paying the lions' share of
                    the cost of those operations. That's where the rub was because we had a
                    Republican Congress, and both on the House and Senate side there was extreme
                    hostility toward the United Nations, particularly by Senator Helms who was then
                    chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The opponents had initiated
                    a watchdog operation on UN peacekeeping that required a State Department
                    representative, me, to go up to the Hill each month and to defend in front of
                    the authorizing and appropriating committee staff all ongoing and proposed UN
                    peacekeeping operations. The staff members were pit bulls when it came to the UN
                    peacekeeping. The monthly “Around the World” briefings were agonizing
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you prepare for this and where were the, you might
                        say, the soft spots, the problem spots?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, the points to criticize in the UN operations were legion and you
                    could not paper over them. The only approach that stood a chance of success was
                    candor and honesty and granting the criticisms that the legislative branch had
                    and doing our best in New York and in the field to correct as much as we could.
                    But what the well-intentioned staff wanted was the State Department to take the
                    issue seriously and to use the leverage that we had to correct it as much as
                    possible. They were not na�ve. They did not expect to reinvent the United
                    Nations overnight, but they wanted their criticisms to be taken seriously and so
                    that's what we did.</p>
                <p>We worked extremely hard and put a lot of pressure on the department of
                    peacekeeping operations (DPKO) in New York to try to improve UN performance. And
                    we succeeded. I'll give you an example. There was an operation in eastern
                    Slavonia, as part an effort to stabilize the Balkans in the former Yugoslavia.
                    That peacekeeping operation was run by an American, Jacque Klein, a former
                    military and a former Foreign Service officer. Jacque was a brilliant manager, a
                    great leader and did an extraordinarily effective job in eastern Slavonia. The
                    time came to bring that operation, we thought, to a close. It was not a negative
                    reflection on the work that was being done. In fact, it was an indication of the
                    success of the work that was being done. The UN bureaucrats, whose paycheck
                    depended upon continuing operations, fought a hard, guerrilla operation to keep
                    it going and to keep putting resources in. We played hardball and the
                    operation's plug was pulled. The OSCE moved in as a successor. As a result of
                    those kinds of efforts, we got enough credibility up on the Hill that we had a
                    decent working relationship, but Helms' staff, particularly Helms' staff was
                    always on the lookout for any evidence of softness in the State Department
                    position.</p>

                    <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you make nice to the staff or were the lines so
                        drawn they were always going to be opposed to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, you could not charm the staff. The staff was “uncharmable”. You could
                    not flimflam the staff. The staff, some of them like Jim Kulikowski, had been
                    following these operations in detail for years and years. You could not snow
                    these people. You could only be honest and candid, never promising more than you
                    could deliver, but making visible efforts to protect U.S. interests. Then you
                    gained their respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they coming from the idea that peacekeeping wasn't
                        worth it or was it that the United States shouldn't do anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: UN peacekeeping operations had historically turned into institutions in
                    themselves, entitlements. There were a lot of special interests being served in
                    the UN bureaucracy and in the field there were people involved in the
                    procurement process. A lot of money was flowing into these areas because you had
                    a UN peacekeeping operation so all these vested interests meant that the
                    operation became an end to itself and not a means to an end which was the return
                    to a normal situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was interviewing Ron Neitzke. When he was consul general
                        and then charg� in Croatia in the mid-'90s he was saying that UN
                        establishments in Bosnia, it is quite clear that they didn't want U.S. troop
                        intervention because this would break their rice bowl. I mean they had all
                        sorts of things, I mean, it was more than just what would be effective. They
                        were in a way protecting their job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: That was true in many, many of these situations. There were vested
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling of your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We felt like we were in the middle. We had “mission impossible”, an
                    adamant, ideologically, aggressive staff on the Hill and then we had in New York
                    one of the world's most impenetrable bureaucracies. We were the shock absorber
                    between those two forces and we got crunched repeatedly. It was, without a
                    doubt, the most difficult job I've ever had in the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much support anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>HULL: I think people appreciated us playing the role of shock absorbers. Our
                    superiors were happy they didn't have to go up and bear the brunt of the Hill's
                    questioning every month, but beyond that there weren't a lot of rewards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about some of the personalities? Who was our
                        ambassador to the UN during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Peter Burleigh was acting. We had a number of ambassadors. When we started
                    out it was Bill Richardson, now governor of New Mexico, who was a political
                    animal and who was effective in his own way. I was fortunate enough to travel
                    with him to the former Yugoslavia and watch him in action. Then Peter Burleigh
                    had a long tenure as charge and performed magnificently and should have gone to
                    bigger and better things, but fell afoul of the confirmation process and then
                    finally Dick Holbrooke toward the end came in, and he had his own style.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much support from the mission up in New
                        York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The mission had different priorities than we did. The mission was trying to
                    keep the international community happy and on our side and not to make too many
                    waves in the UN bureaucracy. They were of course, insulated from Hill pressure
                    that we were feeling on a daily basis so we were often at odds, not working at
                    cross purposes ,but certainly subjected to radically different pressures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you are there was the East Timor business going
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes, the East Timor business arose at the end of my tenure and was an
                    attempt, presented as an opportunity to come up with a reasonable peacekeeping
                    operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time he got there, how did you view what had
                        happened in the Balkans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Of course, I came at the Balkans having served on the National Security
                    Council under Brent Scowcroft and having seen Bush 41 people, Scowcroft and
                    Larry Eagleburger, not wanting to touch that with a 10-foot pole and then seeing
                    Madeleine Albright successfully inject U.S. power into the equation and really
                    move it to a successful course. So I had seen a great deal change in U.S.
                    policy.</p>

                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>HULL: One area where I think we did make progress was in the area of civilian
                    policing, CIVPOL, because it was clear in the former Yugoslavia that in a
                    post-conflict situation, stability and progress depended an enormous amount on
                    building, deploying and then maintaining policing capability, which was quite
                    different than a military capability. The UN, and the international community as
                    a whole, really lacked resources, the ability to do this. So Princeton Lyman
                    gave me as one of my objectives when I started the job doing what we could to
                    beef up CIVPOL. We worked on that with the UN Secretariat, with colleagues in
                    DPKO, and were able to pull together a conference in New York that was extremely
                    well attended in which for the first time the subject was discussed over two
                    days in a serious way and where we began to realize that although the U.S.
                    lacked resources in this area, other countries, Argentina, Italy and India for
                    example, had units, usually gendarmes or carabinieri, that could be put in
                    situations and serve as the bridge between military and police establishments as
                    we knew them. That work was also done in collaboration with the National Defense
                    University, Bob Oakley, Mike Djeijic and others, and I think we really did get a
                    much better understanding of the problems and solutions although I must say,
                    when you look at what happened in Iraq after our invasion, a lot of lessons
                    learned back in the late '90s had to be relearned again by the people who
                    entered Iraq and Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '98?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I left in 1999. My colleague from IO Mike Sheehan, who had done
                    peacekeeping at the National Security Council, but was not doing it at IO had
                    moved over to become the secretary's counterterrorism adviser, and Mike
                    recruited me to be his deputy in S/CT. For me, it was another question of doing
                    a job that needed to be done. Ironically, it turned out to be my ticket to an
                    embassy and in the period from '99 to '01 an area of increasing and eventually,
                    overriding importance to the State Department and the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did this job consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>HULL: Congress had decided, I believe in the '70s, that the State Department
                    needed to give more attention to terrorism. As structured, with regional and
                    functional bureaus, that wasn't going to happen so Congress at its best
                    legislated measures to address those problems and what they did was to legislate
                    the creation of an office, SCT, that would report directly to the secretary of
                    state and be concerned solely with counter terrorism. That office has had a
                    number of very strong leaders; people like Jerry Bremer, Peter Burleigh, and
                    Phil Wilcox. It had gone into a bit of a decline in the '90s, and there had been
                    efforts to fold it into another bureau, INL. Those efforts reflected a
                    misjudgment that the terrorism wave had crested and that we didn't need to pay
                    quite as much attention to this as we had in the past. Mike Sheehan was an
                    acolyte of Dick Clarke. He had worked with Dick at the National Security
                    Council, and Dick had used his considerable bureaucratic skills to get Mike
                    appointed to head SCT so he would have a compatible figure in that place in
                    State. Dick and Mike recognized, as would people like Dale Watson in the FBI,
                    and Cofer Black in the CIA, that terrorism had far from crested. In fact, there
                    was as a tsunami on the way in the form of Al Qaeda. The opening salvos in that
                    war had really occurred in Somalia, in Yemen in the early '90s and then vary
                    dramatically in 1998 with the successful Al Qaeda attack against our embassy in
                    Dar es Salaam in Nairobi. Both Dick and Mike saw that there was a lot more to
                    come. In S/CT from '99 to '01, we were people with a mission and that was to do
                    what we could to disrupt Al Qaeda, to warn the rest of the government and the
                    country of the threat that was gathering in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you reported directly to the secretary of state,
                        but this often sounds a lot fancier than it really is. Let's talk a little
                        bit about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It's a good point. It was meaningful in that the fact that we were
                    established in legislation meant that we couldn't be reformed, we couldn't be
                    subordinated by reform from within the State Department as had been attempted in
                    the '90s. It didn't mean though that Mike Sheehan got to meet with Madeleine
                    Albright. Although Mike had worked with Madeleine in New York, and she had been
                    comfortable with his choice, Madeleine didn't turn to Mike for her security
                    briefings. Madeleine Albright saw the counterterrorism issue as primarily an
                    issue of diplomatic security, how we protect our embassies, how we protect our
                    people. She turned to Dave Carpenter, who was the assistant secretary for
                    diplomatic security, which in my judgment was a very serious error because
                    whenever terrorism is dealt with passively, whenever the primary concern is
                    defensive (How do we protect ourselves?) rather than offensive (How do we go
                    after Al Qaeda?) then we're setting ourselves up for failure because we'll
                    always be there too little and too late in a defensive posture. As a result of
                    Albright's blind spot, Mike dealt with Tom Pickering, under secretary for
                    political affairs, because Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott also was not someone
                    who was comfortable with the terrorism portfolio. Therefore, in the division of
                    labor on the seventh floor, it fell to Tom Pickering. In Tom Pickering, we had a
                    brilliant and engaged principal, someone who very rarely would say “no” when you
                    needed him to get into the fight and do some of the diplomatic lifting so in
                    that regard, we were fortunate, but as you say, he was less than what Congress
                    had intended.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were bureaucratic guerillas. We were constantly butting heads with other
                    bureaus, particularly the regional bureaus, who also tended to downplay
                    terrorism and didn't want our demands harming bilateral relationships. So we
                    were constantly pushing NEA the Near East Bureau, and constantly pushing SA, the
                    South Asian Bureau, to do more on terrorism issues. For example, whenever
                    President Clinton would phone President Musharraf in Pakistan, we were always
                    insisting that we deal with the terrorism issui.e. to get Pakistan to use its
                    influence to get the Taliban to split from Al Qaeda and either to hand Bin Laden
                    over to us or to expel him to a third country like Saudi Arabia or in some way
                    disrupt the very effective operation that Al Qaeda had going on in Afghanistan.
                    While we would push to treat this as the priority issue, our SA colleagues would
                    have a number of other issues on everything from restoring democracy in Pakistan
                    to nuclear issues that affected India, the position of women in Afghanistan. It
                    was very hard to get a coherent, hard-hitting signal coming out of the U.S.
                    government out of the White House on the issue of Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. If you
                    look at the 9/11 Commission Report, you see that diplomacy in the pre-9/11
                    period was constantly evolving, and it was very hard to get effective pressure
                    on these players. We did what was then appropriate to do. We basically
                    designated bin Laden, designated Al Qaeda as a terrorist organization, and Bin
                    Laden personally. We put shackles on the Taliban in terms of their economic
                    relations. We eventually got a resolution passed in the UN Security Council that
                    imposed a unilateral arms embargo against the Taliban. We really exhausted our
                    diplomatic arsenal, but in the end it all proved too little in terms of applying
                    effective pressure on Bin Laden.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got there after the attacks on our embassies in East
                        Africa. We had launched I believe by that time missile attacks. What was the
                        feeling about these missile attacks in Sudan and in Afghanistan? Was it felt
                        that this sort of thing didn't work or was there, what was the thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, those had occurred before I was on board, but the lingering feeling,
                    I think, was twofold. Vis-�-vis Afghanistan the feeling was we did not
                    sufficiently harm Al Qaeda to be taken seriously. We hadn't gotten any of the
                    principals, the attacks had not been sustained. They had taken our punch, and it
                    really hadn't slowed them down. The attack on Khartoum on the chemical factory
                    was extremely controversial. The evidence that we had that it was involved in
                    chemical weapons production was not convincing. It was not something you could
                    lay on the table and get reasonable people to subscribe to. There was a feeling
                    vis-�-vis Khartoum that we had done it on the basis of very thin
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this lead you when you came on board to have
                        reservations about the intelligence, particularly the CIA, maybe military
                        intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>HULL: It was extraordinarily frustrating because George Tenet also “had religion”
                    about Al Qaeda, and the CIA and his Counterterrorism Center (CTC) was working
                    flat out. Because of the '98 bombings, the CIA and other intelligence generating
                    bodies were putting more intelligence out into daily distribution because no one
                    wanted to be responsible for having had a vital piece of intelligence and not
                    having distributed it so everyone was erring on the side of distribution.
                    Initially we had secure videos of teleconferences everyday of the workweek, and
                    then they scaled back to three days a week. They were chaired by the National
                    Security Council, Dick Clarke's office. They involved State, FBI, CIA, JCS, DOD,
                    Justice and others as necessary. We would go over in exhausting detail all of
                    the intelligence that indicated something might be afoot. We would be in touch
                    with our embassies and reporting on the reaction of the embassies and the
                    measures being taken by the embassies or our military forces. It was constant
                    high tension, hands-on management of a situation which we could only see through
                    a glass darkly. At times, this high-level attention would spike even higher
                    because George Tenet would have called Tom Pickering or seen him on the Hill and
                    handed over one or two juicy intelligence tidbits that indicated something was
                    going to happen and then the seventh floor would react, and we would be just
                    spun up trying to deal with what could be perceived as cries of wolf coming out
                    of the director of center intelligence.</p>
                <p>We would also get terribly spun up whenever we had a significant anniversary or
                    something like that, like the Fourth of July, because there was a natural
                    tendency to expect the worst to happen on those anniversaries or occasions.
                    Embassies would be closed down, and we would go into 24/7 mode. The Foreign
                    Emergency Support Team (FEST) at times would deploy to Europe. The whole
                    interagency process run by Dick Clarke and the counter terrorism security group,
                    the CSG, would just keep things in motion at an incredible level of
                    intensity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the role of Dick Clarke?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I came into the job not having had direct dealings with Dick, but with very
                    grave reservations about his style and his judgment. Having served in regional
                    bureaus, I had a feeling that he was a loose cannon and very disruptive of
                    relationships. When I worked in the job at S/CT, that opinion changed
                    dramatically. I grew to see Dick as a brilliant bureaucrat, and someone who
                    broke china but didn't do it haphazardly. He had a purpose and a message, and it
                    was his overriding mission in this case to protect America from terrorism. That
                    really was the engine motivating his extremely, how shall we say it, direct and
                    sometimes undiplomatic manner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, were you sort of the fly in the
                        ointment or something of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>HULL: Right. We were the ghost at the dinner. Bureaus, like NEA, would try to
                    manage us. Perhaps our best relationship oddly enough, was with SA, the South
                    Asia Bureau, which reflected Mike Sheehan's good relations with Rick Inderfurth.
                    They had worked together with Madeleine Albright previously. SA, I think, made a
                    legitimate effort to work with us in dealing with the Al Qaeda phenomenon.
                    Certainly, we didn't see eye to eye on everything and didn't have the same
                    priorities, but we had a good relation working relationship with them and we got
                    quite a bit accomplished. Both Inderfurth and his deputy, Al Easton, meant well
                    and were acting responsibly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it kind of in the back of your mind the negotiation
                        between the United States and maybe others to do something about the Taliban
                        and the Al Qaeda connection in Afghanistan? It seemed like a doable place
                        where nobody liked what was going on there and even indirectly or directly
                        we could probably hit them pretty hard without upsetting the apple cart or
                        was that a thought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It is very hard to deal with that issue because we all now view it knowing
                    what happened on September 11, 2001. At the time, the military force that could
                    be applied did not appear to be a solution. The cruise missile attack had not
                    accomplished very much. A full scale invasion was not in the cards. We didn't
                    have the support from the neighboring countries that we needed to do it. The
                    U.S. military had other priorities. Intermediate steps could have been taken
                    and, at the staff level OSD and JCS, there was some creative thinking,
                    especially by Brian Sheridan, assistant secretary of defense for Special
                    Operations and Low-intensity Conflict (SOLIC), but it never made it outside of
                    the Pentagon. The Joint Chiefs of Staff did not really see this as a military
                    issue, but more as a law enforcement issue even after the attack on the USS Cole
                    which was an attack on a U.S. military vessel.</p>
                <p>The “silver bullet” that did appear was the Predator drone, and we were flying it
                    over Afghanistan and identifying on one occasion what we thought was Bin Laden.
                    There were accelerated efforts to arm it so that it could be used not only to
                    identify targets, but then destroy targets in Afghanistan and elsewhere. That
                    was the crest of the U.S. effort in the period leading up to 9/11.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our view of the PLO, the Hezbollah, and the role
                        of Syria and Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>HULL: We differentiated the threats fairly clearly. We would identify, and we
                    would label terrorist organizations. We had a process, again mandated by
                    Congress, to do that, and we would do it on a yearly basis, designate different
                    groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). Although we had scores to
                    settle with Hezbollah, the Marine Corps barracks bombing in Beirut and others,
                    at this time Hezbollah was not targeting Americans. Therefore, we did not favor
                    going after Hezbollah in an aggressive, military or covert way and prompt that
                    organization to target Americans when it was not doing so. We differed in our
                    approach from that of the Bush administration post 9/11 which conflated threats
                    and dealt with terrorism generically rather than specifically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Iran again had a lot to answer for. Personally, I had been involved in the
                    Iran hostage crisis in the late '70s. Also, Iran had provided a lot of support
                    to those responsible for the bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. We knew
                    from the investigation that followed that Iran played a very significant role.
                    Subsequent to that, we were not aware of anything in particular that Iran was
                    doing vis-�-vis U.S. targets although clearly they were backing Hezbollah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we at all concerned the Pakistani support of the
                        mujaheddin or whatever you want to call them in Kashmir? They were getting
                        into India too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Yes. You had a situation where the Pakistanis were riding the tiger. They
                    had facilitated things for their own mujaheddin groups. During my time
                    Lashkar-e-Taiba had really come to the fore as the most significant threat, and
                    there was a very close relationship between these groups, which were focused on
                    Kashmir, and Al Qaeda which was focused on either Afghanistan or on U.S.
                    interests. The Pakistanis were really playing with fire. Pakistani military
                    intelligence was really in many ways the patron of the mujaheddin in
                    Afghanistan, certainly the patron of the Taliban and indirectly the patron of Al
                    Qaeda, so we had lots of problems with what the Pakistanis were doing.</p>

                        were you looking at the Saudi support for the fundamentalist schools with

                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were concerned about the Saudi role in that regard certainly the whole
                    diffusion of the Wahhabi school of Islam was a concern, but also the financing
                    that was coming out of Saudi Arabia, much of it from private Saudis, filling the
                    coffers of Al Qaeda's treasury and enabling Al Qaeda to operate worldwide.</p>

                    Interagency teams went to Saudi and Kuwait and elsewhere in the Gulf repeatedly
                    to work on this issue. It was very hard to get traction in the pre-9/11 period.
                    They had much more success post-9/11. In post-9/11, we saw the effects of those
                    efforts.</p>

                <p>HULL: We identified Asia as a growth area for Al Qaeda and its associated
                    organizations. The Philippines, Indonesia and our intelligence indicated that
                    there were more problems to come in this part of the world and from this part of
                    the world.</p>

                <p>HULL: Well, we weren't just reading the papers. The CIA was collecting
                    intelligence in a very concerted way. We were getting not only human
                    intelligence but signals intelligence. The FBI was following up and getting a
                    picture of Al Qaeda based on their investigation of the East Africa bombings and
                    other terrorist actions. We identified the threat, we knew Al Qaeda was growing
                    as a menace, we knew who was in charge of Al Qaeda, Bin Laden, Zawahiri and
                    others. We had a good strategic understanding of what the threat to the U.S.
                    was, including the threat to the homeland of the U.S. What we didn't have was
                    practical intelligence about when and where and who would strike next. The
                    closest we came was during the millennium period when a number of plots in
                    Jordan and elsewhere were disrupted, and we got through that period without a
                    successful terrorist attack. But, as was the case with Pearl Harbor, the signals
                    that were out there were just too many, too confused, too imprecise for anyone
                    to have put the picture together that would have depicted an Al Qaeda attack on
                    September 11 against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Al Qaeda achieved
                    tactical surprise in that regard and given the history of intelligence, I'm not
                    surprised that we were surprised.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling, and again this is all ex post
                        facto, while you were doing this the feeling that maybe the intelligence
                        community wasn't sharing as much as they should have? I'm thinking about
                        lookouts, as a former consular officer or passports. He's a bad guy and this
                        sort of thing? Did you get any feel for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, at the time I did not have it. In retrospective, the 9/11 Commission
                    Report has clearly indicated that there were disconnects and had the travels of
                    a number of the 9/11 terrorists been more effectively followed and handoffs made
                    between CIA and the FBI, there was a significant chance that they could have
                    been detained and the plot could have been disrupted. That's all out there in
                    the 9/11 report, and it's done a brilliant job of honestly portraying what was
                    done and what wasn't done. For most of us dealing with this day in and day out,
                    we were overwhelmed with information. We had hundreds of potential plots going
                    on. In the State Department in particular, we were primarily concerned with our
                    assets, our embassies, our personnel. We weren't looking at the homeland as much
                    as we were looking abroad.</p>
                <p>But I remember when Colin Powell took over, was designated secretary of state in
                    December of 2000, one of the first briefings he asked for was a briefing on
                    terrorism. I got the call from the transition team because I was acting director
                    for S/CT at the time. Mike Sheehan had left to go to the UN. We decided the most
                    effective thing we could do for Secretary Powell was to gather the CSG and so we
                    did that. We had Dick Clarke, we had Dale Watson, we had Cofer Black, Brian
                    Sheridan and, I believe, John Sattler and myself. Secretary-designate Powell
                    spent about two hours with us, and we laid out in unmistakable clarity the
                    threat we saw coming out of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>Cofer Black was probably most dramatic, which is not surprising given Cofer's
                    personality. Cofer said, “Mr. Secretary, we will be hit by Al Qaeda. They will
                    succeed in hitting us. I can't tell you when and I can't tell you where but that
                    I can tell you that for certain.”</p>
                <p>Colin Powell looked at him and he said, “Well, how do you know that? What's your
                    algorithm? How can you be so certain?” And Cofer said, “This is what I know from
                    my years in the CIA, working on terrorism. This is as certain as I can be.” And
                    he was absolutely right. I think Powell did not at all dismiss this. He took it
                    extremely seriously. We know he told Deputy Secretary Rich Armitage that one of
                    the first things he should have was a similar briefing on terrorism and that
                    Armitage should follow this issue personally and closely. At the start of the
                    Bush administration then, we had access to the secretary of state and to the
                    deputy secretary of state which we had never had in the previous administration.
                    Condi Rice got a somewhat similar briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was at the National Security Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Dick Clarke pulled together the CSG for her, not as lengthy, not as
                    pointed. Don Rumsfeld never got a briefing like this and on 9/11, he had not yet
                    replaced Brian Sheridan, the official responsible for terrorism in the
                    Department of Defense. The attorney general never got a similar briefing. The
                    people who were the most surprised about 9/11 were those heads of agencies which
                    is not availed themselves of the experts and had to a significant extent ignored
                    the problem in their first nine months in office. I believe Rumsfeld's recourse
                    to military force subsequently in Iraq and elsewhere was his compensation for
                    underestimating the threat initially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what did this sort of do to you and me and
                        others? Here you are carrying on foreign relations, which is essentially
                        dealing with the peaceful solution of problems. You have a bunch of really
                        nasty people out there trying to kill you but most people are ignoring us.
                        This must have been quite a burden just personally to bear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I think this experience was when I really personally transcended the State
                    Department and felt closer to the counterterrorism interagency group than I did
                    to State, and my priorities were more their priorities than they were State
                    priorities.</p>
                <p>We felt like prophets who were not given a hearing or were not taken as seriously
                    as we should have been, particularly, I think, with Secretary Albright. I recall
                    she was undertaking a trip to Central Asia. Central Asia was important. It was
                    Al Qaeda's backyard and an important front on the war on terror. Initially, she
                    did not even propose to take Mike Sheehan along with her. I was sitting in one
                    of the preparatory meetings, and Mike was not the kind of person who would force
                    himself on the secretary. I didn't have those personal compunctions, and I said
                    if the secretary doesn't take her counterterrorism adviser to Central Asia, no
                    one will understand in Central Asia. They gave Mike in a seat on the airplane,
                    but they downgraded the briefing materials on terrorism. They were much more
                    concerned about women's rights and issues like that. When the Secretary arrived
                    in Central Asia, all the heads of state wanted to talk about was terrorism. Mike
                    moved from the back of the plane up to the front of the plane, but it took
                    foreigners demanding Secretary Albright to talk about this issue seriously for
                    the secretary to put it high on her agenda.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Within State, it was frustrating. Tom Pickering was, in my mind, an exception on
                    the seventh floor. Tom Pickering was seized with terrorism. He was very much
                    affected by the bombings in East Africa in 1998. His door was always open to us.
                    One of the more significant of our diplomatic initiatives was to get UN Security
                    Council resolution 1333 passed which imposed a unilateral arms embargo on the
                    Taliban. It would not have happened without Pickering. Pickering was personally
                    engaged in the U.S.-Russian counterterrorism group that was very effective in
                    concerting our efforts with Russia in this area. Pickering personally convinced
                    the Russians to go along with us in imposing this arms embargo, and then did the
                    heavy lifting in terms of lobbying the Security Council. I think that was the
                    most significant diplomatic counterterrorism achievement of 2000, and it owed
                    very much to Tom Pickering's personal efforts.</p>
                <p>But once Powell, Armitage and Marc Grossman came on board, then really the doors
                    were open to us, and I could go to Rich Armitage on short notice with anything
                    on terrorism and so within the State system we felt very well connected indeed.
                    Incidentally, the new team understandably jettisoned almost all the former
                    administration's ad hoc diplomatic mechanisms, but they made an exception for
                    the U.S.-Russian CT group because they say it paid real dividende.g. UNSCR
                    1333.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from what you said that you were all waiting for
                        the shoe to drop and that Al Qaeda was going to do something which you
                        probably could have stopped.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. We were hoping that wasn't true, but we were expecting that it
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was one reason why as soon as the towers, the
                        International Trade Center and the Pentagon the immediate reaction from
                        people in the know said, “That's Al Qaeda.” It wasn't, “Who could have done
                        this?” or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was very quickly understood. The FBI, and this is recounted in both Dick
                    Clarke's book and in the report of the 9/11 Commission, the FBI very quickly
                    determined that some of the people on the planes had Al Qaeda associations and
                    therefore there was really no question of the authorship of the act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you left there in 2001?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>HULL: I left in July. One of the things when we briefed Secretary Powell in
                    December of 2000, one piece of advice that I had offered was that he should, as
                    a priority, select his man or woman for S/CT and get that individual confirmed
                    and up to speed. It was not a position he wanted vacant on his team. Secretary
                    Powell did that, and we got Air Force Brigadier General Frank Taylor, who
                    relieved me in June or July. By this time, I had been nominated as ambassador to
                    Yemen and was preparing for my confirmation hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Africa? Africa as a whole was this just a
                        convenient place or was there a seething problem in Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: What we saw was that Al Qaeda had a global reach. They could hit us
                    wherever we were vulnerable and therefore we didn't have the luxury of just
                    hardening embassies in Islamabad, for example, or hardening Embassy Riyadh. We
                    were in a worldwide struggle, and wherever we had vulnerability, our opponent
                    could identify it and could reach it. I think that was the lesson of East Africa
                    in 1998.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Latin America similarly we had regular reports of Al Qaeda being able to
                    function in Latin America. It never really reached a critical mass there but
                    they were present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see Al Qaeda as being very much not only a creature
                        of the Islamic world or were we seeing it branch beyond that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, I think Al Qaeda was sui generis. It was a terrorist organization
                    that had gone global and that had brought together in very effective ways global
                    financing, global communications, global logistics and that had made them a much
                    more potent adversary than the terrorist groups we had encountered prior to Al
                    Qaeda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were getting out of Europe because this is a time
                        when the European Muslim community was really developing and we see it today
                        where most of the activity in the Western world seems to be right in Western
                        Europe.</hi>

                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. Pre-9/11 that was not so obvious. I was responsible for most contacts
                    with the Europeans which took place in the context of annual G-8 meetings on
                    terrorism. In the wake of the '98 embassy bombings, we hosted a G-8 summit
                    meeting, I think in Colorado, and counterterrorism was at the top of the agenda.
                    The G-8 formed a counterterrorism working group. It fell to me to chair the U.S.
                    delegation to that group so we had meetings in Germany, in Rome, in Tokyo and
                    elsewhere. At the time, we had very effective relations with the Brits. So much
                    of our intelligence overlapped that it was easy to see eye to eye. The Germans
                    were supportive, the Italians relatively supportive, the Japanese were passive,
                    the French were obstructionist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often I've heard that in intelligence they're pretty
                        good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The French are good in intelligence. They did have their own very
                    significant terrorism problem, but Paris wanted all diplomacy to be run through
                    the Security Council so that France would have a veto. So any effort outside the
                    UN Security Council, any G-8 effort for example, France obstructed and we missed
                    opportunities because of that obstruction. We also had trouble with the EU. In
                    Brussels, we had at least annual counterterrorism meetings with them. We took
                    them seriously, the EU bureaucrats took them pro forma, and I remember we were
                    at times intentionally undiplomatic to make a point that we were serious. I
                    remember going to Brussels with the U.S. delegation and starting off the morning
                    with an array of EU bureaucrats on the other side of the table, maybe 15 or 20
                    people. Instead of going through the agenda in a pro forma way, we insisted on
                    absolutely detailed discussions particularly when it came to Afghanistan,
                    Pakistan and Al Qaeda. We took the meeting into the early afternoon almost
                    without a break at which stage our EU interlocutor said, “We seem to be missing
                    our lunch hour” and our response to that was we're quite happy to skip lunch
                    because we have so much material to get through, we might not have time for
                    lunch today, at which stage the EU delegation melted away and was reduced to
                    about two or three unfortunate souls who could not get out of the room.</p>
                <p>But the Europeans were not seized with the issue They did not take it seriously.
                    They were happy to talk about it as long as was comfortable and convenient. They
                    weren't ready to do anything about it.</p>
                <p>

                <p>Hall: We're in the transition period after I've left S/CT and getting ready for
                    Yemen. This is the summer of 2001 which is a very tense time in global
                    counterterrorism. There are continuing high levels of signals indicating that Al
                    Qaeda intends to do something. The interagency is meeting repeatedly trying to
                    identify what is going to happen. I've handed over the reins of S/CT to
                    Brigadier General Frank Taylor who was a U.S. Air Force general selected by
                    Colin Powell to take over the counterterrorism responsibilities. I'm in the
                    process of preparing myself for my next posting in Sana'a, Yemen. That posting
                    is clearly connected with my previous responsibilities in counterterrorism in
                    Washington since Yemen was one of the nodes of Al Qaeda's international network.
                    In fact, it was the location of their first terrorist attack against the United
                    States back in the early '90s when they targeted American military people in
                    Aden who were on their way to Somalia. Then much more dramatically in the year
                    2000, they successfully attacked the USS Cole, an attack which led to the deaths
                    of 17 Americans sailors. I think Secretary Powell and President Bush agreed with
                    the priority of the Clinton administration that the next envoy to Yemen should
                    have a strong counterterrorism background, and I got that assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Yemen from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, I should say a word about taking leave of Washington. Since I was
                    primarily preoccupied with counterterrorism, I realized that it would be
                    important to make the rounds in Washington; at Langley, with the FBI, the
                    National Security Council and DOD because counterterrorism can only be addressed
                    as interagency issue. And it so happened I was having my meetings in DOD on
                    September 11, and I was scheduled to meet Admiral Tim Keating who had been
                    assigned as commander of the Fifth Fleet which was based in the Gulf with
                    headquarters in Bahrain and since the Cole attack had involved a unit heading to
                    their destination and since there was an ongoing question of U.S. naval vessels
                    refueling in Aden, we set the meeting for that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I recall arriving at the Pentagon early in the morning and in the midst of going
                    through the security checks overhearing from a TV monitor that an aircraft had
                    flown into the World Trade Center in New York. My immediate thought was this was
                    an errant private aircraft, probably an accident, but something that would have
                    to be looked at very carefully given the World Trade Center's past status as a
                    target of Al Qaeda. Just as I cleared the security procedures in DOD at the
                    Pentagon, word of a second aircraft was being broadcast so I entered the meeting
                    with Admiral Keating with the thought in mind that Al Qaeda had definitely
                    undertaken a new operation in the U.S. We went ahead with the meeting
                    nevertheless and discussed the situation in Yemen, our future cooperation and
                    about 30 minutes into the meeting, we felt the impact of the Boeing 737 hitting
                    the Pentagon. It actually hit a section of the building which was right around
                    the corner from our meeting room where Admiral Keating would have been if not
                    for meeting me. So very shortly thereafter the corridors and the offices began
                    to fill with smoke from the fire, and the admiral's staff came and advised us
                    that the Pentagon was being evacuated because of the attack. We quickly shook
                    hands and agreed to meet in the Middle East, and then we were being ushered out
                    to the center of the Pentagon, the open courtyard,. I remember as we were
                    looking over our shoulders because we knew that there had been two airplanes
                    involved in the World Trade Center attack and we wondered whether there was
                    another airplane headed for the Pentagon. Perhaps the people in charge of the
                    security had similar concerns because we were immediately told to leave the
                    center area and to evacuate through the building to the south parking lot. When
                    we got there, we could look back and see the smoke rising from the Pentagon
                    where the impact had occurred and the scene was one of great confusion, great
                    concern because people had coworkers or in some cases, family that were
                    unaccounted for. Communications was hard. The cell phone network was completely
                    overwhelmed and inoperable. Private traffic was diverted away from the site. The
                    Metro trains had been stopped, the station was no longer functioning and it took
                    some time before we were eventually directed toward Metro buses with the
                    intention of taking us to the nearest underground stop. That proved to be
                    impossible. There was no way that we could get even close to Washington and as
                    the buses kept being diverted further and further west into Virginia, we got
                    word by transistor radio on the bus that the World Trade Centers had collapsed
                    and then for me anyway the full magnitude of the day's events hit
                    home.Eventually, we were so far west in Virginia that I asked the bus driver to
                    just let me off on Route 7, phoned my wife who in was in Falls Church packing
                    for departure for Yemen and she came back and picked me up and we spent the rest
                    of the day like many Americans following events on television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any doubt in your mind about Al Qaeda?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>HULL: No, I was virtually certain that this was an Al Qaeda operation because
                    number one, the target, the World Trade Center since Ramzi Yousef's attack early
                    in the Clinton administration had figured prominently in Al Qaeda's target list
                    and then the modus operandi, the multiple attacks either simultaneously or in
                    quick succession brought to mind the attacks in East Africa. Of course, the
                    summer had been a period of increased alert and we knew from intelligence that
                    Al Qaeda was planning a large operation so the responsibility was evident and
                    then of it was confirmed very quickly when the FBI identified several of the
                    passengers on board the aircraft as being members of Al Qaeda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought in your mind or people you talked to
                        right after that there was an Iraqi connection to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It would not have occurred to me that Al Qaeda was working with Iraq. We
                    had never focused on such a connection. I am aware in reading subsequent
                    accounts, Dick Clarke's book and the report of the 9/11 commission that some in
                    the White House and particularly the leadership of the Pentagon perceived such a
                    connection and wanted to demonstrate such a connection, but to those in the
                    counterterrorism world, that seemed to be barking up the wrong tree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this have any effect on your assignment to Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The most immediate effect was to raise a lot of questions about my swearing
                    in which was due to take place on September 17. I had personal issues because I
                    have a large family, 10 siblings, and my parents who had intended to come to
                    Washington for that event. So very quickly they had to decide whether or not
                    they were going to proceed to Washington, clearly a target of Al Qaeda
                    terrorism, or wave off. Their travel was greatly impeded by the grounding of all
                    civilian aircraft at least for the first few days after September 11. But in the
                    event 10 of the 11 did make it to Washington one way or the other. My parents
                    made it here, my wife's family made it and on September 17 the swearing in
                    proceeded with Secretary of State Colin Powell presiding. I've considered it
                    remarkable that the secretary of state with all of the burden that he was
                    shouldering at the time nevertheless thought it was especially important to
                    personally send off his ambassadors and for me anyway, the swearing in ceremony
                    was a very memorable event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're going off to Yemen. How would you describe Yemen's
                        political economic situation before you went out and sort of the situation
                        that you were going to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>HULL: Of course, the primary U.S. interest in Yemen was the interest of
                    counterterrorism, and Yemen had been identified by Al Qaeda as an important node
                    in their international network. Al Qaeda used Yemen not only as a base to launch
                    attacks in Yemen, e.g. the USS Cole attack, but also as a location to support
                    attacks elsewhere in the world, notably the East African attack. The linkages
                    also included linkages to the 9/11 attacks. In fact, one of the pieces of
                    evidence which linked Al Qaeda to 9/11 attacks was obtained in Yemen by a very
                    astute FBI agent who in questioning of people detained in Yemen related to the
                    Cole attack helped establish Al Qaeda's responsibility for 9/11.</p>
                <p>Yemen had been ruled by President Saleh for 25 years. Saleh had come to power as
                    a young colonel. No one had given him much chance of lasting. There had been a
                    number of coup d'�tat before his takeover and most expected those to continue,
                    but Saleh proved them wrong and proved to be a very wily politician who had
                    established control over a very difficult political situation. The difficulty
                    derives in part from a relatively weak central government and very strong tribes
                    especially in the north of the country. Saleh had, in addition, pulled off the
                    remarkable feat of uniting northern Yemen with southern Yemen and that had
                    happened in the early '90s in the wake of the demise of the Soviet Union when
                    the Marxists in Aden found themselves without a patron, with very few political
                    options and had agreed to unity with the North. That unity had been challenged
                    in the mid-90s when the south attempted to secede, but Saleh successfully
                    defeated that secession and kept the country unified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hall: That's part of the story. He relied in that on tribal support from the
                    north and also support from the mujaheddin, the Islamic fundamentalist fighters
                    who had fought in Afghanistan against the Soviets, Therefore, there were very
                    important and very significant links between the government in Sana'a and this
                    radical group. That was what was giving the FBI and the Naval Criminal
                    Investigation Service (NCIS) a great deal of concern in investigating the Cole
                    attack because the question was to what extent were government officials
                    complicit in the Al Qaeda attack against the USS Cole.</p>
                <p>Economically the Hunt Oil Company of Texas had a discovered modest amount of oil
                    in the Ma'rib area of Yemen. That's the northeast part of Yemen, and they had
                    constructed an oil pipeline across Yemen to a point on the Red Sea above
                    Hodeida. That was Yemen's economic lifeline. Some 90% of Yemen's hard currency
                    was derived from the sale of that oil. Otherwise, Yemen was the odd man out in
                    the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries had a great deal of
                    money and very little population therefore very high per capita income. Yemen
                    was the opposite. It had very little national income and a very large population
                    and therefore it was a country that was among the poorest and least developed in
                    the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out there, how stood relations with the
                        United States? Yemen is not supportive in the first Gulf War. It probably is
                        in opposition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Indeed. In the '90s, Yemen had a seat on the Security Council and was one
                    of the few countries that voted against the UN Security Council resolution
                    authorizing Operation Desert Storm. As a direct consequence of that, Jim Baker
                    had largely terminated our military and our economic assistance programs in
                    Yemen. Relations had gone into a deep freeze. Of course, with the attack on the
                    Cole and with the suspicion in the CIA, FBI and NCIS about possible official
                    complicity, relations were difficult, to say the least. There was much
                    speculation in the American media and in some circles in Washington that Yemen
                    should be a future target in the “War on Terror.” After we had dealt with
                    Afghanistan, Yemen was a prime candidate for future U.S. military
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your perception? Were you going out as a hatchet
                        man or a smoother over or what were you going to be doing? What was your
                        agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I had been to Yemen the previous year in my capacity as acting director for
                    counterterrorism, and I had on that occasion met President Saleh, Prime Minister
                    Iryani, the foreign minister, the interior minister, and some of the military. I
                    had also talked with Ambassador Bodine, at that time our ambassador there. I had
                    also been in touch with the FBI and NCIS ever since the Cole attack itself. So I
                    had a very good sense of how the investigation had occurred and the substantive
                    results of the investigation. It was a mixed picture. The FBI had gone into
                    Yemen and at that time the investigation was being led by John O'Neill, a
                    legendary figure in counterterrorism. The FBI had gone into Aden with the
                    expectation that they could operate as they had in East Africa, in Nairobi and
                    Dar es Salaam where they had been given a blank check by the governments and
                    really, pretty much a free hand. It was a very different situation in Yemen. Of
                    course, Arab and Islamic countries had a great sensitivity to American presence,
                    to American dictates and in this case of course, the government had connections
                    they were very sensitive. So they frankly had things to hide. The investigation
                    really preceded by fits and starts. Our ambassador, Barbara Bodine tried very,
                    very hard to press it, but John O'Neill wanted an even more confrontational
                    approach. That sparked a conflict of two very strong personalities, and
                    Ambassador Bodine eventually denied John O'Neill country clearance to pursue the
                    investigation, and the FBI had to send an alternate lead for the investigation.
                    That had surfaced in The Washington Post. Secretary Powell was not happy with
                    State Department and the FBI squabbling surfacing in the media, and one of my
                    objectives on arriving in Yemen was to get a team effort and a more productive
                    investigation.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The investigation had moved from Aden to Sana'a. While in Aden the FBI felt
                    itself as much a target as investigators and the level of paranoia was very high
                    indeed. They brought that attitude with them to Sana'a. They would not sleep in
                    hotels. They slept on the compound in a makeshift dormitory. They would go
                    outside the embassy compound only for investigation purposes and for as little
                    time as possible. There was a great deal of friction between the diplomatic
                    security elements who insisted on providing protection and the FBI which wanted
                    very much to protect itself by a much more overt show of force. One of my early
                    undertakings was to sit down with all involved and to hammer out arrangements so
                    the investigation could be pursued. In that regard I had a couple of advantages.
                    I had very good friends in the FBI from the interagency process, the
                    counterterrorism security group process, so I really came to Sana'a with a good
                    reputation. We were able to come to an understanding, and they knew clearly that
                    pursuing the investigation and getting results from the investigation was one of
                    the highest priorities that I had as ambassador.</p>
                <p>We were greatly assisted by the post-9/11 atmosphere because there was a great
                    deal of sympathy for the United States government. We received many expressions
                    of sympathy and condolences from ordinary Yemenis as well as official Yemenis
                    and so in that propitious environment we were able to press the investigation
                    and to get Yemeni cooperation in a number of ways, including handing over of
                    significant amounts of documents and other evidence that was even allowed to be
                    removed to Washington for processing by the FBI laboratories. So we're in a
                    situation where the investigation was showing very gratifying results and moods
                    brightened and cooperation within the embassy and between the embassy and the
                    Yemeni security organs was prospering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked with Mike Metrinko who was there before you got
                        there. The thing was scary because you had the State Department security
                        people, you had the FBI and he had I think the Navy investigators. All these
                        people had different views of the situation. They were running around,
                        driving on the sidewalks and they were sort of hostile to each other and
                        making a hell of a lot of enemies among just ordinary people. It was a
                        bureaucratic mess, and they were armed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Mike was talking about this situation in Aden. He had deployed to Aden and,
                    as I said, paranoia was added to legitimate threat. Yes, the situation was
                    teetering on the brink of being out of control, and there was a real mix of
                    people overreacting. Great damage being done. There was a lot of talent and high
                    motivation, but the trick was to bring it together in a team effort. Some of the
                    FBI investigators were among the best informed on Al Qaeda in the world. I'm
                    thinking of a number of Arab-Americans, who spoke fluent Arabic and had an
                    encyclopedic knowledge of Al Qaeda, at least as far as their cases were
                    concerned. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service also had thoroughly
                    professional people. Our station had some talented people, including
                    Arab-Americans. It was the ambassador's job to take all this talent and put it
                    together in a team so that people would feel comfortable with each other and
                    that we would show more results. That was our approach.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the investigation come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The investigation eventually lead to trials in Yemen and convictions of the
                    key Al Qaeda participants. In this regard, there's much to be said because in
                    between there were jail breaks and recaptures, and we'll get to some of that,
                    but the bottom line was the Yemenis eventually, with a great deal of help from
                    the FBI and NCIS were able to convict and sentence the perpetrators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this was the Al Qaeda operation also moving? Did
                        they have something in Africa too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Al Qaeda's main effort was directed against the embassy. They had links to
                    Eastern Africa but the most active plotting was to attack the embassy or failing
                    that, other American targets. We knew this from intelligence that we were
                    gathering through various means, intelligence that proved quite reliable, if
                    piecemeal. Initially, in 2001 and 2002 it was really a question of whether with
                    the cooperation of the Yemeni s, we would get Al Qaeda or whether Al Qaeda would
                    get us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How cooperative was the Yemeni government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Yemeni government in the aftermath of 9/11 said the right things. Saleh
                    had sent a private message to President Bush pledging support. Soon after I
                    arrived in a national holiday speech, Saleh had reiterated publicly that
                    support. But the whole question was whether or not they could convert that
                    rhetorical support into practical cooperation and show results. So we really
                    needed to do so, and we also needed to resolve this issue of whether in the “War
                    on Terror” Yemen was going to be a target of the United States or whether it was
                    going to be a partner of the United States. There was a great deal of
                    speculation in the Western media that it was going to be the former, which
                    caused the Yemenis great nervousness.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>I was asked about this early on at a town hall meeting held for American citizens
                    in Yemen, What you must know is there are about 30,000 American citizens in
                    Yemen, vast numbers of them and the vast majority of those are Yemeni-Americans
                    who came to the United States, many who were recruited by Henry Ford to man the
                    assembly lines in Detroit and then had returned to Yemeni with modest savings
                    and lived there comfortably. So we had a lot of constituents in that sense. At
                    an early meeting in my residence, I had a standing-room only crowd, primarily
                    Yemeni-Americans. The regional security officer at the time, Chance Rowe, was
                    made extremely nervous because most of them were wearing their “jambiyas”, their
                    ceremonial daggers, and he didn't know how wise it was to send his ambassador
                    into that kind of a meeting. But they were all very happy to be invited, they
                    were very curious about the new ambassador and one of their first questions was
                    whether Yemen was a target in the war on terror. I went out on a limb and
                    expressed my opinion that Yemen was a “partner” and not a “target” and that we
                    would get much better results through that partnership than otherwise. This was
                    reported, as I knew it would be, in the international media, and I never heard
                    any kind of rebuke from Washington, so at least at that stage I was going to get
                    enough slack to explore a counterterrorism partnership with the Yemeni
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Afghanistan the Taliban was giving refuge to Al Qaeda,
                        to the training camps and all that. Was there anything, what was he
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: That's an excellent point because in Yemen there were no fixed training
                    camps and U.S. military action would have been against very amorphous targets.
                    Not to say that there weren't identifiable targets, but it would've been a very
                    difficult and costly undertaking and when it was looked at, I think, that was
                    seen to be the case. We had from Saleh, both a private and the public pledges of
                    support so as ambassador my priority was to convert that into practical action.
                    When I made my initial call on the president to present my credentials I was
                    given an early opportunity to raise specific issues. Now normally presentation
                    of credentials are protocol affairs and no business takes place, but I had
                    decided we didn't have time for protocol and in scheduling the event President
                    Saleh also indicated to me that he would not be adverse to talking business. Not
                    only did I get the presentation opportunity very shortly after having arrived,
                    but he also re-jiggered the order of ambassadors to leave me the last ambassador
                    and therefore, to leave time after the ceremony for a substantive discussion. In
                    that discussion, I handed President Saleh a memorandum in which we detailed for
                    him two individuals who were playing leading roles in Al Qaeda in Yemen. One was
                    Abu Ali, who was really the godfather of Al Qaeda in Yemen, and the second was
                    Abu Assem, who was a Saudi and who was the primary financier for Al Qaeda
                    operations in Yemen. I asked the president for assistance in either capturing or
                    killing these specific individuals. We agreed that we would establish a special
                    channel to pursue this objective, and we were therefore launched as quickly as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>HULL: Well, a number of things happened. On the intelligence front, of course,
                    there was this defense vs. offense game going on. We knew Al Qaeda wanted to
                    attack the embassy or American targets and therefore we had to initially
                    strengthen our defenses. When I arrived, the embassy was shut down. The same
                    authorized departure that made it impossible for my wife to accompany me to
                    Yemen had caused most of the embassy operations to close and people were at
                    home. This over a long period debilitated our operations and so an initial
                    objective was to get the embassy more secure and get people back to work. The
                    regional security officer, Chance Rowe, had ideas and took me on a tour, showed
                    me upgrades that have been made by my predecessor and explained to me additional
                    things he wanted to do including closing off a grilled part of the front wall
                    and replacing it with a masonry structure to block views into the compound,
                    mounting barbed wire on the walls to prevent scaling them and a number of other
                    measures which I immediately gave the go-ahead to. My predecessor had been
                    reluctant because of concern that the embassy would become a fortress. I gave
                    priority to the security of the compound, but also because in Yemen because of
                    centuries of instability, individual homes, buildings were fortress-like. The
                    Yemenis took for granted that you would secure your place of residence against
                    attack by others so I didn't think we stood out in the Yemeni culture. In any
                    case, we fortified the embassy, and we also began very intense intelligence
                    gathering to try to figure out what Al Qaeda planned and counter that.</p>
                <p>We got the embassy back to work, but the authorized departure had sent home the
                    majority of people. We had no public diplomacy, we had no economic section. I
                    think at the time we had one political officer. We were really limping
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about consular? With so many Yemeni-Americans there,
                        this would be overwhelming for the consular officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We had a consular section, three officers as well as locally hired people,
                    and we got them functioning again because you're right. We had a very large
                    consular operation and an important one to a lot of Yemenis and to the Americans
                    who were still in Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to rely on or was there concern about the
                        Yemeni security forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>HULL: We had an interesting security situation. We had our local guard force, of
                    course. We had the Marine guard unit, and they were augmented by U.S. military
                    deployed TDY. The intelligence people and the FBI also had security
                    capabilities. Outside the compound, we had a guard force from the Central
                    Security Forces of the Ministry of Interior and we had also agents from the
                    Political Security Organization which was Yemen's equivalent of the CIA. They
                    were there not only to protect us, but also to keep track of embassy operations.
                    So we really relied upon the Central Security Forces under the Ministry of
                    Interior. In this regard, we were quite fortunate because Minister of Interior
                    Rashid al-Alimi proved to be a remarkably competent partner. The force itself
                    was under the command of, the president's nephew, and he too proved to be an
                    unusually conscientious and effective commander. So for our own security we had
                    two very good partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In spite of the situation there, the local tribesmen
                        continue to kidnap people. I mean there's an awful lot of ransom and all
                        that. Were these things going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were very concerned about kidnapping. When I was in charge of
                    counterterrorism at the State Department, on a number of occasions we had
                    incidents of kidnapping of foreigners in Yemen so I was very aware of the
                    problem. Usually these were not strictly speaking terrorist incidents.
                    Oftentimes, local tribesmen would have a grudge against the government. Perhaps
                    there would be family members detained, perhaps it would be lack of government
                    response to needs for services or roads or health. The tribes would take a
                    foreigner hostage, treat him or her well, but only release them when the
                    government made some concession. Of course, this was insidious because it led to
                    an attitude that this was harmless kidnapping and it was also kidnapping that
                    occurred with impunity because the tribesmen were rarely punished. The outside
                    world couldn't distinguish between tribal kidnapping and terrorist kidnapping so
                    Yemen's reputation was suffering and on occasion in the mid-90s, the kidnapping
                    had tipped into actual terrorists incidents. On one notable occasion, foreigners
                    were taken captive by terrorists who were demanding release of colleagues and
                    other political demands. In that incident, the Yemeni forces had actually
                    undertaken military action and two of the foreigners died. The situation was
                    unstable and detrimental to Yemen's reputation.</p>
                <p>Early on I undertook a concerted effort to stigmatize any kidnapping as terrorist
                    and spent quite a bit of time in my early days making the rounds of tribal
                    sheiks in Sana'a, meeting with them and arguing with them to speak out against
                    this practice of kidnapping with several sheiks actually doing that. Gradually,
                    the onus began to develop on anyone who kidnapped foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North Yemen tribal and southern Yemen more developed: is
                        that a good way of visualizing it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>HULL: There's a lot of truth in that. The south was quite different. They had a
                    different history, they had the British rule direct and indirect, and they had
                    the Marxist regime. Southerners were generally more sophisticated, better
                    educated than people in the north. The tribal structures in the south had been
                    attenuated whereas tribes were still robust in the north. So there was still in
                    many ways two Yemens. But Saleh had very cannily recruited a team of individuals
                    from the south into his government. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister
                    for example. At the time, Saleh had rather effectively papered over the
                    differences. He spent a great deal of time in the south, in Aden particularly
                    during the winter to send a number of signals; one, that he was president of all
                    of Yemen and two, he delighted in occupying the residence of the former British
                    High Commissioner to remind everyone that Yemen had succeeded in throwing off
                    the yoke of colonial rule. It was not a perfect situation but it was
                    functioning, and Saleh was attending to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations between the two neighbors, Oman and
                        Saudi Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The relations with both were improving. Historically, they had been very
                    tense, and Yemen have fought with both Oman and Saudi Arabia. The Sultan of Oman
                    had come to power in part by successfully resolving the Dhofar rebellion and
                    that's the part of Omar that borders Yemen. The Omanis were quite adept at
                    winning over the Yemenis subsequently by their diplomacy and the modest aid
                    program helping build, for example, roads. By my day, relations with the Omanis
                    were quite good.</p>
                <p>With Saudi Arabia of course, there was a great deal of tension up to the mid-'90s
                    when the Saudis were backing the secessionists in South Yemen in their civil war
                    against the North. But with the coming to power of Abdullah, as Crown Prince and
                    then eventually King a different tack was taken by the Saudis, and they
                    implemented a very astute diplomacy to make the Yemenis the good neighbor. That
                    had culminated in 2000 with the Treaty of Jeddah which had finally established
                    the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. When I arrived in Yemen in 2001, a
                    German company was in the process of actually demarcating that border that had
                    been agreed. In this instance Robert Frost's observation held true: good fences
                    make good neighbors. The Saudis were very active, very influential and in their
                    own way, very generous with the Yemenis, and the relationship was a good one.
                    That's not to say that there weren't very serious issues. The Saudis perceived
                    Yemen as a source of weapons, explosives, terrorists and drugs. The Yemenis
                    perceived the Saudis as a source of financing for Al Qaeda in Yemen. As you
                    recall, the chief financier in Yemen was Abu Assem al Mekki, a Saudi who was
                    drawing upon very deep Saudi pockets for Al Qaeda operations. So both sides had
                    issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bin Laden or someone in his family was very much involved
                        in the honey trade that was centered in Yemen. Was that anything at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>HULL: Not much. Yemen does produce the best honey in the world, especially in the
                    Hadramaut, which is bin Laden's ancestral homeland. The counterterrorism
                    community in Washington took a long look at the honey trade to see whether it
                    was a vehicle for terrorist financing. I remember I decided one day that I had
                    to get smarter about honey because there was talk in Washington of doing
                    something about this perceived problem. I went to a honey shop in Sana'a and got
                    a lecture from the owner who warned me that there was a great deal of deceit
                    that took place in the honey business and the main culprits were unscrupulous
                    dealers who would take inferior honey from the United States and mix it with the
                    superior honey from Yemen and sell it as pure Yemeni honey. I was advised to be
                    on the lookout for such crimes and given a number of practical tests for the
                    honey to make sure that it was unadulterated. In the end as far as I could tell,
                    counterfeit honey had as much or more claim to being a problem as honey
                    financing of terrorism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Iran and its influence? Was it a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was but I think we should leave that for the end of the discussion
                    because it comes to the fore in 2004.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get a public diplomacy operation
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: First, we had to get some cooperation going because public diplomacy is
                    rarely effective in the abstract. You really need the right policy and the right
                    programs and then you can convey them through public diplomacy.</p>
                <p>Al Qaeda was enjoying quasi sanctuaries in Ma'rib, Jowf and Shabwa. We needed to
                    be able to get into those areas to function there and to gain the support of the
                    tribes. President Saleh provided me an opening for this in my initial months in
                    Sana'a when he called me late one night, as was his habit to call you around
                    11:00 or midnight when he had something on his mind. He made a plea with me to
                    undertake economic assistance, development efforts in these deprived areas. This
                    was exactly what I was looking for, a presidential invitation for us to do
                    something in these difficult, remote areas. I did research on the tribes,
                    including using Paul Dresch's work, and it seemed to me that the problem was we
                    had a vicious circle in places like Ma'rib. You had bad governance which led to
                    an alienated population, which led to continuing violence, which led to
                    discouraging any kind of investment, which meant unemployment, which meant more
                    violence and fed into the government ignoring the area and back to bad
                    governance. What it seemed to me was we needed to replace that vicious circle
                    with a virtuous circle; improving the governance of the area, attracting
                    developmental investment, foreign investment, creating jobs, improving services,
                    strengthening governance and then around and around.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I came up with PowerPoint presentation. We did it in Arabic because generally we
                    functioned with most of the Yemeni ministries in Arabic. It was about an eight-
                    or nine- slide presentation. I needed some way to get it reality checked with
                    the president, and I chose for that his political adviser, Abdul Karim
                    Al-Iriani, who is perhaps the most brilliant man in Yemen, a former prime
                    minister and a former foreign minister. He came from a long line of
                    intellectuals and judges and was himself extremely well educated. He had a Ph.D.
                    from Yale, and was one of the few individuals who could deal with President
                    Saleh without personal fear. So I took my approach to Abdul Karim, explained
                    that this was my thinking generated by the president's request and asked him to
                    take a look at it and see if it was suitable.</p>
                <p>Now about this time another significant event occurred and that was I got a call
                    from Ryan Crocker in the NEA front office saying that there was a possibility of
                    President Saleh being invited to Washington. This was something that I pushed
                    for before leaving for Sana'a at the NSC with Zal Khalilzad, who was then senior
                    director for the Middle East and South Asia. It had turned out that there was an
                    opening in late November, and Saleh was being considered for that opening. The
                    problem was that it was during the month of Ramadan and in taking the dates to
                    President Saleh, I knew it would be extremely difficult for him to travel during
                    the month of fasting, but nevertheless, I raised them. As expected, Saleh noted
                    the problems it would cause for him, said he would be delighted to go but asked
                    if we could back it up to December. When I checked with Washington, not
                    surprisingly, December was not a viable time period. Between Thanksgiving and
                    Christmas there were short work weeks and a packed schedule so it was really
                    Ramadan or nothing. I so presented it to the president, and he accepted the
                    Ramadan timing.</p>
                <p>In conjunction with the visit then, Al Iriani had proposed that we also take a
                    look at some kind of memorandum of understanding on the issue of
                    counterterrorism whereby each side would lay out what it could do for the other
                    in the various areas of military cooperation, intelligence cooperation, and
                    economic development, etc. It was not meant to be a legally binding agreement or
                    a detailed enumeration, but rather to put down broad principles that could serve
                    as a basis. I agreed to take a crack at drafting such an agreement and after
                    doing so sent it back to Washington for its opinion and also made a copy
                    available to Al Iriani for him to take a look at.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>The following Friday I was on my way to the Yemeni Equestrian Club because I
                    often went horseback riding on Friday and got a phone call while in the car that
                    President Saleh wanted to see me urgently. I turned around, went back to the
                    embassy, changed from my from my riding gear, went to the president's office and
                    found an absolutely irate President Saleh who proceeded to take me to task for
                    the plan and for the “treaty” that I had proposed. It took me a little bit of
                    time before I realized what had happened. The documents that I given Al Iriani
                    for his private reaction had been sent on to the presidency and then the
                    presidency had sent them onto the Cabinet and they had caused a political
                    firestorm. I had never seen the president quite this irate before and I honestly
                    thought that my days in Sana'a were numbered and that I would be deemed persona
                    non grata in short order. President Saleh ranted for a considerable amount of
                    time. When he finally calmed down, I very quietly went through the origin of
                    both documents that the president had been generated by his request to me, that
                    the proposed memorandum of understanding had been Al Iriani's idea. If either or
                    both were objectionable, we could toss them in the wastebasket. I had no need
                    for them, but I was trying to meet a Yemeni request in both regards. That gave
                    Saleh pause and put it in a different light. He still said nothing good about
                    Plan Ma'rib, but he did say he wanted to think more about the memo of
                    understanding. Clearly, the problem with Plan Ma'rib was the starting point for
                    the vicious circle was that it was “bad governance”— a point that could be
                    argued easily by the fact that the governor of the province had been exiled from
                    Sana'a for keeping private prisons and his corruption, and he was well-known for
                    being a drunk. In any case, that was put aside and instead after some
                    consideration by the president, a green light was given to pursuing the
                    memorandum of understanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then did he make the trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>HULL: He made the trip. It was late November 2001 so two months after 9/11. I had
                    preceded him back to Washington and had hoped to find Washington focused on Plan
                    Ma'rib and the proposed memorandum of understanding. Indeed, there were
                    interagency meetings to discuss the memorandum of understanding, but I soon
                    realized that neither of these proposals stood any chance of serious
                    consideration. There was still a very strong camp in Washington that considered
                    Yemen a target rather than a partner in the war on terror and who were
                    interested in browbeating Yemenis or taking forceful measures. So the NSC
                    representative from the counterterrorism office in the interagency meeting on
                    the memorandum of understanding, John Craig, the former ambassador in Muscat,
                    effectively “deep-sixed” any talk of a positive engagement. I was left in the
                    delicate position of the president coming with no serious Washington engagement
                    on the memorandum. Saleh quite unintentionally provided me my exit strategy from
                    this embarrassment because on his arrival in Washington he called me over to the
                    hotel where he was staying and said that he had changed his mind on the
                    memorandum and that he was not prepared to sign it, but the foreign minister
                    could sign it. In response to which I said that was not the original
                    understanding, that we should put the memorandum of understanding aside and
                    focus the visit on the meetings and more general understandings. So quite
                    quickly of course, the whole issue of signing anything went away.</p>
                <p>Saleh went around Washington and met with all of the significant people in the
                    new administration: DCI Tenet, FBI Director Mueller, Secretary Powell, Secretary
                    Rumsfeld, Vice President Cheney and ultimately with President Bush. The meetings
                    were hit and miss. Saleh at times was good, but at other times really insisted
                    on talking about issues to which Yemen was marginal. For example, with Secretary
                    Powell he used the majority of the meeting talking about the Palestinian-Israeli
                    conflict, and we risked having the visit confirm in Washington's mind the image
                    of Saleh as an unreliable partner in the obsession which was Washington's at
                    that time quite naturally the war on terror. As we approached the Oval Office
                    meeting, I met with my colleagues in the Yemeni government, Ambassador al-Hajri
                    and Foreign Minister Qirbi and very candidly assessed that unless we focused
                    President Saleh on terrorism in the Oval Office and made sure that he and
                    President Bush had a meeting of minds, the visit would not be productive.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>I was also given the opportunity to pre-brief President Bush in the Oval Office.
                    We had about 15 minutes before the meeting. Secretary Powell was there,
                    Condoleezza Rice, and Bruce Riedel, the National Security Council director.
                    President Bush, when we walked into the Oval Office, got up from his desk, came
                    toward us and said, “Who is this guy and what do I want from him?” Secretary
                    Powell turned to his ambassador, and I had a chance to in about 45 seconds to
                    lay out what was involved in Yemen and what was involved with President Saleh
                    and encourage the president to be very direct, very clear about what we wanted
                    to mention specifically Al Qaeda's leadership Abu Ali and Abu Assem, and to
                    reach a partnership with President Saleh that together we would eliminate Al
                    Qaeda's basic operation in Yemen. That was an objective the president,
                    understood easily and could identify with. Bruce Riedel very helpfully chimed in
                    that President Bush would be well advised to pre-empt any discussion because in
                    President Saleh's past meeting with President Clinton, Saleh had begun and half
                    an hour had really been wasted with Saleh giving a long, meandering lecture to
                    President Clinton about Middle East politics. So armed with that President Bush
                    did seize the initiative and as soon as President Saleh was seated, laid out his
                    interest in the war on terror, that he wanted a partnership with Yemen but that
                    we needed to go after Al Qaeda and that Al Qaeda had faces and we needed to go
                    after the individuals.</p>
                <p>President Saleh responded vigorously, also very directly, said we are in pursuit
                    of these individuals, we will have them soon, “we will butcher them” which was
                    language that the Oval Office was not adverse to hearing at that stage in the
                    war on terror. So in the short space of some 35 or 40 minutes the two presidents
                    had reached a meeting of minds, and we left the Oval Office. As ambassador, I
                    thought I had a very good basis for pursuing my front on the war on terror.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you've got something you want done and you're mad at
                        somebody there's a tendency to look around for small countries, Jordan is
                        one, Yemen another but also the Africa countries who don't go along with us
                        and it's like showing that they're the problem. They really want to be tough
                        and they gang up on countries which have their own problems and all and the
                        policy types who want to prove that they're tough or something. It's a
                        phenomenon, it's a disturbing one but I guess it's a bureaucratic, natural
                        one. Did you find this and were you concerned about this in Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: It was very much the case, particularly in DOD and some people in the NSC.
                    There was almost a preference that Yemenis would be obstinate and give us an
                    excuse to take forceful action. Langley, however, was much more sophisticated
                    and all along preferred cooperation as did the FBI so as ambassador it was
                    really my job to manage these forces and to get enough of a result coming out of
                    a cooperative track so that those back in Washington who wanted forceful action
                    didn't have reason to pursue that.</p>

                        the counterterrorism business a preoccupation. You saw Al Qaeda as a problem
                        and all of a sudden the focus is moving toward Iraq. Were you sensing that
                        at the time? Was it of concern to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: At the time it still wasn't moving toward Iraq as the president had decided
                    that Afghanistan was the initial front on the war on terror.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. And I think he was well advised in that regard so we were still
                    dealing with the lead up to Operation Enduring Freedom and then Operation
                    Enduring Freedom itself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HULL: Right. The problem for Yemen was that there was a period between
                    Afghanistan and Iraq when there were no other active military fronts and that's
                    when some in Washington had a distinct preference for doing something forceful
                    somewhere else and that somewhere else could've been Yemen.</p>

                <p>HULL: Very true. And we came very close at times in Yemen to moving toward an
                    Afghanistan - like approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a sense, whatever you were doing, monitoring
                        from your connections back in Washington and all that you have a monster
                        that could be unleashed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>HULL: Yes. We knew that there was a school that wanted Yemen as a target, and we
                    were aware of ongoing planning in the Central Command. We also knew though that
                    Central Commander Tommy Franks did not want a Yemen front and therefore, we were
                    not without allies nor did George Tenet want to go out after Al Qaeda in Yemen
                    militarily. So it was a question of really showing enough results through a
                    partnership that would keep the hawks from gaining ascendancy and what really
                    helped us in this regard was an operation in the next month of December.</p>
                <p>You'll recall that President Saleh told President Bush that he was pursuing and
                    surrounding our two primary targets, Abu Ali and Abu Assem. In mid-December
                    Saleh called over and asked to see the chief of station. My response was that if
                    anyone was going to see the president, it would be the ambassador, and I felt
                    very strongly about this because I have seen in other places in the Middle East
                    where the chief of station had established a relationship directly with the head
                    of state and where the ambassador and the State Department were excluded and I
                    was not going to have that happen in Yemen. So I said there could be a meeting
                    but it would be with the ambassador. So he relented, we had a meeting in the
                    ministry of defense, unusually because they normally had it in the presidential
                    palace. Saleh told us that there was an operation being mounted to act against
                    our two identified targets. Abu Ali was in a good location just outside Marib.
                    Abu Asim was identified in Jowf to the north. He invited us to follow the
                    operations, and we wished him good luck and we proceeded to a very intense
                    couple of days as the Yemenis undertook this.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the Yemeni had very little surgical counterterrorism capability so
                    these operations turned into very clumsy, very noisy military operations
                    involving armored vehicles, mass movements of troops. It wasn't very surprising
                    that when they showed up at Abu Ali's compound on December 18 he was long gone.
                    They got permission from the tribes to check it and verified that he was no
                    longer there and that incident ended disappointingly, but not disastrously. The
                    operation in Jowf, however, was not so fortunate. There the Yemeni military
                    surrounded the compound and while they were negotiating with the tribesmen to
                    check it for Abu Assem, a Yemeni Air Force jet overflew the compound and broke
                    the sound barrier, which the tribesmen took to be the beginning of an assault
                    and therefore they opened up on the Yemeni military and killed 18. Of course,
                    the target was long gone so the operation had great casualties and was for
                    naught.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>We were depressed when we got this news back in the embassy and felt very bad
                    indeed for the Yemenis who had suffered losses and for the opportunities that
                    had been missed because this meant that in the future these targets would be
                    very hard to find. It was somewhat of a surprise to me then to learn that the
                    reaction in Washington was one of encouragement. We had notified Washington that
                    this was in train. They were following it very closely as well and the fact that
                    the Yemenis had spilled their own blood in pursuit of these terrorist targets
                    was a stronger argument for a potential partnership than any words that we could
                    have had and very interestingly, the reaction in Washington for the first time
                    was that we had serious prospects for working with government of Yemen against
                    Al Qaeda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this open up a relationship for training the
                        Yemenis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Well, things moved slowly. Washington was just beginning to wake up to the
                    possibilities that we had been presenting them for some months. The first
                    reaction of Washington was to dispatch Bill Burns, Assistant Secretary of State
                    for Near Eastern Affairs, to have a meeting with President Saleh. Bill was one
                    of the finest diplomats of his generation, an extraordinarily competent fellow,
                    someone who had the full trust of Secretary Powell, Deputy Secretary Armitage
                    and the respect of the National Security Council so we were absolutely delighted
                    that he was coming out. He came out the following January, and we set up a
                    meeting with President Saleh. Because it was winter, Saleh was in Aden, and Bill
                    arrived in Sana'a with the intent of getting briefed and then proceeding to Aden
                    for a meeting with the President. During the briefing for Bill, our defense
                    attach� very expertly laid out in a map briefing the operation on December 18,
                    what happened and why Yemeni forces were unable effectively to undertake this
                    counterterrorism operation because they only had capability of moving large
                    forces very slowly. What was needed was for us to engage with the Yemenis in
                    training counterterrorism forces that could operate agilely and effectively.</p>
                <p>Bill, of course, needed very little convincing. He had a good picture so we were
                    ready to proceed down to Aden for the meeting with president. Bill was on a
                    tight schedule. He had to meet with President Saleh and then he had meetings in
                    Riyadh with the Saudi princes that evening so he made a plea that his return
                    from Aden be in time to catch the commercial flight to Riyadh to keep those
                    meetings with the Saudis. To get down to Aden we were offered the presidential
                    helicopter, and we rode in it. Later we realized we were taking our lives in our
                    hands in doing so when a U.S. Air Force team evaluated the Yemeni helicopter
                    fleet and found it, including the presidential helicopter, to be unsafe in the
                    extreme. We didn't know this at the time so we climbed aboard. We arrived in
                    Aden, met with President Saleh.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>President Saleh again was at the top of his game, reiterated what he had said in
                    the Oval Office, said that the December 18 setback did not deter him. He was as
                    determined as ever to eliminate Al Qaeda and whatever the U.S. decided he was
                    going to pursue that objective. Bill had from President Saleh exactly what he
                    needed to take back to Washington. Unfortunately, Bill had now lost his
                    opportunity to catch the commercial flight to Riyadh from Sana'a and so we made
                    a plea to the presidential staff to somehow hold the airplane until Bill could
                    get back. In the event they didn't do that, but Saleh instead commandeered a
                    Yemeni Air 737, brought it to Aden, put Bill and his one staffer aboard along
                    with an entire lamb that had been prepared for their in-flight meal, and Bill
                    was sent off in style from Aden to be in time for his meeting with the Saudi
                    princes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there what happened with Al
                        Qaeda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Al Qaeda issue in the first installment played out over the next year
                    and it was on our part an attempt to gain actionable intelligence. Where were
                    the people we needed to get? And to also create a capability either on the part
                    of the Yemeni or aided by us to get them and at the same time to keep track of
                    what the Al Qaeda was trying to do against us so that we were weren't blown up
                    before we had our chance. Both sides of this were quite intense and involved a
                    great deal of first-rate intelligence work. After Bill's visit, Washington made
                    the policy decisions to engage with the Yemenis in a serious fashion and that
                    involved both a military track and an intelligence track. We started to get a
                    bit of economic assistance that we could use in the remote tribal areas. We
                    began to build the embassy back up, including the public diplomacy capability.
                    The central part of this was a training effort of the Yemeni Special Forces
                    which was their designated counterterrorism unit and this was commanded by Ahmed
                    Saleh, President Saleh's son. They had been trained by the Jordanians so we
                    weren't starting from scratch, and we had U.S. military trainers, both Marines
                    and Army Special Forces coming into Sana'a and working with the Yemeni special
                    operations forces.</p>
                <p>That turned out to be an extremely frustrating undertaking. The Yemenis were
                    still extraordinarily suspicious of us and when our people came in and the
                    equipment came in they insisted on vigorous inspections including of highly
                    sensitive equipment and they were very high tensions between the American
                    trainers and the Yemeni trainees because they suspected each had ulterior
                    motives. The situation became more even more complicated when the Yemenis
                    started to impede diplomatic pouches. We defined virtually anything as such,
                    anything we wanted to slap a sticker on saying “diplomatic pouch,” including
                    very large pallets of equipment, electronic or otherwise. The Yemenis defined
                    diplomatic pouches as the being orange bags in which things were put in. So we
                    had an extremely frustrating situation where the Yemeni would allow in weapons
                    intended for their forces, but equipment that we needed for our purposes would
                    be obstructed. We also had a problem in that the Yemeni Special Forces as it
                    became clearer and clearer that in effect, we were training a praetorian guard
                    for the president rather than an active counterterrorism unit.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>Fortunately, we had at the same time been working with the Central Security
                    Forces under Colonel Yahia al Saleh, the president's nephew, and Minister of
                    Interior Alimi. There we found a totally different picture. We found a great
                    deal of trust, we found commitment on the Yemeni side and we found a willingness
                    to engage in the terrorist fight. So although our efforts with the Special
                    Forces didn't pan out, our efforts with the Central Security Forces had very
                    good results. We were developing other options at the time over these months
                    because Washington was pressing to show results. The Afghan situation had gone
                    well over a matter of months. We were still in the planning stage for Iraq.
                    Washington wanted some other victory to show on the war on terror, and Yemen was
                    a candidate for that. And that's when we entered into discussions with President
                    Saleh about deploying the armed Predator as another option in going against the
                    Al Qaeda target, which lead, in November 2002 to a successful strike against Abu
                    Ali who was in a car heading back to Marib, and he was eliminated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there at all an option of Al Qaeda just to haul
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Al Qaeda had invested a great deal in Yemen and was not about to give up
                    that investment. They had in August of 2002, a plot well advanced to attack the
                    U.S. Embassy with rockets, and we were fortunate in that the rocket they were
                    preparing for the attack misfired killing one of the Al Qaeda operatives and
                    severely injuring a second one. It was that mistake by Al Qaeda in August that
                    short-circuited their plan. Then working with the Yemenis at the crime scene we
                    made the connection to Al Qaeda and regained the initiative so that the
                    following November we were able to eliminate the head of Al Qaeda by the strike
                    in Marib.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when in 2004?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: In July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time did you feel Al Qaeda was not much of a
                        presence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: After Al Qaeda lost its leadership, there began a long continuing campaign
                    to take out other key Al Qaeda operatives. Of course, while we were doing this
                    in Yemen, it was being done more generally in the Gulf, e.g. in the UAE. Bin
                    Laden lost his key operative for the peninsular region so between what we were
                    doing outside of Yemen and what we were doing inside of Yemen, Al Qaeda was
                    being steadily degraded. But they were not totally defanged. One of their
                    decisions in the aftermath of the successful operation against Abu Ali was to
                    mount an assassination attempt against the American ambassador, me. They had a
                    cell of very experienced operatives dedicated to that mission for the better
                    part of 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like for you under these circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We had a great deal of security. Our most important tactic was to be
                    unpredictable, to have no set pattern, to alter our routes, our times. I
                    remember I had a Monday evening bridge game. The Regional Security Officer came
                    to me and complained that it was entirely too predictable and so on occasion I
                    would spend Monday afternoon at the defense attach�'s apartment so I could make
                    my bridge game without making the transit predictably on Monday evening.</p>
                <p>The plot against me involved an attack against my motorcade and the plan was to
                    stake out two intersections to the right and to the left of the embassy because
                    when we came out of the embassy we had to either turn right or left and about a
                    block down the road in either direction there were intersections which the
                    attackers planned to stage at and then either using a rocket or a vehicle bomb
                    to attack my vehicle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they get close?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: They got to the stage of the surveillance and planning. Before they were
                    able to execute the attack the Central Security Forces, the minister of
                    interior, got information as to the location of the key plotter who was then set
                    to flight. They were never able to execute the attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it your family wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: My wife was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Hall: Amal was from the region, a Palestinian from Jerusalem. She was quite used
                    to dicey situations. She maintained good security practices and enjoyed her time
                    in Yemen very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the rest of the staff? The intent is aimed at
                        the ambassador, but you have other people going out all over the place who
                        don't have the same protection.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>HULL: It was an issue. We had a very street smart embassy in that we got a lot of
                    training from Diplomatic Security and other security forces. The one thing about
                    a tour in Yemen was that you became very practiced at personal security whether
                    it was checking your vehicle or avoiding crowds. But remember after the hit on
                    Abu Ali in 2001, pardon me, 2002 and then the subsequent degrading of the Al
                    Qaeda network, we steadily gained the initiative, and we steadily gained more
                    and more security for our personnel. So we were able to expand our operations
                    safely and there were no official Americans harmed during this entire period in
                    Yemen.</p>
                <p>We did have a serious plot by the Iraqi intelligence at the onset of the Iraq war
                    and what happened with that was that we were aware and forewarned from
                    Washington that the Iraqi intelligence service generally would respond to our
                    invasion of Iraq by trying to harm us elsewhere in the Middle East. We didn't
                    know that they intended to do it specifically in Yemen until my colleague, the
                    Italian ambassador, asked to see me one afternoon. He came over, said there was
                    a friend of their embassy who knew an individual who claimed knowledge of a
                    plot. We convinced the key individual to come into the embassy. We debriefed
                    him. His knowledge of the Iraqi intelligence service was quite accurate. He had
                    specifics for us: who was involved, where they were located, what kind of bombs
                    they had. We passed that information to the Yemeni Political Security
                    Organization, and at 2 a.m. in the morning they raided the house, arrested the
                    individuals and located three sophisticated explosive devices. They were not
                    going to be aimed at the embassy. It was too hard a target. But at the public
                    affairs officer and the defense attach�. So we had cause to be concerned,
                    especially with the Iraq war onset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the lead up to the Iraq war and then the Iraq war
                        play in Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>HULL: There were very strong feelings against U.S. action, and in the lead up
                    there were a number of peaceful demonstrations. The government was using the
                    peaceful demonstrations to allow people to let off steam. After the invasion of
                    Iraq, a demonstration was planned with the intent of similarly letting off steam
                    but it was quickly taken over by Yemeni Ba'ath Party members loyal to Saddam who
                    directed the demonstration to the vicinity of the embassy. We had within a block
                    of the embassy at the Sheridan Circle a large, a very large crowd of people, and
                    their intent was to approach the embassy and we did not know whether or not the
                    Yemeni security forces would hold. The embassy went to high alert. We had the
                    internal security plan going into effect. I remember walking around the embassy,
                    and there were Marines deployed there for training purposes who were loading
                    their automatic weapons. I thought we were coming very, very close to blood
                    being shed, possibly by Americans in defense of the embassy. The crowd turned
                    violent, there were shots fired from the crowd at the Yemeni security forces.
                    The Yemeni security forces returned fire, and I believe three demonstrators were
                    killed, including a young boy. The security forces never abandoned their
                    positions, and eventually the crowd, having been met with this resolute defense,
                    dispersed and the embassy was not attacked. We did not have to use force
                    ourselves to defend the embassy. The government then realized that it was too
                    dangerous to allow demonstrations to take place, certainly in the vicinity of
                    foreign embassies. They were banned. The Iraqi Ba'ath members who organized them
                    were detained, and we got assurances from Saleh that all necessary measures
                    would be taken to protect the embassy and Americans in Yemen and indeed during
                    that period, during the war no Americans were harmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were far from the scene but we're talking
                        about the period of Internet and e-mail and everything else. How did you
                        feel about the lead up to the Iraqi War because you had been very much
                        involved in terrorism aspect? I mean the rationale for going to war. How did
                        you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: I knew that one rationale that we relied upoi.e. the Iraqi connection to Al
                    Qaeda— had no foundation to it. The question of weapons of mass destruction was
                    a serious issue, it seemed to me. We had people deployed to Sana'a by the State
                    Department, health people, to give us vaccinations against smallpox for fear
                    that the Iraqis had that capability. But it was hard sitting so far away in
                    Sana'a to really appreciate what was going on in the inner councils in
                    Washington and on an issue about which we had very little to say. We did realize
                    early on that we were going to war with Iraq if only because the magnitude of
                    the deployments we were making could not be sustained for very long and that we
                    would have to use those troops once they were in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Yemenis make any protests or were you called upon
                        to get their support? Or what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>HULL: We were instructed to explain our rationales and to seek support. Saleh
                    warned us against going into Iraq. He was very consistent in this, but having
                    paid such a huge price for supporting Iraq in 1990 Saleh did not in this
                    instance go public in opposing our attack on Iraq but he did privately, very
                    consistently, and in retrospect very cogently outlined the risks of that
                    action.</p>
                <p>I might say just a word about two other subjects in terms of the broad
                    counterterrorism strategy that we were pursuing in Yemen. One was the economic
                    development part and the second was the public diplomacy part.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, our economic development effort was keyed on the remote
                    tribal areas where Al Qaeda had gained footholds, and as we proceeded on the
                    security side we also got enough resources to initiate programs there.
                    Ironically, the resources were not the traditional ones, the economic support
                    funds or others identified with foreign assistance, but rather from the
                    Department of Agriculture and the 401b program which involved providing excess
                    American agricultural commodities which were sold in Yemen and then these funds
                    were used. But we did have a rather substantial pot of money, tens of millions
                    of dollars. We found that by going out into the regions, it was rather easy to
                    identify cost-effective projects that had very demonstrable impact on the
                    quality of life of the tribesman. For example, in Medghil which was a village
                    about two thirds of the way from Sana'a to Marib for $250,000 we were able to
                    build a health clinic and then also arrange for training of health personnel and
                    equipment and medication that in the year after we finished it was treating
                    daily an average of 50 persons each day. The news of this facility spread
                    throughout the region and people would come from great distances. Relying really
                    upon our Foreign Service nationals, Yemenis working in the embassy, we were able
                    to replicate that throughout Marib and Jowf and make a significant impact on
                    health services. We also undertook a very ambitious project of equipping a large
                    regional hospital in Marib itself for some $7 million and created the first
                    sophisticated hospital in those remote tribal areas.</p>
                <p>We did work in agriculture as well and even some work in the cultural domain. For
                    each of these projects, we had our distinctive brand, a Cammariyyah
                    (moon-shaped) window which incorporated the flag of Yemen and the flag of the
                    United States so that our efforts became very broadly known throughout that
                    region, and we were credited as being the first foreign government to go into
                    those regions in an effective way and provide tangible benefits to the tribesmen
                    in those regions. I, myself, made maybe half a dozen trips to Marib and got into
                    the farthest reaches of Jowf where I don't think any American ambassador or
                    really any foreign diplomat had previously gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>On the public diplomacy side we found most effective to let the Yemenis take the
                    lead, and the Yemenis were very good at their own public diplomacy. The critical
                    element of this was to convince the Yemeni public that Al Qaeda was a threat not
                    only to the United States, but was a threat to Yemen itself. Al Qaeda really
                    made this easier in some of their targeting. For example, when they attacked the
                    French oil tanker which was carrying Yemeni crude in 2001, and it became clear
                    that Al Qaeda attacks were threatening Yemen's economic jugular and were having
                    practical, damaging effect on Yemenis, not only in general but specifically on
                    the fishermen in the area. The Yemeni government had some very sharp people
                    working on their public diplomacy. They told us they had seen what had happened
                    in the Washington area, the role of Washington residents in the apprehension of
                    the Beltway sniper, and that they were purposely intending to conduct their
                    public diplomacy to elicit the same kind of practical cooperation from the
                    Yemeni citizens and indeed, in a number of cases, that kind of practical
                    cooperation did lead to counterterrorism successes for the Yemenis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese doing anything because they had built
                        that road way back, and we were pretty nervous about that at one time back
                        in the Cold War era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: The Chinese were very ably represented in Sana'a by a diplomat who had
                    formally been the main interpreter, Arab interpreter, in Beijing, but the
                    Chinese were preoccupied with commercial interests. There was no greater
                    promoter of exports in the diplomatic corps than the Chinese ambassador whose
                    reason d'etre was to sell things Chinese in Yemen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: We were very actively pursuing the issue of democracy and human rights
                    which was another major effort of the administration. There was an election,
                    parliamentary elections scheduled for Yemen for 2003, coincidental with the
                    invasion of Iraq by the Americans. Saleh considered postponing those elections
                    but in the end went ahead with them. They were extremely well organized, the
                    National Democratic Institute, the UNDP, and IFIS played very important roles
                    with the Yemenis in organizing those elections. We were providing financial
                    assistance to that effort. We were working with all the parties in Yemen, the
                    ruling party, the Socialist party and the Islamic party. As the elections
                    approached, the Europeans became alarmed by the general instability in the area
                    and pulled out. The National Democratic Institute stayed the course and actually
                    brought an observer delegation of some 20 experts to watch the election. The
                    embassy, the American embassy, fielded an observer delegation of an equal
                    number, some 20 from across the embassy organized by a political officer who had
                    formerly worked for the National Democratic Institute, and the elections were a
                    significant success and a step forward for Yemen. Largely as a result of them,
                    Freedom House that year moved Yemen from the category of “not free” to “partly
                    free.”</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>The Yemenis subsequently sponsored a large conference in Sana'a co-sponsored by
                    the Europeans to which they invited both official and nonofficial
                    representatives from across the Arab world and it was a remarkable conference
                    that produced a Declaration of Sana'a putting these representatives formally on
                    record in promoting democracy in the Middle East. I had not taken it very
                    seriously. I thought the words had little significance without practical
                    implementation. Washington, at least the NSC, saw it in a different light. On a
                    subsequent visit to Washington with Foreign Minister Qirbi, we met with the
                    National Security Council leadership, with Steve Hadley, who was then deputy
                    national security adviser, and Elliott Abrams. For the first time in my tenure
                    as ambassador, the first subject raised by the NSC was not terrorism, but rather
                    it was democracy. They were aware of Yemen's elections, they were aware of the
                    Declaration of Sana'a and were very interested in using that declaration to
                    further promotion of democracy in the Middle East. Therefore, it was not a total
                    surprise when I received a phone call several months later from the National
                    Security Council wanting to invite President Saleh to the Sea Island Summit of
                    the G-8 which President Bush was hosting and which would have as its theme
                    promoting democracy. So, my tenure in Sana'a was really book ended by two visits
                    by President Saleh to the United States. The initial one in November, 2000 in
                    the wake of 9/11 and the last one, I believe it was in June, 2004 for him to
                    meet with administration officials in Washington and then attend the G-8 Summit
                    in Sea Island, Georgia. For Saleh that meeting, those meetings in Washington
                    were really somewhat of a victory lap because by that time Al Qaeda's operations
                    in Yemen had been virtually shut down. Our counterterrorism cooperation was
                    broadly speaking well established, and there was virtually no one left in
                    Washington who any longer debated the question of whether Yemen should be a
                    target or a partner. The partnership was really established on firm ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the democracy side, how strict was it with women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Women in Yemen were extremely impressive. They were some of the most
                    dynamic, most competent interlocutors and partners that we had. If you recall
                    during my confirmation hearing, Senator Wellstone urged me to attend to the
                    situation of Yemeni women, and I had done that. Therefore, we had a good many
                    projects with Yemeni women in training them, in the formation of NGOs and
                    political activities. I had also had the honor of working with the first Yemeni
                    ministers who were women, two women who were ministers of human rights. We had
                    an extremely fruitful cooperation with them. So we very much respected the role
                    of women in Yemen, we did our best to promote it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they secluded or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>HULL: In the cities, most went veiled and mostly Gulf-style veils, which had been
                    imported by Yemenis coming back from working in the Gulf. They were the dominant
                    garb now, not the traditional Yemeni veil. The women found ways of nevertheless,
                    being active, and I remember during the parliamentary election some of the most
                    active campaigners were women and more so for the Islamic party than for the
                    ruling party. They would go throughout the Medina, they would go into other
                    women's homes, they would have their discussions, they would do their
                    campaigning and largely as a result of this, the Islamic Party did very well
                    with the women's vote during the parliamentary election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Iran. What sort of role did Iran play?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Initially, Iran was not active, but towards the end of my tenure, during
                    the last month there was a rebellion in the north in the town of Sa'dah by a
                    group that had links to Iran. These were the Huthi party. Al Houthi was a tribal
                    leader who wanted to bring back the monarchy in Yemen. He was opposed to the
                    whole Republican experiment, and he gathered around himself in Sa'dah a group of
                    followers. He had traveled to Tehran, and he had gotten moral and probably
                    material support from the Iranians who saw in this group, a fellow Shia' whom
                    they could support. Ironically, of course, the dominant political actors in
                    Yemen were also Shia' (Zaidi) so it was not really a question of Sunni versus
                    Shiite, but Iran was looking to fish in troubled waters and find a party it
                    could support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in June of 2004. And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: July, 2004.</p>
                <p>The choice in front of me was between going to Princeton where I had been offered
                    a job by the University, not by the Department of State, but by the University
                    as the first diplomat in residence at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
                    International Affairs or going as a political adviser to either General Abizaid,
                    the central commander, or General Casey, who was in charge of our forces in
                    Iraq. I had decided that the opportunity at Princeton was too good to pass up,
                    and that I felt quite good about what we had accomplished in Yemen. I didn't
                    know what could be accomplished in Iraq and it seemed to me the time to close
                    the volume on the Foreign Service and to open up a new chapter in academia.
                    That's what I decided to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question. You, and we're speaking now our
                        involvement in Iraq continues and is highly debated and public opinion is
                        turning very much against it, so it appears. How did the Iraq involvement
                        play at an academic institution like Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>HULL: I had attended Princeton as an undergraduate in the late '60s and early
                    '70s and then the Vietnam War was a firestorm on campus to the extent that in
                    the spring of 1970 Princeton University and most universities in the U.S. went
                    on strike and suspended academic activity. It was quite a contrast for me
                    personally to be teaching undergraduates at Princeton in 2005 through 2007 and
                    realize the Iraq War was not really their concern. Virtually none of them was
                    being drafted. There was an interest, but it was an academic interest, and it
                    was not a focus of attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I think that's probably a good place to stop. Thank
                        you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HULL: Thank you.</p>
