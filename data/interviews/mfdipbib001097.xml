                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited due to the death of Mr. Sollenberger]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Howard E. Sollenberger. This is being done on behalf
                    of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>Could you tell me when and where you were born?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: North Manchester, Indiana, a little town in northerIndiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: 1917, April 28th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you've already passed your 80th birthday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I've passed my 80th birthday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes. They were both from a rural area in southern Ohio.
                    Grandfathers on both sides were farmers, and ministers in the local church,
                    Church of the Brethren, which is the religious background in which I come, mixed
                    with the Quakers and Mennonites.</p>
                <p>Q: That's a very strong, solid background, heavily rooted in the farming area.
                    What was it like growing up as a young lad in North Manchester?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, I didn't grow up in North Manchester. I was born there, I
                    grew up in China. My parents were missionaries to North China.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when you went out to China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Two years old. I don't remember [much of those earldays]. I came
                    back to North Manchester later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What spurred your parents to go as missionaries to
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I've often wondered that myself. They went to Chinin 1919, and in
                    those days that was not [unlike] going to the moon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but damn close.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Damn close to it, you're right. There seemed to have been a
                    movement at that time of American church people interested in spreading [the
                    word] and saving the world. They were a part of that movement. According to my
                    father, the impetus came from my mother, and he followed her rather than she
                    followed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They went to north China, Shaanxi Province, Taihang mountain area
                    which is really a rural and very poor area. My father, when they first started,
                    spent most of his time in road construction. There was a major famine in the
                    area at that time and, with the International Red Cross, [he] had undertaken a
                    work for food project and my father was assigned a section of road that he was
                    to supervise the building of for which relief food was handed out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Basically raising a family. At that time I had an older sister, but
                    both parents went out as missionaries. Part of her function was to try to
                    contact the local women in the area, and to do something with them which
                    ultimately would lead to their salvation.</p>
                <p>Q: I can see coming out of Indiana, not much Chinese is spoken there. How did
                    they prepare themselves? I assume you'd get this from stories when you were
                    older. How did they prepare themselves and how did they communicate?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I've been really amazed that the organization of the church that
                    sent missionaries overseas had the foresight to understand that language and
                    some knowledge of the culture was important. The first year that they were in
                    China, they went to the College of Chinese Studies in Beijing to learn the
                    language. They were ahead of the Foreign Service in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Foreign Service Chinese school at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No, not at that time. That came on later.</p>
                <p>Q: What was it like growing up as a young lad in northern China?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: For a long time I resented it. The expectation was that I would
                    come back, my home was in the United States, I was an American citizen, I would
                    go to college in the United States. And it seemed that growing up in China did
                    not particularly prepare me for the culture shock you ran into when you came
                    back to the United States. But there were lots of interesting things that
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what you remember? Did you have
                        Chinesfriends, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I did have Chinese friends. Being in quite a rural, mountainous
                    area, the contact with Chinese was probably greater than for those that grew up
                    in places like Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, [the major urban centers]. So, I did
                    have that contact, and I've always been amazed at how free my parents were in
                    letting me move around in that area. The earliest memory that I have is going
                    with my father when he was supervising road construction. I was left behind in a
                    room while he was out doing something, and I'd fallen asleep. When I woke up,
                    there was a strange man with a beard, something like you have. He turned out to
                    be a White Russian engineer that the Red Cross had hired for the purpose of road
                    construction, a civil engineer. I, of course, was young enough at that point to
                    not only be worried, but to start yelling for my parents. At which point he
                    brought out a nice big red apple, which was very nice.</p>
                <p>There were other missionary children in the area. I had contact with them. We
                    went through the usual childhood experiences of learning how to get along with
                    other kids, and in this case to get along in a different culture. We had Chinese
                    servants, and from the beginning I found learning Chinese easier than my parents
                    did. So in some circumstances, I had to be the interpreter for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q: There is a long oral history of John Stewart Service who grew up in some of
                    the same circumstances, but he was saying how his mother really kept him away
                    from Chinese. She was worried about catching disease, so he was really not as
                    fluent in Chinese as he later became because of this separation which often
                    happens with both Foreign Service and missionary families. But I take it this
                    was not so with you.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was a little different in our situation. In fact, I'm surprised
                    as I look back on this. For one thing, you could understand the nervousness of
                    parents with little kids. I think a recent study of missionaries and their
                    families overseas indicates that the fatality rate among missionaries is higher
                    than with any other group of people. Largely from disease, but not entirely,
                    because in those days as you know they didn't have all the wonder drugs, etc.,
                    that we have right now. I can remember within our small mission group a number
                    of the people that didn't make it. And yet my parents seemed to realize that we
                    were kids, we were in this [strange] culture, and that we ought to have some
                    contact with it. And we did. As a matter of fact, my parents did put me for a
                    short period of time in a traditional Chinese school, which was run by mission
                    people. I was [put with] other Chinese kids, I was the little foreign devil, and
                    had to defend myself on several occasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What Chinese were you learning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was Mandarin, northern Chinese but with a Shaanxdialect which is
                    rather strong and well understood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In later life did you have to unlearn that dialect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I've never fully unlearned it. As a matter of fact just within the
                    last month I returned from a sentimental journey to China, which took me back to
                    the same area where I grew up. And I had a chance to not only hear but to try to
                    practice, and I discovered that my Chinese has become a mixture of the standard
                    Beijing variety, but all too frequently with the tones of the Shaanxi dialect
                    which raises some eyebrows. But when I talked with the people in Shaanxi, they
                    thought I spoke Chinese better than they did because I spoke the higher social
                    level [vocabulary] that obviously had been picked up while I was serving in
                    Beijing.</p>
                <p>Q: You got out there in 1919 and were there during the '20s. I'm not familiar
                    with Chinese history at that point except to know that there was a lot of
                    turmoil and warlordism. Did that impact at all on you all?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It did, but Shaanxi Province was then under the governorship of Yan
                    Xishan, who was referred to frequently as a model governor. But nonetheless he
                    was a warlord, independent, printed his own currency, collected his own taxes,
                    built a narrow gauge railway into his capital so that these outside trains that
                    were on a different width of track could not freely move into his province. But
                    things were relatively under control, although Shaanxi Province has always been
                    considered a strategic province to the defense of the capital, Beijing and the
                    north China plain. So that on several occasions, we ran into military operations
                    in the area that, of course, to a child were exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any incidents of things that you recall during
                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I should perhaps mention here that foreigners in China at that time
                    had extraterritorial privileges, much like diplomatic privileges, where
                    foreigners were basically a law to themselves. They were not subject to domestic
                    law and control. It didn't take the kids long to realize this, and sometimes
                    would take advantage of it. There are several things as I look back on, I'm
                    ashamed of now, but it shows that kids will be kids wherever they are. I went to
                    boarding school for five years, eighth grade through high school at Tongzhou,
                    which is a suburb of Beijing now. [Editor's note: for another account of
                    Tongzhou School, from a student who also later joined the Foreign Service, see
                    Charles T. Cross, Born a Foreigner: A Memoir of the American Presence in Asia,
                    Rowman and Littlefield, 1999] We would have to go back and forth from home
                    during the summer vacation, and sometimes for Christmas. I remember one
                    Christmas trip that we made on the train, there were several of us missionary
                    kids, we'd purchased some of these concussion firecracker, things that you throw
                    down on a hard surface and they explode. Being poor, although we didn't know we
                    were poor at the time - missionary kids - we didn't have much money, we traveled
                    third class. And in this particular incident there was an old Chinese gentleman
                    that was stretched out on a bench across from two of us who were there, and we
                    had these little concussion bombs. He was asleep. We also had a lot of chewing
                    gum which apparently, as I heard the story, came to China from Wrigley's chewing
                    gum, who when they heard about the severe famine in north China decided it would
                    be a wonderful thing if they could get the Chinese hooked on chewing gum. At
                    that time they were talking about 300 million [people in northern China].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We still talk in the same terms. There's always those
                        million,or whatever number, potential Chinese customers out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, the Chinese didn't take to chewing gum at that time, but the
                    missionary kids got all the chewing gum their parents would let them chew. We
                    took some of this chewing gum and stuck these concussion crackers on the soles
                    of the old gentleman's feet while he was asleep. And you can imagine what
                    happened when he woke up. And yet a trick like this, I'm ashamed of right now in
                    terms of what I did and the reaction [we stimulated in the] other Chinese in the
                    train, [because we foreign kids did] something of this sort.</p>
                <p>On another occasion, we went through the train with punches and punched
                    everybody's ticket ahead of the conductor and got them all mixed up for him. And
                    yet he could do nothing about it, because we were foreign kids. So we had
                    experiences that I'm sometimes ashamed of as I look back on it.</p>
                <p>Q: I think we all do it. What about Chinese when you were in the school outside
                    Beijing, were you still getting Chinese, or was this pretty much a traditional
                    American education?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: A traditional American education to prepare us for college. We did
                    have a course, but it was Chinese as a foreign language. They did think that we
                    ought to be learning about Chinese, but there were no Chinese students in the
                    boarding school for foreigners. There were several Russian but it was basically
                    a segregated educational experience.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you experience, and you only realized it later, that there was almost
                    segregation between the foreign students, the missionaries, and the Chinese in
                    general... How did your family feel about this separation?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There was definitely segregation. The missionaries at that time,
                    and to some extent this was because of the Chinese insistence on it, built
                    little separate compounds. They built American-style structures, that's the only
                    kind of structure they understood and knew. It was difficult, particularly for
                    the women in these rural area to establish any sort of close relationship with
                    [Chinese] women. Partly this was because of the role and status of women at that
                    particular time. I remember one of the missionary women, who was there before we
                    were, talking about the way in which she was finally able to establish contact
                    with Chinese women. And that was through the death of one of her babies. At that
                    point the Chinese women expressed sympathy and came to her to express this. And
                    she often said it was through the death of one of her children that she was
                    finally able to make contact with the Chinese women.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>This was, in a sense, driven home to me later on when I was back as an adult and
                    was able on several occasions to see the mission establishments through the
                    Chinese eyes as something that was clearly foreign, clearly from the outside.
                    Something that from the Chinese point of view had a lot of money behind it.
                    Also, foreigners who had special privileges, or appeared to have special
                    privileges in China, before whom the Chinese had to, an expression they use, is
                    to kowtow, which means to lower your head and not look at the other person in
                    the eyes. So we had that separation, but my father was always uneasy, mother
                    also was always uneasy with that sort of relationship and did what they could
                    under the circumstances, as I look back on it now, to bridge that, not only for
                    themselves but for [us] kids.</p>
                <p>Q: While you at boarding school were there any winds of change coming around like
                    the Kuomintang or anything like that? Were you getting any reflections...</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...of what was going on in China? Oh, a good deal of that. As a
                    matter of fact there were several occasions where there were military threats to
                    the area. The major one being from the Japanese in 1935 as they made a feint
                    towards north China. They didn't actually invade until '37 but large troop
                    movements in the area, Tongzhou was considered the east gate to Beijing so there
                    were concentrations of troops there. That created a good deal of excitement, and
                    also created some interesting school experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, the major one had to do with a group of boys, there were five
                    of us that roomed together in the same room. With troops [arriving], we wanted
                    to go down to the railroad station and look at this. We were under strict orders
                    not to do so. The headmaster of the school was a Danish gentleman who believed
                    in the old discipline of the Danish navy, he'd been in the Danish navy, and
                    applied that liberally to the students. On this particular occasion, after being
                    denied the privilege of going down to the railway station, we decided we'd go
                    into the city. The gates were locked to the city at that time and we had to
                    climb over the city wall, which we did, [we were young] and had scouted out the
                    area well before hand. And found getting into town rather interesting under
                    these circumstances. We did it three times. And one of the roommates had a
                    girlfriend, she found out about it through him. The matron found out about it
                    through the girlfriend, or through gossip in the girl's dorm, and the headmaster
                    found out about it. The result was that, since we'd gone in three times, we had
                    to be punished three times. His pattern was, you'd be invited into [his]
                    interchamber, he had a drawer in the dresser, the lower drawer, and he had a
                    variety of instruments there, bamboo canes, hair brushes, straps, and generally
                    you were given the option of choosing the one that you wanted. But after three
                    nights of this we began to get a little sore on the behind, took pillows to
                    school with us to sit on, and the parents finally decided that was a little too
                    much. The gentleman did not stay with the school. But that's school life for
                    you.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I went back to North Manchester. I had free tuitiothere. It was a
                    church college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Manchester College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Manchester College from '35 to '38.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: [Yes], at which time I dropped out. And the reason for dropping out
                    basically was that it seemed to me that the kids in college at that time were
                    much too focused on their own problems, and were not aware that the world was on
                    fire. From my point of view the world was on fire. In '38 the Japanese had
                    invaded north China and the word that I got back from north China was that [the
                    Japanese] had [implemented a] scorched earth [policy] in much of the area where
                    I grew up. And, of course, things had happened in north Africa and began to
                    happened in Europe. I just felt it didn't make sense to sit in school at that
                    particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're about 21 at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: So I tried to find a way to get back to China to sewhat I could do
                    to help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Manchester College what were you
                        studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: History and political science. I was fortunate in my education to
                    be with Andrew Cordier, who was the history professor at that time. He later
                    became the Under Secretary for the United Nations, and [acting] president of
                    Columbia University (1969-1970), [and dean of faculty at Columbia's School of
                    International Affairs]. I was his assistant for a couple of years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's really amazing to find that in a small school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. My education was really from him, as I look back on
                    it. I found a way to get back to China in relief work for both the Church of the
                    Brethren and the Quakers, sort of a joint emergency project. I wanted to go back
                    to an area that I knew, and [I made it]. I spent from the end of '38 to 1940 in
                    emergency relief work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your parents still in China during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: My father was there part of the time. My mother wanot, her health
                    was such that she remained in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got back in 1938. Where did you go and can you
                        describe hoyou saw the situation where you were at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I went back to the Taihang mountain area. I went to the city where
                    I had spent the years when I was in high school, that was the home base. The
                    area had already been invaded once by the Japanese who had gone through in an
                    effort to weed out, or to destroy the guerrilla base. Of particular interest in
                    that area was the fact that this was area that was under the control, at that
                    time, of the Eighth Route Army, the communist Eighth Route Army. It was not too
                    long after their long march, and they had moved across into Shaanxi, and set up
                    a military base in the Taihang mountain area, and were attempting to operate
                    against the Japanese. The city that I'd set up base in was not destroyed by the
                    [Japanese] scorched earth [policy]. But the villages around and all the way back
                    up to the northern area, Yangchuan, had been pretty well wiped out. The refugees
                    when I got there, the end of '38, were drifting back into the cities. But the
                    problem there was an emergency problem in how to deal with their homes in the
                    rural areas. The Eighth Route Army at that time was not engaging very often with
                    the Japanese, they were being very selective. But they had had several
                    significant engagements in areas not far from where we were. In one of these,
                    [the Japanese] suffered rather severely when they were waylaid in a mountain
                    pass by the Eighth Route Army, and they retaliated by literally destroying two
                    county seats, two walled cities. [it was] in this area we concentrated on trying
                    to do something with the refugees, a drop in the bucket considering the
                    problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: How were you treated, both by the Japanese and by the Chinese communists,
                    during this period? Here you were where the line was moving back and forth?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was not only the communists. Yan Xishan was still in the
                    province as the military warlord. He had a deputy who was in charge of southeast
                    Shaanxi which is where we were operating. We had contact with him. We had to
                    because he had authority over all of the magistrates in the area, and relations
                    with him and with [him and] the local governments was very good. I mean, they
                    saw rather quickly that there was an advantage in having some foreign assistance
                    in dealing with the problems that they had. As it turned out the deputy
                    governor, Bo Yibo, was really an under cover communist at the time, and at the
                    appropriate moment in 1939 he turned over, and turned over with the provincial
                    troops that were under his command, turned over to the communists. He was later
                    rewarded, became, I think, Minister of Finance under the communist regime, and
                    is now probably the oldest senior communist still living in the Beijing area. I
                    had direct contact with him because of the work that I was doing at that time.
                    To begin with, [we had] only minor contact with the Eighth Route Army. I did
                    have to get permission passes from them, [but] there were no problems in getting
                    those. They again, I guess, saw the value of [our work], and at that time they
                    were treating the local people with kid gloves. They realized they couldn't
                    survive in the mountains without at least the tacit approval, if not the help,
                    of the local population. And by contrast the way in which they were treating the
                    people at that time was so much better than the way in which the government
                    troops were treating the people, that they pretty well got the cooperation that
                    they were looking for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into the Japanese at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes. While I was out on one of my relief trips in the mountains
                    taking care of refugees, the city where I was stationed was occupied. I
                    eventually had to go back into the city. They were obviously not pleased, made
                    it clear that if I was going to stay in the area, I had to stay in the city. But
                    basically they would prefer [that] I should leave. And it eventually became
                    clear that I should leave, so I left, but came back again through the back door,
                    going back into free China, trekking up through the Taihang mountains from the
                    Yellow River, back to near the city that was still under occupation by the
                    Japanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>At that time I had some interesting contact with the communist army. On one
                    occasion trying to get through the Japanese lines, I ran into a group of
                    students that were coming from [the] Beijing-Tianjin area coming back to the
                    mountains in Shaanxi to get into a school. And the communists were running some
                    open air schools literally on the mountain side, in the little villages. It was
                    interesting that they gave a high priority to education. There were about 300
                    students of them, as the students were coming through the Japanese lines from
                    the other side, they had alerted the Japanese somehow, and all hell broke loose.
                    It was obvious that I couldn't go through at that particular point. But we met
                    some of the students as they came through. Their Chinese guides had gotten
                    scared and run off and left them. They were in a strange area and didn't know
                    where they were at night. I knew the area and knew it fairly well, I trekked
                    over it, had hunted there as a kid. So I started back with them and we ran into
                    some of the Eighth Route Army people who were coming down to see what the chaos
                    was, and they took over and took me and the students back to headquarters. It
                    turned out to be the central headquarters of the Eighth Route Army General Peng
                    Dehuai, who was then the commander of the Eighth Route. I spent three days at
                    headquarters basically getting acquainted, and they getting acquainted with me
                    and finding out what I was doing. Among other things I spent one evening playing
                    chess with the general, Chinese chess which I had learned as a kid, and since I
                    could speak Chinese it was interesting to be able to sit down with him, doing
                    something from his culture. As it turned out I could do almost as well as he
                    could, and speak Chinese. Among other things I wanted to get from him his story
                    of the Long March. How he became and why he became a communist. What his view of
                    the world was at that particular point. It was a rare opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears about the discipline of the Chinese communist
                        troops. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...as contrasted to the government type.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. When I came back from the back door on that trip, I
                    had to come through an area that was under Nationalist control, where the
                    Nationalists had placed one of their most dependable generals and military
                    units, a pretty large one, north of the Yellow River, both to block the
                    communists from expanding south, but also to deal with the Japanese. As it
                    turned out, this was 1939, this was the beginning of the breakdown of the United
                    Front that [the Nationalists and Communists] had worked out to fight the
                    Japanese. There was, in fact, going on minor scrimmages there on a three-way
                    front, Japanese versus communist, the Nationalist versus Japanese and communist.
                    A very mixed up situation. I ran into that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What exactly were you doing, and where was your support
                        cominfrom?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The support was basically in money. The supplies had to be somehow
                    [transported into] the area. At the beginning, with money, you could buy grain
                    millet which was the stable in that area. And you could distribute it either
                    through work projects, or directly. And because of the emergency nature much of
                    it had to be direct. Clothing was another problem. [During] wintertime, [when it
                    was] cold in the mountain area, the Chinese wore padded garments. The normal
                    commerce did not bring either cotton or clothe in. One of the things that we did
                    was to send refugees from the mountain area into the north China plain with
                    currency to buy both millet and cotton, and to bring it back. The cotton could
                    be used in home industry, women knew how to spin, weave, make clothe. The
                    arrangement there was that by issuing a certain amount of cotton, say to a woman
                    and her daughters-in-law, whoever were about, that by turning this into clothe
                    they would get a certain percentage of this, and the rest of it would come back
                    to us which we would hand out to people who needed it. Part of it was a
                    psychological thing of getting the people back into their villages, even to
                    build lean-to for temporary shelter from the ruins that the Japanese had left.
                    You could do that by issuing grain back then. In other words, it's not hopeless,
                    cooperatively you could get together and do something. But again, it was so
                    frustrating because you'd get it done and the Japanese would come through again.
                    I spent two years, probably the most interesting, and in some respects the best
                    two years of my life.</p>
                <p>Q: Here you were trying to build up villages while the Japanese were trying to
                    destroy them. I would have thought they would have taken a very dim view of what
                    you were doing.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They did. That's why I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't arrest you at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No, they didn't arrest me. Well, let's back up a little bit. There
                    were risks involved there. We were well aware of these. In another town along
                    the railway which was 100 miles from here, three of the missionaries of this
                    domination, Church of the Brethren, disappeared during the Japanese occupation,
                    and all the evidence pointed towards the Japanese. We were all aware of this,
                    and that we had to be cautious. We wanted to be cautious also because we didn't
                    want the Chinese that were associated with us to be punished by the Japanese.
                    So, it became clear that I couldn't deal with the refugees in the mountains, I
                    couldn't go back and forth in other words, or I would have been arrested. I
                    decided to leave but to come in by the back door.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>On my recent trip back to China I went to the same town, the same city, and I met
                    with an elderly woman who after we had left, probably a couple years after we
                    had left, both her husband, her husband's brother and a third person had been,
                    for some reason, selected by the Japanese to be examples of what happens to
                    people that they suspected of whatever. Whether it was being suspected of
                    communist affiliation, or because of their contact with the foreigners. But
                    these three people had been publicly bayoneted in a demonstration to the
                    populous, a public demonstration of what happens. That sort of thing happened.
                    I've also felt very guilty and I expressed my feeling about that. When I met
                    with them this time, with some of the children, it was interesting that they
                    said it probably would have happened anyhow, and they seemed to hold no feeling
                    or grudge about it. In fact, we were welcomed, we were warmly welcomed by them.
                    One thing the children wanted to know what [was the wartime] situation [like].
                    The old lady wouldn't talk about it, and had never told them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did money get to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, two ways. One way was to take a trip out to Beijing and
                    Tianjin and bring it back. The other way when I came in the back door,
                    arrangements had been made to the Quakers in Shanghai to send money to Xian, to
                    a mission group in Xian, where I picked it up and then carried it into the
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other people you were working with? Were
                        therother groups, or was this pretty much an American missionary group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This was strictly American. My father and two other missionaries were also
                    involved in doing relief work, but they were basically there as missionaries. I
                    was there strictly on a relief assignment. When I came back through the back
                    door I brought with me a young Quaker, Lewy-Whitaker, then teaching in the
                    Peking American school and when he learned what I was doing and decided that
                    would be more interesting and joined me. He did not make it. When we were
                    crossing the Yellow River coming in, both of us had contracted typhus. We
                    recovered from that and then made the effort again and I made it back up [to
                    where I was before]. But later he, because of the weakness I guess from typhus,
                    he got typhoid fever, and died in Chendu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Catholic missionaries, and other
                        groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, there were a few that were there. But so far as I know, in the
                    area where I was working, we were the only [foreign] group. [You know that the
                    missionary groups] had divided up [China into exclusive] territories.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you came back was Kuomintang the government at
                        thatime?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There was a new government. In 1940 was the government and I think
                    everybody recognized that it was the end of the Nationalist and probably Chiang
                    Kai-shek. That they could effectively mount any sort of resistance against the
                    Japanese on a nationwide basis. I think that's basically why when he was
                    kidnaped in Xian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the young marshall, Jiang Xueliang.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. Apparently was one of his, or at least allied with
                    him and I believe he was released and according to the information that I had,
                    at least because of the communist insistence that he be released, and their
                    willingness to join the United Front providing he would stop the civil war and
                    focus on fighting Japan. At least that's the story I got from Marshal Peng
                    Dehuai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1940, how did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, one, I wasn't well, and two, it became apparent [that] what I
                    had been doing in that area, I could no longer do. So I'd spent two years and
                    decided that I should come back and complete my education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Evacuation boat at that time out of Shanghai, that took me down
                    through Australia, New Zealand, and back home. There appeared to be enough
                    nervousness at that point about what was happening in the Pacific, even though
                    we were not yet at war with Japan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I would, very definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you by any chance run across anybody in the American

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I did when I got back to Chungking on my way out. I stopped in at
                    the embassy. It was at that time located there, and gave them a report on what
                    was happening up in Shaanxi with the so-called United Front. They had heard
                    rumors of that, but had no direct reports from observers [actually in] the
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel from the embassy at that time, what
                        was thinterest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Only in a marginal sort of way. I did get the feeling that there
                    was some exasperation in the way in which the Chinese were, [meaning the
                    Generalissimo], in conducting the war, and was not getting the cooperation that
                    they had hoped. And there was interest also in whether the communist would be a
                    reliable temporary ally in dealing with the Japanese, and what the prospects
                    were [the KMT-CCP] getting together. I could not be very encouraging about that
                    from what I'd seen. It wasn't going to work for reasons on both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any recollection of who talked to you

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: One of the people I talked to was Drummond. Therwere a couple of
                    people that I talked with, but I've forgotten.</p>
                <p>Q: Where did you go when you took this circuitous route down to Shanghai to
                    Australia, to New Zealand, and back to the States? Where did you go?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: You mean when I came back?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I came back to Manchester to see if they would reinvent me to
                    finish my education, undergraduate education. At that point I felt rather,
                    what's the word I'm trying to think of...rather frustrated, at the slowness of
                    the educational process. I tried to work out a deal with my professors whereby
                    if I could pass their final examinations, I wouldn't have to sit through all the
                    classes, I could compress within one semester a year's work. I felt I could do
                    it. Cordier said okay, but some of the other professors felt this would be
                    setting a precedent that they could not live with. But I did manage to finish up
                    [in 1941].</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, the draft came along, and with the background that I had with
                    the Brethren, Mennonites, Quakers, the three historic [peace churches], my
                    feeling at that time was that I could not participate in warfare, and this was
                    sort of re-established by what I had observed going on as a result of war in
                    northern Shaanxi. So I took an alternative, I complied with the draft, and was
                    assigned to alternative service under the draft. I was four years in alternative
                    service in projects in the United States, [Puerto Rico, and] South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say alternative work, what did this consist
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Almost anything you can think of, depending on what you could agree
                    on as meaningful. It involved conservation work on the farms, environmental
                    cleanup projects, it involved establishing a rural hospital in Puerto Rico. It
                    involved working in hospital wards. And the reason for South Africa on this was
                    that I was determined to try to get back to China to work in that situation. I
                    was trying to join the Friends Ambulance Unit, it was a British operation,
                    operating in China and got as far as South Africa. There were six of us at that
                    time en route [to China] with the war [still] on. [Our route was to go around
                    the Cape to India and up the Burma Road into China.] We got as far as South
                    Africa and an Act of Congress turned us back and I spent about six months in
                    South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Act of Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Basically, that people not in military uniform coulnot go overseas.
                    That was the result basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation that you saw in South Africa? This
                        woulbe '43 or '44. It was not an official policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: [Yes, in 1943, we saw apartheid even though it wasn't an official
                    policy.] I volunteered while I was there waiting for transportation, first to go
                    over to China, and then coming back and had to return. I volunteered to work in
                    a hospital basically set up for the blacks in Durban. So I had a direct
                    experience with observing the practical [application of] apartheid.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the hand of the British administration pretty heavy

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, I had a good deal of contact with them in the hospital, and
                    only on one occasion did I have social contact outside. That was through a
                    special incident, I guess. They assigned me to the emergency room, and one day a
                    Zulu warrior came in, and his ear was almost cut off. He'd been in a fight; it
                    was dangling down. And the European doctor who was in charge, said, take it off.
                    And I said, isn't it possible that this could be put on? Yes, he said, it is but
                    this is a black and minus an ear is not worth the bother, just cut it off, it's
                    much easier that way. I said, would you mind if I tried to put it on? He said,
                    go ahead. I very carefully stitched his ear back on. He came back several times
                    to get it dressed, etc., and it stuck. But he then invited me to his home and
                    his wife gave me some beads. So I had that one memorable social contact. But
                    otherwise it was just [seeing people in] one of the wards, and a few of the
                    Africans and some of the Asians, the Indian doctors were in the hospital.</p>

                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I left the alternative service, civilian public service, and was
                    immediately recruited by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
                    Administration, UNRRA. They were in the process here in Washington of getting
                    people ready to go overseas. The focus had shifted to the Far East, and China,
                    and they somehow learned that I had a good deal of background in China in relief
                    work, and had done some training people to do relief work. So I was recruited
                    [and came to] Washington, College Park actually, and was in charge of training
                    people to go to China with UNRRA, an international mixed group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was '45.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this really started you off in your career of training
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of training were you giving?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was very brief. We tried to give them a little language, enough
                    to deal with the social situation, the courtesies. There was great pressure at
                    that time to get people out, as soon as possible. Gave them something in the way
                    of history, background, and culture. And then on the nature of the projects that
                    they would likely be working in. When that was winding down another project came
                    up, and this was again initiated by the Church of the Brethren that I'd been
                    associated with. This was through a negotiation they had had with the Chinese as
                    to what they might do in terms of relief work back in China because of their
                    historic interest and background [to] understand China. And what they came up
                    with was what turned out to be the forerunner of the Peace Corps. One of the
                    things that was needed was to as quickly as possible return to cultivation of
                    land that had gone out of cultivation as a result of the war. The major area was
                    the area that had been flooded by the Yellow River when Chiang Kai-shek blew up
                    the dikes to stop the Japanese advance. [It was successful], but it washed out
                    several million acres of the best agriculture, [which was now overgrown] with
                    stubble and brush. [The objective was] to as quickly as possible get [area] this
                    back into production. The idea here was to use heavy equipment. The Chinese were
                    not familiar at all with [mechanization], meaning sending some operators. The
                    Brethren said, we [are a rural group and] can recruit fifty young men who can
                    understand the operation and maintenance of heavy equipment, farm equipment.
                    UNRRA said we could put this under the wing of UNRRA, and you can work with the
                    Chinese counterpart of UNRRA which was SINRRA, the Chinese National Relief. And
                    because of my background and I was being freed up at that point, UNRRA said you
                    go out and be our liaison with this unit. I agreed and the Brethren said, you'll
                    simultaneously be the director of the unit. I said, okay. That was another
                    interesting year that I spent in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: '46-'47.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get there, and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We flew from California. At that time the UNRRA people had a
                    special contract, and I guess with the cooperation of some officially associated
                    with the military unit, and military troop transports, we flew to Shanghai, with
                    many stops along the way. At that time I was married, and had a young son, and
                    dependents were not allowed to go at that point, so I went alone. They came
                    about six months later. We were stationed in Shanghai as the headquarters. From
                    there on [we] struggle [with] the bureaucracies of UNRRA, bureaucracies of the
                    Chinese, and the renewed civil war, trying to carry out [our] project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got there in '46. Where was your group
                        concentrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The headquarters was in Shanghai. We had to bring them into
                    Shanghai, and then disburse from Shanghai. The area that we were most interested
                    in was the Yellow River area, where we thought we could do a concentrated job, a
                    quick job, and move out. The idea at that point was not to try to introduce
                    mechanized farming in China. Some of the major tractor manufacturers donated
                    2,000 tractors to our project. They probably had in mind eventually maybe...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For all those millions and millions of customers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. As it turned out for political reasons the
                    Nationalist government, SINRRA, wanted to satisfy demands [for] little projects
                    all over China. [Well], we couldn't operate without their cooperation in China,
                    [so] basically [our] group's [efforts] had to be dispersed which was the first
                    mistake that was made. Although we did get the major operation started in the
                    flooded area, and we got it started in time so that when the dikes were repaired
                    and the river was put back in its course, the area was safe to operate in. We
                    were there with tractors and training and so forth. But by that time the civil
                    war had resumed in the area. [Our] units that were operating in the area were
                    sometimes captured by the communists, and sometimes by the Nationalists. In a
                    few cases they were required to haul military equipment, and we decided because
                    of our [neutral] position, we would pull out. We couldn't operate in a situation
                    of that sort.</p>
                <p>Just to jump ahead very briefly. My last trip out I went back to Xian to see the
                    terra cotta army. While I was waiting, in the area with the visitors outside,
                    there was a woman and her young daughter sitting there and I sat down beside
                    them. We got into conversation. Her husband and their older son were continuing
                    walking around the area. I was sitting down because I was tired of walking, and
                    we got into a conversation and it turned out that she came from near this
                    flooded area, a city that I had been in and knew about. She said, after we'd
                    talked a little bit, “You know, my grandfather told us about these foreigners
                    that came in with iron cows, [which is what they called the tractors], in the
                    flooded area [to prepare the land. They were very uncertain about what this was
                    all about, and were wondering whether this another type of Japanese invasion, or
                    just what it was. But they were persuaded to go back,” and that he, in fact, had
                    benefitted from this tractor operation, and had gone back into the area to
                    resume his farming. At that point, the daughter, [who was] in the third grade,
                    came around her mother and gave me a little gift, a jade locket. I said, “I
                    can't accept this. Why are you giving it to me?” “Because of what you did to
                    help my grandfather.”</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>It's interesting how some of these things come back, and under circumstances one
                    would never never expect. But I think probably the interesting thing about this
                    project was that in a fairly direct way, it became the forerunner of the Peace
                    Corps. Here was a group of people working under an international organization,
                    [a] government type of organization with volunteers [working] for subsistence,
                    [an] agreement [which] was very similar to what the Peace Corps is now. You get
                    your subsistence and your travel, your medical, and things of this sort but
                    basically no remuneration. So when the Peace Corps idea began to blossom, I got
                    involved with it as a consultant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the young men work? What was your impression of
                        theffect on the young men of doing this type of work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, last December we had a reunion, the 50th year reunion.
                    Fifteen of the group got together down in Texas and we reviewed what had
                    happened. How it affected the lives of the people. So far as these were
                    concerned, there was a direct relationship between the experience they had,
                    [even though] there were many frustrations and complications, and what they
                    chose to do later on in life, almost inclusively did service type of work in
                    their communities. And many of them as a result of this had gone on. One of them
                    particularly had seen the health problems and decided he wanted to be a doctor.
                    He became a doctor. Interestingly he wanted to pursue the [holistic] approach on
                    which he had gotten from the Chinese - their approach to medicine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're talking about 1947 when you had to pull out. What
                        diyou do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I was approached, I think from the consulate in Shanghai. They were
                    looking for somebody to head up a post-war Chinese language training program for
                    young Foreign Service officers in Beijing and would I be interested. They
                    obviously had some knowledge about what I'd been doing in the intervening years.
                    So I went out to take a look at it. Beijing seemed very attractive as a place.
                    My wife at that time was with me in Shanghai. She agreed [to go to] Beijing.
                    [During the fall] of '47, [we] went up to Beijing, [where I] directed a program
                    for young officers specializing in Chinese.</p>
                <p>Q: I was thinking this might be a good place to stop. We'll pick it up next time,
                    we've got you in 1947 starting a language school up in Beijing.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>This is December 17, 1997. Howard, let's start with the setting othe language
                    school - what was it called in those days? Beijing or?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: In 1947 we called it Peking, or in Chinese Beiping, because the
                    Chinese capital was at Nanking. I guess before we get to the school here, I was
                    invited to come up [late] in 1947 by Tony Freeman who was then I think he was
                    the acting CG, Consul General, in Beijing at the time, or maybe he was the
                    consul general. He had been a language officer, perhaps one of the better ones
                    in terms of his facility with the language. He had been instrumental back here
                    in Washington, as I understood it, in talking with the people at the Foreign
                    Service Institute about setting up a field school for advance training in
                    Chinese. Training in Chinese in the Foreign Service had been suspended during
                    the war. [There was the pre-service group]; Tony had been a member of that. He
                    had more or less learned on his own and did very well at it, but he had the
                    feeling that it ought to be an organized program, particularly for adult
                    students who came in, and in the beginning didn't know their way around at all
                    in terms of how to approach the language, or what we saw the priorities were in
                    terms of the different skills that were necessary.</p>
                <p>I had an interview with Tony, and a little later when I got back to Shanghai I
                    received an invitation to join the staff, to go down to the consul general's
                    office in Shanghai, and be sworn in, which I did, and found myself to be a
                    member of the Department of State, having never set foot in the Department of
                    State up until that particular time. Not knowing who my bosses were back in
                    Washington. I did not actually open the school. This was done by another person
                    who didn't stay with the program, he was [there only] briefly. But there were
                    some preliminary things that were done, taken care of before I arrived. But my
                    responsibility, as defined to me by Tony Freeman, was to run the school, and
                    design a program training the future Foreign Service Chinese language officer
                    corps. I took that as a responsibility throughout my entire career.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you give me sort of your approach? This is a very important step.
                    Chinese is, I won't say unique, but it has ideograms and it has the language. In
                    most other languages you kind of learn the language anyway you can get it. You
                    did not come to the language really from the academic side, but really from
                    personal experience.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Personal experience and some experience in training,but at a much
                    lower level than was required by the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and Tony Freeman, you had to have almost a philosophy
                        anapproach. I'd like you to talk about what it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, basically, starting off with the assumption that language is
                    what is spoken. That's what we concentrated on during the first part of the
                    program. There's general agreement on that. And only after you are able to
                    comprehend what is spoken to you and are able to respond to that, we felt only
                    at that point it would be judicious to introduce the characters. We had to
                    decide what characters to learn out of the 50-some thousand that are available.
                    What would be useful to the Foreign Service within the limits of the training
                    period, to be learned within the limits of the training period, and then to
                    gradually build up from that.</p>
                <p>The second part of the philosophy, I think, on the training was that it needed to
                    be job oriented. We needed to find out what these officers would likely be doing
                    when they went into assignments as Chinese language officers. And then you begin
                    to prepare them for that. Among other things, we found that the duties that
                    would be required involved reading the Chinese newspapers, at least being able
                    to scan it. You probably couldn't depend on most of them for good translations
                    of that, but at least enough to read to find out whether it was worth turning it
                    over to Chinese translators to be translated in full into English, or whomever
                    needed to review it. The second part of this was documentary Chinese.
                    Documentary styles, as you probably know, have changed and were in the process
                    of changing from the old very formalistic styles that were used, to new
                    formalistic styles that were being introduced and were a much more informal
                    approach basically. And that required specialized vocabulary, and specialized
                    phraseology to be used under appropriate circumstances.</p>
                <p>The third thing was to act as interpreters where necessary, and to be
                    participants in negotiations. And this required a vocabulary in economic fields,
                    military fields, and events in the political field, and to some extent in the
                    cultural field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at that time also looking at the communist
                        phraseology?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: At the beginning we were not.</p>
                <p>Q: I was just wondering in the political field there was something which one
                    would have to deal with and what the outcome was, and they have their own
                    special phrases.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: As the program developed later on, and as it became clear that the
                    communist were in the process of taking over China, that was introduced. For one
                    thing we needed to listen to the communist radio, and to know what they were
                    talking about which we had as part of the program. Another aspect of the
                    philosophy was that language is really a cultural subject, and it cannot be
                    divorced from culture or the area studies side of it. This had not been
                    emphasized in previous training. It was something that I felt very strongly
                    about myself. Anyone who was going to be a specialist in Chinese would likely
                    spend a number of years either working in or on Chinese affairs needed to have a
                    pretty good background in Chinese geography, history, culture, religions. And
                    the question was how to get that in. We started off by renaming the school,
                    Chinese Language and Area Studies. We gave ourselves a mandate, in other words
                    trying to introduce this into the program.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way you were blessed by the fact, this is 1997, we're celebrating the
                    50th anniversary of the Foreign Service Institute, so you didn't have an
                    institutional bureaucracy in Washington which was just forming at that time,
                    sitting on you, did you?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Not at all, in fact, I felt rather uneasy about nohaving met my
                    boss back here who happened to be Henry Lee Smith.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, “Hocksie” Lee Smith.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: “Hocksie” Smith, the head of the language school, and with whom
                    Tony Freeman had discussed what should be done in Beijing. So I got indirectly,
                    from Tony, as to what the philosophy of training back here was.</p>
                <p>Q: The traditional learning process in the United States was, you sat with a
                    book, and you learn vocabulary. I went through this in Latin and French,
                    Spanish. You sort of learned the vocabulary, and you read and you read and don't
                    talk it, or very little. That was pre-war. Were you picking up the wartime
                    experience of military teaching?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Very much so. And the reason for that was that Henry Lee Smith was
                    one of the instrumental people in getting the military program going during the
                    war, and in developing textbooks that would approach language learning from the
                    oral side of learning. I learned a little bit from that from the texts that were
                    used, basically military text at that time, borrowing from some of the material
                    that the missionaries had used, and at that time there was a college of Chinese
                    studies in Beijing, the director whom I knew well, and I was able to meet with
                    him and borrow and use some of the materials that they had. Henry [Finn], the
                    then director of the College of Chinese Studies. My approach was to find out
                    what situations our people would be in, and to develop oral dialogues based on
                    those situations, and to learn the vocabulary that was necessary for those.
                    These ranged all the way from the very simple social meetings, to hiring a
                    [pedi]cab, to getting a train ticket, whatever, hotel reservations, all the way
                    from that on up to the meetings that might be anticipated with officials in the
                    government at different levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had not serve in the government, so whom were you
                        tappininto to find out what would be the sort of getting around the
                        city.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I was tapping into former language officers. I had gotten a good
                    deal of this from Tony Freeman to begin with. There were several others that
                    were around, Edward Rice was one, at my age names slip, but there were several
                    that we contacted, plus we formally sent messages to the embassy in Nanking and
                    various consulates that were still open in China at that time, asking them
                    questions about usage of officers that would be coming in and how they would be
                    used and what their functions would be, etc. We tried to build dialogues around
                    that. [As to] hiring Chinese staff, [we hired] some old scholars who knew the
                    tradition of China and the classical forms of the language, and [hired] some
                    relatively young people. Had one person who spent part time with us who was a
                    Chinese-English major at Beijing University who spent part of his time with us.
                    We had good help and good assistance in that.</p>
                <p>By the time I got to Beijing to start things off, Mr. Oliver Clubb, had arrived
                    and was the new Consul General. I remember my first meeting with him. He was
                    very uncertain as to which direction I should go, but what relationships would
                    be having never served in such a situation before. Mr. Clubb was very
                    approachable and [made it clear] from the beginning that this is your job, you
                    do it, and if you have problems come to me, otherwise I'll keep hands off. That
                    was reassuring because Clubb was a language officer himself, and by reputation
                    was a very precise and well organized, and very focused sort of person. But we
                    hit it off well, had a good relationship during my stay there. The major problem
                    that I had with Mr. Clubb, he was so organized. He was so precise in his timing,
                    [that] he had a schedule that was really based on minutes. And part of that
                    schedule was getting in a half hour of physical exercise early in the morning,
                    and his preference was tennis. And I was the chosen person to get up and play
                    tennis with him in the morning, which was good for me also.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the area studies side, what resources did you tap for
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, first of all, required reading. So we developed, with the
                    help of various scholars that were coming through, a reading list. Asked the
                    Foreign Service Institute back here to provide us some funds to buy the books,
                    or better yet, buy them and mail they out to us. At that time it was hard to get
                    material out there. And then to draw on local resources. Beijing was a cultural
                    center, a center of universities, Yenjing University, Beida, Qinghua, so there
                    were a number of people we could call on. People really well versed in their own
                    fields. And then there were a number of Fulbright scholars. I shouldn't say a
                    number, there were several Fulbright scholars who were out there studying in
                    special fields, and we were able to invite them in and to call on them. For
                    current affairs, current events and things of this sort, correspondents liked to
                    come to Beijing and they would usually stop by and we were able to tap some of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you at that point concerned about, what in modern terms we call political
                    correctness? For example, thinking of the book Red Star Over China by Edgar
                    Snow, and there were some other books on China that looked somewhat favorably,
                    if not quite favorably, on the communist side. Was this a problem?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was not a problem. What we could get our hands owe used.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any particular books, we're obviously talking about something 50
                    years ago, that were particularly good for what you wanted to know?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, for basic history at that particular point, and some cultural
                    contact, [there was] Goodrich that we turned to. But on the geography, Pearl
                    Buck's husband, had done a good deal of work on Chinese geography.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering, you talked about correspondents, particularly in this early
                    time. The people who come to my mind are Theodore White, Edgar Snow, and is it
                    Agnes Smedley? And there must have been others. I mean were they involved in
                    what you were doing?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Teddy White was. But Agnes Smedley, no. Edgar Snow, no. Although we
                    had Snow's book, Red Star Over China which was there. We were paying attention
                    to what was going on. To some extent also because my own personal experience and
                    background in China, both with the tractor unit, which had been just before this
                    assignment, where we had run into problems with the communists. And in trying to
                    maintain a neutral position [for] UNRRA in the work that we were doing. So I had
                    come into contact with them, and also because I'd had contact with some of the
                    communist leaders in '38 and '39. So I was well aware of what was going on
                    there, and the people that were focused on them.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Q: How did your school differ from the old Chinese Language School. I think of
                    General Stilwell, Ridgway, and other military. But I suppose with the Foreign
                    Service prior to that. Was there a difference?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, there was a difference and it became quite clear what the
                    difference was. When I took over the job in Beijing there was already an army
                    language school in operation. I've forgotten how many, but there were I guess 20
                    or 30 people enrolled in that school. My first question really was, why do we
                    need two government schools? Some of the things we have in common. There are
                    some technical things that the military people would need to learn that we don't
                    need to pay much attention to. But there's a lot of overlap and it just seemed
                    to me...but... I was told to stay away. They were determined to have their own
                    and to maintain a separation. I pursued it several times while I was there with
                    the director of the army program in terms of at least when I invited in some
                    distinguished speaker that I could also invite his people and we tried to
                    schedule things in such a way that we could join forces on that, and certainly
                    not duplicate. And I had contacts that they did not have.</p>
                <p>Q: At that point, we're talking about 1947... I'm a graduate of the Army Language
                    School in Monterey in 1950, and frankly the way I was taught there, took
                    Russian, hasn't really differed from both languages I've taken at the Foreign
                    Service Institute. So you're all working out of the same well, weren't you?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right, we were.</p>
                <p>Q: This might be a point to ask about Henry Lee Smith, because he was really the
                    person who developed the system, wasn't he? Or at least in part.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: He was certainly one of the king pins in developing the army
                    language system. There were half a dozen, Milt Cowin, I've forgotten the man who
                    did the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background? What did you know about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I knew practically nothing about him until I came back to the
                    United States. But his background was in linguistics, historical and descriptive
                    linguistics, and his approach to language training was based on linguistic
                    analysis, and highly focused on the oral spoken language. He was a gregarious
                    person. Had had a radio program at one point, Where Are You From, which at one
                    time was well known. If he couldn't guess where you came from within a certain
                    radius, you would get a free refrigerator or something like that. In those days
                    that was the technique that he used. This was relatively easy to do once you
                    knew the landmarks for this.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And regional accents were still regional accents,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I think the strong point for Henry Lee Smith was that he had a lot
                    of contacts in the linguistic community, and was able to attract to the
                    Institute a number of young promising linguists who were able to build on the
                    system that had gone into the military training program, and to adopt and apply
                    this to this Foreign Service. And at the same time to move ahead in really
                    relating language to culture. In doing this, he also recruited a number of
                    anthropologists. And we can talk about that later when we get to the Foreign
                    Service Institute itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stick to China. In 1947 when you arrived, what was
                        thpolitical situation in that part of China when you first arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The civil war was a continuing problem at that point. General
                    George Marshall's efforts to arrive at a shared power agreement, something of
                    that sort, did not work. And it became pretty clear that the struggle was going
                    to continue. The communists had acquired a good deal of strength during the
                    period of the Japanese occupation, and immediately thereafter. They were held
                    back to some extent in Manchuria. They probably expected to get more assistance
                    from the Soviet Union in terms of being able to take over the Japanese equipment
                    that was left there when the Japanese surrendered. But the Russians took
                    everything they wanted first, [and the communists got] what was left over. They
                    also took a lot of the factory heavy equipment, industrial equipment out of
                    Manchuria, and moved it into the Soviet Union. That probably held up the
                    communist advance somewhat, we don't know how much, but somewhat. Even when I
                    was there in '47, at least as I look back on it now, it was pretty clear to me
                    and to those I was dealing with, and to Mr. Clubb, that the communists would
                    probably at least take over north China. There was talk at that time that might
                    be a period, maybe an extended period, of a divided China north of the Yangtze
                    River, and south of the Yangtze River. And that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
                    probably had enough strength south of the river. The frustrating problem that we
                    were dealing with at that time was that Chiang seemed unwilling to put the
                    resources necessary into defending Manchuria. And if Manchuria went, and we were
                    watching to see what would happen, or if Manchuria went, it was pretty clear
                    both in terms of the way history repeats itself and plays out, that north China
                    would soon follow. And that's what happened.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the students who came there? The first crew. Can you tell some of
                    their background and as you were feeling your way around to developing this
                    program?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There were several there when I arrived. One of the things I
                    learned pretty early in the game was, we're going to get students with a wide
                    range of backgrounds, and we'd have to accommodate that which probably meant
                    much more individual programming in training than any sort of group training.
                    Ralph Clough was one of the students, and he had spent some time at the...was it
                    Yale in China?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Yale in China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Jerry Stricker was another one. Oscar Armstrong who had some
                    background, having lived in China. It ranged all the way from people who had
                    some experience, some background, and a start in the language already, to those
                    that were complete novices that didn't have any background. One of the things
                    that I tried to work out through correspondence with Henry Lee Smith in
                    Washington was that we try to use the language school [in Beijing] strictly for
                    advanced training, and that certain background could probably be provided for
                    them back here in the States, or at universities, etc., who were using the
                    modern system of teaching. And would come out to us only when they could really
                    make maximum use of living and studying in the culture itself. We weren't in
                    business long enough to get any real system going on that.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you feeling any of the winds of what later became known as McCarthyism
                    there? John Stewart Service is having his problems and this is mainly sourced to
                    former Ambassador Pat Hurley who had very strong feelings. I think in diplomatic
                    terms most of Foreign Service people would describe Hurley as a prime horse's
                    ass. But at the same time he was politically powerful. Were you feeling any of
                    that?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Not directly, no. Well aware of it, and well aware of some of the
                    problems that the Chinese language people had gotten into on that. Particularly
                    where there was a feeling of criticism of Chiang Kai-shek. And Theodore White,
                    of course, had his say on that and we got his views on that. We also had the
                    views of some of the Foreign Service people that were coming through.</p>
                <p>Q: I realize we're really talking about a rather short time before the place fell
                    apart, but were you able to tap into people who were coming from the United
                    States to tell about China and the political repercussions?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Very little. We got a little bit of that...I used Clubb also who
                    had arrived just about the same time that I did, in terms of what was going on
                    back here in the State Department. I also arranged for him to have briefings
                    with the students as a group periodically to bring them up to date on the
                    information that he was getting through the channels that are open only to the
                    head person there. And he was very good at that, and took an interest in the
                    students, and I think kept them pretty well abreast of what was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the plan for housing and getting the students
                        coming ito get absorbed into the community? How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We had to take the housing that was available. We took advantage of
                    property that I guess had been acquired during the period when Beiping was
                    the...when we had a legation there, and Sanguangao, which had been probably a
                    part of the old Han Institute, the Chinese Board of Examiners in the old days,
                    studying classical Chinese, bordering on that. There were some Chinese style
                    houses that were available there, and we put our students there first and by
                    preference, because they were a little bit separated from the consulate general,
                    from its main compound. We held our classes there also. It was also easier in a
                    place like that for Chinese who wanted to come in freely to come in. They
                    weren't faced with going past someone guarding the gate so to speak. Later on
                    when things became tense we had to move out of that area, and we moved into what
                    had been the old marine barracks which was converted into office space. I was
                    given space on the ground floor. The Army Language School had the top
                    floors.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I did was to have field trips much as you do in the schools
                    here, you take the kids out to museums. So we organized a number of field trips
                    that would take us out to look at things. Plus, and somewhat to my later regret,
                    I argued and got funds to send [our students] on field trips outside of Beijing
                    for two reasons. One, to get a little experience with dialects that were spoken
                    in Beijing itself. The second reason for this was, and this was a personal view
                    that I had, that the Department and our official establishments in China, were
                    too much focused on the urban areas when the majority of the Chinese population
                    lived outside, were rural. And that we needed to know a little bit more about
                    what was going on in the rural countryside. And the only way to get that is to
                    send them out. So we sent them out early on, sent them out with an instructor,
                    so they would have a companion. Later on, go out by yourself and see if you can
                    make your way. Some of them took some very interesting trips. Later on, after
                    the communists took over, I was to learn that they were well aware of this, and
                    considered that I was running a spy ring in Beijing, and that one of the
                    evidence for that was that I was sending these people out all over China,
                    obviously to gather information.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...which is what I was doing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That caused me some problems later on.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Q: Before we come to that, was there any debate, concern...could you talk a bit
                    about the thoughts you had, and Clubb and others...is it Chubb or Clubb?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Clubb, Oliver Edmond Clubb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...about Mandarin versus Cantonese. I mean the languages
                        oChina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There was no question at that particular point as to what we would
                    focus on in the north. For two reasons, one, Mandarin is by far the language
                    that is used by most of the population. At least 70-80 percent of the population
                    could manage at that time to function in the various dialects of Mandarin.
                    Cantonese, a different language basically related, Fukienese, a different
                    language, but related. Hakka, a different language, but related. The minority
                    languages, the mountain people, the Turkic people, the Tibetans, Mongols, etc.,
                    were at best 10 percent of the population, and were not of particular interest
                    in terms of political, economic focus. So concentration, no question, was on
                    Mandarin Chinese.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any problems from the fact that the majority of Chinese in the
                    United States spoke, I believe, am I correct in saying they came from the area
                    around Canton?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No. Later on, when we were pushed out of China, or left China, we
                    did begin to focus on some of the other languages, Fukienese because of Taiwan.
                    We never did get into Hakka. But Cantonese, yes, we wanted to train some people
                    in both Mandarin and Cantonese, and Taiwanese. But that was later, that was at a
                    later date.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe events, and how they impacted on
                        youoperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, it's hard to know where to begin. It becampretty clear, we'd
                    move when it fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is when, in '48?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, and when Angus Ward was forced to leave, in other words he was
                    held under less than free conditions while he was there, and was really pushed
                    out. He came through Beijing and we had a chance to meet and talk with him. But
                    it was pretty clear from what was happening in Manchuria, and the fact that
                    Chiang was not willing to commit enough troops. He probably didn't have enough
                    confidence in doing that, he was harboring his strength for events later on. But
                    it became pretty clear at that point that we were a target, and we would
                    probably go down. How that would happen we weren't sure. There was a pretty
                    strong feeling, and Clubb had this, as well as the committee of the diplomats
                    who were in Beijing, and the major countries all left people there to keep a
                    finger in the pie, and then to report on what was going on. And Clubb would meet
                    regularly with them. There was a committee that would meet and they were trying
                    to coordinate their reaction to this about whether when to leave, or not to
                    leave. There was a movement underway, and I think the British probably took the
                    lead in this, and that was to get the city declared an open city so in the event
                    the communist came, it would not be destroyed, [because Beiping was] important
                    internationally as a cultural center. Important to China. I know that Club felt
                    that in a way that was, yes, go ahead with that, but he didn't think the
                    communists would really attack the city. His feeling, I think, was that the
                    traditional Chinese military approach to things would be such that the communist
                    would move in, close off the city, would isolate it, and that a deal would be
                    made with the General defending the city, and that it would be turned over
                    without any major attack on the city.</p>
                <p>We began to organize ourselves, obviously in '48, for an eventuality of whatever
                    might come. I was assigned the job of laying in stores and supplies in case we
                    ran short of food, and if there was a siege of the city that went on for a long
                    period of time, there might be a problem, also in charge of medical problems or
                    services. One of the people did help with the evacuation of people that might be
                    leaving because I could handle the Chinese language. We received information
                    from the Department that dependents could be sent home. Among the students, most
                    of us decided not to keep our wives there, and in one or two cases I believe,
                    they decided they would send their families home. I decided to keep mine in
                    Beijing. Again, feeling that the risks were probably minimal, there would be a
                    lot of inconvenience. The personal risks would be rather minimal. And I didn't
                    expect there would be a direct attack on the city.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The other thing was, my wife was pregnant, and we were expecting another child
                    and we didn't want to be separated at that particular time. But the program went
                    ahead, on schedule, without very much interruption. To the extent that we could
                    we continued field trips in areas that were still open to us. In one particular
                    case, without mentioning a name, one of our students who had been a former
                    Marine, this is when we were under siege, decided he wanted to go out and see
                    how close the communists actually were. He borrowed a Jeep from the [motor]
                    pool, and headed off towards the east, towards the city at Tongzhou. He was
                    advised by the Nationalists that were at the gate of Peking at that time, not to
                    go any further. They didn't know where the communists were, but we don't have
                    any more troops out there, it's a no-man's land. But he decided he would go
                    anyhow, he hadn't gone very far and he saw there was nobody in the field that he
                    could see. He decided that he better turn around and come back. He got turned
                    around, but as he started back, there was fire from some of the farm houses on
                    both sides directed at him and his Jeep. A couple tires were knocked out, the
                    radiator was punctured, a bullet through the windshield. He couldn't turn the
                    thing off, it got too hot. He came to my office, white and shaken up. He had
                    found out where the communists were. We had those kind of discipline
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Q: During this time, what was the feeling towards the communists among...I mean,
                    your personal feelings. You'd had dealings with them, but there was this
                    situation in Mukden where Angus Ward was our Consul General and his staff were
                    kept basically as prisoners.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...they were under house arrest.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, and it was not an easy house arrest at all. We have a long interview with
                    Elden Erickson, who was there as a staff, sort of like a secretary, to Angus
                    Ward. What was the general feeling, and your feeling about almost can we do
                    business with the communists. After all, it hadn't been that long that we'd been
                    allied with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There seemed to be a general feeling...well, first of all we had a
                    pretty realistic view of the communists just by virtue of the experience that
                    Angus Ward had had, and from reports that we were getting pretty regularly from
                    Chinese who had contacts through family and so on out in the areas that were
                    controlled by the communists. I personally had had some experience in trying to
                    get a tractor operation started in the Yellow River, and knew the problems that
                    were involved in that. I had also, even early on in the '30s, had run into
                    several situations that made it clear to me that the communists, on one hand,
                    could wear silk gloves for a while, and on the other hand, could be extremely
                    ruthless. I'd actually seen and experienced both sides of that. Clubb, himself,
                    was really a scholar, and was really the right person there at the right time.
                    He knew the Soviet Union, he had served in the Soviet Union, his Chinese was
                    good, and his contacts were good. He was realistic, and knew how to deal with
                    them. I think he hoped that we could stay on because he felt it important that
                    we maintain contact with them, that we don't completely lose contact with the
                    communists. He needed to know what was going on in China, and the best way for
                    that would be to maintain some contact there, whether informal or official,
                    dependent on how things would develop. I believe this was the general view of
                    the other representatives from other countries in Beijing at the time also. In
                    fact, the reason for leaving us there, it was clear that Beijing would go, was
                    with I think, the hope that some arrangement could be worked out whereby we
                    could maintain some relations with the [incoming communists] however informal.
                    That was the way we proceeded. Clubb, as I recall, really based his reporting,
                    and his approach to this on that assumption, and was led in several instances I
                    believe to believe that it might be possible that the communists might not want
                    to put all of their eggs in a Soviet basket. That they might be realistic enough
                    to know that in terms of economic development, assistance and so on, that they
                    would have to turn some place else than to the Soviet Union, that had been
                    through a devastating war period, and who else was there, the United States. But
                    he was a realist, and [knew] there were a lot of problems.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you involved thinking about transferring the school, or did anyone think
                    about transferring the school to Nanking, or southern China?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, we stayed on. The communist laid siege in the city, and on
                    several occasions fired shells into the city, but carefully avoiding the old
                    legation area, and carefully avoiding the Forbidden City and cultural places of
                    that sort, which was encouraging to us. But Clubb maintained close contact with
                    the defending General, Fe Zhouyi, and I remember he was probably under siege. He
                    came to dinner at Clubb's house, I was present at the dinner also, was able to
                    talk with his wife. He gave no indication at that point as to what was going to
                    happen insofar as we were concerned, at least verbally he was going to defend
                    the city. But it was pretty clear from other signs that that was not the case.
                    He had already made a deal to turn the city over, in return for which he would
                    be given a position in the new government.</p>
                <p>The actual takeover was quiet. We were told to stay in our compounds. Several of
                    us did try to get out on the streets a little bit to see what was going on, and
                    were not bothered. One of our students was taking movies of the liberation
                    parade and they confiscated his equipment and film. But initially there seemed
                    to be no problems. The city was quiet and the staff would still come to work. We
                    kept the school going. So the predictions that we had that they would exercise
                    their initial control with kid gloves on seemed well founded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you by any chance, prior to this, had you dusted off
                        the books about the Boxer Rebellion, and the siege of Peking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Oh, yes. We were all well aware of that, and werprepared. But the
                    turnover was really quite peaceful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this do anything to the curriculum of the school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, several things. One, it became harder for us to get people in
                    on the area studies side. We obviously couldn't get the communists, they would
                    not recognize us at all. More of my time was spent on helping Clubb with some of
                    his problems. There were still a lot of Americans that were in the area, and
                    some of them wanted to leave. There were property problems, there were all kinds
                    of problems helping American citizens, and the students decided to stay on and
                    see what was going to happen. The communists refused to recognize Clubb's
                    official position. As far as they were concerned he was a foreign citizen
                    staying on in Beijing, stay on as long as you mind your business, so to speak.
                    But it presented a problem to him. When things came up that needed to be
                    represented to the local authorities, which was then the communists. He did not
                    want to sort of compromise his position by going himself, so he would use me or
                    a couple of the students to do this for him. It became sort of a game that we
                    played with the Alien Affairs Office, which was our contact.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>We would go in with a problem, so and so wants to leave, or has a property that
                    has been occupied, this was American property. First of all, you'd be met by a
                    low level clerk, or officer whatever it was, who would want to know what
                    business you had, and who you wanted to see. We don't know whom we should see,
                    but here's the problem, can you tell us whom we should see. So we would orally
                    tell them what the problem was. Then routinely you would say, well, this was in
                    writing and we knew this and we had it in writing, here it is. They would look
                    it over, oh, this is signed by Mr. Clubb, U.S. Consul General. We can't accept
                    this, we don't recognize his position. So you'd say, you know what the problem
                    is now. Well, would you cross off his name? I'd say, I can't do that, he's my
                    boss and from our point of view he is the American representative here, and
                    that's his title. So, you know what the thing is, I'll just take this letter
                    back. Oh, no, you can't take it back, you've already given it to us. So we'll
                    cross it off. You want to cross it off, all right, then that's still what he is.
                    Then we'd ask is there a chance that we can see somebody and talk about this
                    issue who has some authority. Well, we'll let you know what the outcome is. This
                    was at least a weekly affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the problems sometimes be solved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Sometimes it would be. Sometimes the solution would not come back
                    to us. It would be dealt directly to the situation or the person involved.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at this back from the perspective, what was the American rationale,
                    and what was the Chinese communist rationale for this non-recognition,
                    recognition, and all that?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It's hard to say what the communist rationale was. My own
                    interpretation of this was that they were uncertain when they first came in, as
                    to whether they wanted to keep ties open or not. They could easily have made
                    life difficult for us as they did in the south. The fact that they didn't
                    initially do this seemed to be a very clear indication that at least within the
                    hierarchy of the decision makers, that they were uncertain as to which direction
                    to go.</p>
                <p>I think the reason why they didn't want to recognize the official position of
                    this was that they didn't want to have direct talks, negotiations, with the
                    foreigners at that particular point. Part of it was also they wanted to wait
                    until their position in China was clearer. Until they had achieved military
                    control over all major parts of the country. Then their dealing with the
                    foreigners, the outsiders would be different than when they were only partially
                    in control. But I think there was a delay for that reason. From our point of
                    view there was nothing we could do about it. But there was the incident that
                    caused us to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Let me build up to that. It was clear that they were moving towards the
                    establishment of a government as soon as they were in control of China as a
                    whole. They would formally announce an established government and the seat would
                    be in Beijing. This was the accomplished on the first of October 1949. An
                    interesting personal incident that was involved with this. When we established
                    official contact with the Chinese after Nixon's visit...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in '72.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...and to set up liaison offices rather than formal embassies. Han
                    Xu was sent by the Chinese government to Washington to open their liaison
                    office. The Ambassador came later, and Han Xu himself was later appointed as
                    Ambassador. But shortly after he arrived the word came to me from the East Asian
                    desk that it would be nice if we could find a reason to invite him to come to
                    the Institute to show courtesy by recognizing that he was here. So I invited him
                    and he came with several of his staff people. We were in the building in Rosslyn
                    [Virginia] at that point. When he came upstairs in the elevator, following the
                    Chinese pattern I went out to the elevator to greet him. They'd had let me know
                    that he was coming up. He strode over to me, put out his hand, and his English
                    is fairly good, he said, “Mr. Sollenberger, I believe we've met before.” I said,
                    “That's possible. I don't know. I was in Peking in such and such a time.” He
                    said, “I was the young officer at that time that handed to you at the entrance
                    of the U.S. Consulate General, the declaration of the establishment of the
                    People's Republic of China.” I said, “I remember, but I'm afraid I don't
                    recognize you at that particular point.”</p>
                <p>Back in Beijing in '49, increasingly we were having difficulty as the time went
                    on. The Chinese feeling that they could come into the compound. And this began
                    to cause me to wonder how much longer we could keep this thing going because we
                    needed our instructors, and up to that point they were willing to come in. They
                    hadn't faced any personal pressure or problems. There was another incident that
                    occurred. The gate keeper one night came to the house that I was living in,
                    banging on the door. He said, you've got to come out to the gate, there's a
                    platoon of the Liberation Army out there demanding entrance. I said, all right,
                    but we'd better let Mr. Clubb know about this also. So there had to be time out.
                    I'll go out and see what the problem is. They were out there, and there was a
                    good deal of tension. They were demanding to come in, and I couldn't quite
                    figure out why they wanted to come in. They were trying to explain that they
                    thought that we had done something to the guards that had been stationed in
                    front of the consulate compound. Of course, we'd done nothing at all of that
                    sort. And they wanted to come in and search. Well, Clubb joined us at that
                    particular point, and we're talking back and forth. We finally agreed that we'd
                    let them in, but we would accompany them, not into the buildings, but to the
                    compound. We hadn't gotten very far, following the compound wall, where we found
                    several rifles that had been thrown over the wall. What had happened, obviously,
                    was that their guards had gone AWOL. They thought that we had something to do
                    with that. As a matter of fact, we did. My son, he was then four years old, had
                    a little Jeep and he would regularly go out to the...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a peddle car.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, a peddle car. He would regularly go out to the gate that led
                    into the compound, and while the guards were under strict orders not to
                    fraternize with us, a kid was something else. He established pretty good
                    relations with them. I used to send tea out with him, and Life magazines to look
                    at, and he would report back...I ask him what sort of questions they asked him.
                    Well, they wanted to know whether we beat our servants or not. And what kind of
                    food did you eat? In other words, there were all sorts of questions about our
                    relationship with the Chinese. Apparently they thought we were ogres of some
                    sort. I've always credited him with causing the first defection. One of the
                    guards that was there at this particular time this happened had the same Chinese
                    surname, that I have. So he was “da Su,” and my son was “xiao Su.” They got on
                    pretty friendly terms on the basis of it, having the same surnames.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the ways the Chinese communist, when they first took over used were
                    very heavy handed in Mukden, but did but later in Shanghai, and I guess
                    elsewhere, to put pressure on us were claims that we either had caned the
                    Chinese, or we'd mistreated the Chinese. This became sort of the lever which was
                    used a lot. Did that hit you?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That hit me, yes. Towards the end, various pressure was being put
                    on the Chinese tutoring staff from the outside. They wouldn't talk about it.
                    They wouldn't talk much about it. But when it became clear that after the
                    decision that we move out, made clear that we were leaving, that they had to
                    stay and make their peace. The instructors got together accused me of
                    withholding part of their salaries. And probably several other things having to
                    do with the students' trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this cooked up do you think, by the Chinese
                        authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was cooked up. Well, it was cooked up by the Chinese authorities
                    and it was an embarrassment to some of the instructors. They said, we know you
                    haven't done this. You're leaving. We're going to have to stay, and going to
                    have to face it. I had already sent the message back through Clubb, and he
                    certainly supported it, that we ought to be very liberal in severance pay for
                    these people. I was at that time recommending...I've forgotten whether it was
                    six months, a half a year, severance on that service they had rendered, whatever
                    excuse they wanted to use to do this. And the answer came back, no. It was
                    eventually negotiated that they would get, I think, three months. In the
                    meantime they'd taken this to the authorities and I was summoned to the People's
                    Court to explain and fortunately the records that are kept are very detailed in
                    matters of this sort. There was a three man arbitration panel. After laying out
                    the evidence on this for them, and being questioned by them on a number of
                    different things, not on the students' field trips, not on spy charges. This was
                    strictly on the way in which we had dealt with the people we had employed. They
                    finally told the instructors, you better take what you can get, and that settled
                    it, and I had no trouble getting my exit permit.</p>
                <p>Q: Which is interesting because in other cases sometimes the demands, I mean from
                    what I've gotten from other people, the demands of the Chinese employees were
                    one, excessive, two, not really of their own volition. The Chinese communist
                    courts sort of backed them up in order to cause real trouble. It sounds like
                    there wasn't an unified...</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This is not the case where we were. We got by fairly peacefully. It
                    was only later, as I was leaving, that a piece came out in the Chinese press
                    that I was leaving and called me the head of spy ring.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, by this time the People's Republic had been established,
                    there was a government in Beijing. They were in effective control over most of
                    China. In other words, there was really no major resistance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The incident that caused us to leave, maybe you have this from
                    other sources, the incident that caused us to close down and to leave was when
                    they announced that they were going to take over the old Marine barracks, which
                    was part of the mission, located in the legation quarter. The American point of
                    view, and our point of view, was that these facilities were acquired by treaty
                    rights, and we stood by that interpretation. They said there was a difference
                    between the old legation quarter itself and the Marine barracks, and anyway we
                    don't recognize these treaties anymore, and we're going to come in and take it
                    over.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, at this time. Clubb obviously was in touch with Washington
                    back here and how do we deal with that. And we decided we would stay put as long
                    as we could, and see if they would back down, and it became apparent the day
                    before, and they announced that they would take over, that they were not going
                    to back down. So everybody turned to, and vacated the old Marine barracks
                    building. Files had already been burned, and furniture and stuff like that was
                    hauled over to the legation compound and was stacked up out there, and they came
                    in and occupied the premises. But we had apparently made it clear to them that
                    if they did this, any chance of recognition, or contact, would be erased as a
                    result of this act on their part. It was from our point of view an illegal act
                    in opposition to our treaty rights. So from that point on we began a gradual
                    withdrawal and that incident was the sort of thing that brought the Chinese
                    staff into play. They were concerned about what was going to happen to them, and
                    we were concerned about what would happen to them. We'd had enough stories about
                    the Chinese from indirect sources about what was happening to people who had
                    close contacts and worked for Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening, what you were getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: First of all, they would put the people through a brain washing
                    process, and sometimes with torture, and sometimes were persuaded. There didn't
                    seem to be a consistent pattern, and to some extent on who was in charge at a
                    particular place at a particular time as to what the pattern would be. We had
                    one person of the staff caught up in this, he'd gone to see about his family and
                    had been picked up and was held for several months and ___, but came back and we
                    got his story. We had a pretty good idea as to what might happen, and what could
                    happen to the Chinese ___.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The school continued right up until the end of the year. The
                    schedule was disrupted somewhat from time to time, partly because some of the
                    instructors were having difficulty in getting in. But we kept some classes going
                    right up to the end of the year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We had to get permission to leave the city, and you had to have a
                    physical examinations to get out. There was some concern as to whether they
                    would use that rule to hinder us or not. Our son developed pneumonia at the time
                    that we were supposed to leave, and had gotten permission to leave, so we wanted
                    to extend our stay a little bit until he got over it. There was also the problem
                    of getting your household things out. The State Department had authorized an
                    earlier shipment of effects if we wanted to do that before the communists came
                    in. We took advantage of that to some extent, but we still had things that we
                    wanted to ship out. It was uncertain as to what we would have to go through,
                    whether they would take all the stuff apart and go through it and see what we
                    were taking out, and just how they would deal with it, departed by way of
                    Tianjin.</p>
                <p>One humorous incident. I had some traveler's checks and they wanted to know if I
                    had any currency, you can't take these out, you can't take foreign currency out.
                    Phil Manhart was then consul in Tianjin and he was there helping me get out. So
                    I said to Phil, “You keep these and see if you can find a way to get them out to
                    me.” They saw me hand them to Phil. I didn't hear anything about these
                    traveler's checks for a year or so, until American Express said, “Your checks
                    have been cashed in Hong Kong.” I said, “That's news to me. I've already
                    reported that I couldn't bring them out. I had to leave them there with Phil.” A
                    couple of years later I got a letter and a check from David Barrett, an
                    assistant military attach�, with a big apology saying that Manhart had entrusted
                    him with bringing the checks out, but he ran into a desperate situation and had
                    to cash them. In the meantime, so many things had happened that he had sort of
                    forgotten about this and suddenly realized what he had done, here's the check to
                    cover everything.</p>
                <p>In Tianjin, the Chinese inspectors only opened one box. I had everything very
                    carefully listed. They opened one box and closed it up before we left, and we
                    got out without any problem although there was uncertainty throughout as to
                    whether there would be problems, blocks put in our way. They could have said,
                    your physical exam shows such and such, we'll have to keep you here until you
                    get over that, there were all kinds of excuses to keep us there. But they seemed
                    to be at that particular point prepared and willing and maybe even happy to see
                    us out.</p>
                <p>Q: How did the timing work? Here you were in 1949 declared to be the capital of
                    China. We'd had an embassy in Nanking. Then that fell to the communists. And
                    then I think people moved to Shanghai, and then that went. What had happened at
                    the time you were being expelled, what about our people in southern China?</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I think the decision had been made back here in Washington at that
                    point that we would withdraw, and that meant everybody. It was a matter of
                    scheduling and timing in order to get everybody out of China. I don't know the
                    details and never looked specifically into this in terms of the record as to
                    what the Department's statement to the Chinese was. Judging from the results, it
                    became perfectly clear to us in the field that we'd issued an ultimatum saying,
                    if you take this step the chances of any relationships with you are being
                    destroyed by you, and we'll pull out. At least that was the effect of the thing,
                    and I presume that that's actually what happened.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the feeling that you were getting from the officers who were talking
                    to, Clubb and others, about this policy? I mean, here was a sort of a new
                    nation, and in the normal course of things, we'd say, okay, there's been a civil
                    war and these guys have won, and with a little huff and puff, you'd say, okay,
                    let's recognize it and get on with our business. Was there any feeling at that
                    time, or were you so far removed that you didn't get it, about there were a lot
                    of domestic politics within the United States, or was this just because the
                    Chinese communists were being so beastly.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We knew that there was a political problem back home with regard to
                    China. The fact that we were being accused of losing China, and not supporting
                    Chiang Kai-shek. The feeling on the spot, as I best recall it, and in talking
                    with Clubb about this, was that we couldn't really ignore...at that time they
                    were still talking about five hundred, six hundred million people, and the
                    government had taken control of that area, and we needed to have a listening
                    base at least in China, and Beijing was the place to have it. We'd been left
                    there with the prospects that this might happen and it had gone sour, we were
                    pulling out. The communists were asking for recognition, but Clubb's position on
                    this, and I think he was right on this, and as it turned out he was right, was
                    that while we might go ahead and decide to recognize them, they might not be
                    willing or able to reciprocate, and that would put us in a difficult position.
                    The British seemed to be more inclined to go ahead and accept the fact that
                    China had been taken over by the communists, and recognized the argument that,
                    because we have to do business, we have to know what's going on. They did extend
                    diplomatic recognition, and as Clubb had sort of predicted, the communists were
                    very slow, with all sorts of obstacles in the way of recognition. I think the
                    French were that way also, and the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, there was such a to-do later about France recognizing communist
                    China. They didn't recognize until the '60s, I think, under de Gaulle. But the
                    British didn't get anything out of it this the whole time, I mean, it was still
                    ended up the United States versus China. I mean, this was the big game and the
                    rest of them were were kind of there but almost invisible.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: A trend that we began to pick up even before we left were some
                    reports that all was not well between the communists and the Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was then in the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: How serious that was, nobody quite knew. But it did become apparent
                    from a geographic point of view, the way in which the Chinese Communists had
                    been sort of short-changed in their takeover of Manchuria, and in the way in
                    which the Russians had been dealing with the Chinese on this. That some of the
                    old feelings of the Chinese, toward the northern barbarians, seemed to be
                    emerging. How serious that would become nobody at that point quite knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your young Turks, your students? How were they
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, presumably they were studying. [Laughter] One of the
                    problems, after the communist takeover of the city was that they weren't as free
                    to move about, and certainly not to go out of the city. You had to get
                    permission, and they were not likely to get permission to do that. The foreign
                    community was sort of thrown in on itself, and there was a lot of social
                    activity, invitations, etc., to the point where I had to send a letter out to
                    the other official establishments and other countries out there, requesting them
                    to please limit their invitations to our students to weekends. That they had
                    homework to do, and it wasn't that they didn't want to be social, that they
                    would probably rather do that than study. But please understand this, of course
                    the students were not exactly pleased with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you played the role of the heavy hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They got along well. We could still go out and havChinese meals
                    together.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, of course, if you've got to be trapped in a city, and Beijing is not the
                    worst place to be trapped in. While we're still dealing with this period, were
                    there other language schools? I'm thinking of the French, the Germans, the
                    British had something there, were they using sharing of techniques, how did this
                    work?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The British had their facilities in Hong Kong, so any training they
                    were doing was confined there. We knew that, but there was really no contact.
                    The question came up at one point about some Australian students maybe joining
                    us. They later joined us in Taiwan at the school there. The College of Chinese
                    Studies stayed open as long as they could, and there were some foreigners that
                    were put in the College of Chinese Studies. The French, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Howard, this might be a good place to stop. We've
                        got youp to going back to Washington. You went to Washington in 1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 6th of January 1998. You're back in Washington. Did you come back to
                    a job? Or were you sort of at loose ends?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: A little bit of both, I guess. But just by way of a general
                    comment, I had never set foot in the Department of State before I joined,
                    because I was recruited in China, and was there until I came back. But I had a
                    general sense of pride, of being a part of the Department, at that time because
                    of the legacy of George Marshall, and Dean Acheson. Of course, he was still
                    Secretary of State at that particular point. But the thing that shocked me when
                    I got back was to find the low esteem in which training was held within the
                    Department, and the newly formed Institute seemed to be a stepchild.</p>
                <p>Q: This, of course, has always been a problem with the Department of State.
                    Sticking to 1950, because I like to catch this at the time, how did you find out
                    how training ranked? What were you gathering?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Of course, the first thing I did when I got back was to call on my
                    boss, Dr. Henry Lee Smith. He was running the language school in the new
                    Institute. It was then located in premises on C Street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, about where the diplomatic entrance is now.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, that same entrance. It didn't take very long to look around,
                    and see what was actually taking place; how people were selected for training,
                    and the seriousness with which training was considered. Actually, very little
                    time was allowed for language training at that point. There was a junior officer
                    course, and as part of that, as I recall, they had an hour or two hours a day of
                    language training for a short period of time that they were there, hopefully in
                    the language of the country to which they're going. I think that they involved
                    at that time in about 30 different foreign languages, but these were frequently
                    taught by people who had no background in those languages. They were
                    professional linguists. And an effort was made, wherever it was justified in
                    terms of the number of students, to have a native speaker of the language there
                    to be a model for the students to follow, which was the pattern that had been
                    established by Dr. Smith.It didn't take long also to pick up the grumblings
                    within the then Institute as to the difficulty of getting the necessary
                    resources. Just looking at the facilities, they were certainly not appropriate
                    for a training institution. They were in a converted apartment building. My
                    office turned out to be on the 9th floor, in what had been a bedroom with a
                    bathroom attached which was very nice. They gave me a place to put my files,
                    things that had been accumulated on the China program. And Dr. Smith suggested
                    they would like to have me stay on at the Institute. I wasn't sure whether that
                    was the right thing for me to do or not. I thought I needed something a little
                    more active in relation to China, which is where I had had my experience. I
                    looked at USIA [U.S. Agency for International Development], and I looked at AID
                    [Agency for International Development], and they were not interested in my
                    qualifications at that particular point. AID was looking for technical people
                    with technical skills, and USIA was then only hiring people with media
                    experience and background, which I had not had. So I decided the Institute was
                    probably the place to stay for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the state of Chinese language training in
                        1950?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There were no people going to China at that point, because our ties
                    there had been cut off. There was a question as to whether we should continue
                    the long term specialized training in China. As that turned out that became
                    really one of the things that I probably fought the hardest for, and maybe had
                    some influence on, in maintaining at least the minimal amount of training on the
                    assumption that sooner or later we were going to have to deal with China, we
                    couldn't ignore what was then considered 500 million people, regardless of who
                    was in charge. And that if we ignored China, then we would be suffering the same
                    sort of gap that they were complaining about because they hadn't given training
                    during the war period, and found a gap of officers at appropriate grade levels.
                    Of course, nobody knew when or how soon, and what the circumstances relations
                    would be to re-establish. It wasn't clear at that time as to what the role of
                    Taiwan was going play in this, although that became clear very shortly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you looked at the army language school at Monterey or

                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No, I hadn't. My experience with the army training program as it
                    was run in Beijing at the same time I was there indicated that's not a place I'd
                    be very happy in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: May of '50.</p>
                <p>Q: Because essentially against that on June 25, 1950 interests in the Far East
                    began to heat up again. How did the advent of the Korean war...I mean, you
                    didn't have time to almost find your way to the bathroom before the Korean war
                    started. Did that have any affect on what you were doing?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Initially, not very much. It took a little time foit to sink in,
                    and, of course, when the Chinese got into the conflict...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about around November or December of
                        1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: When the Chinese decided to come in, then there was some interest
                    in training, and also utilizing the language officers who had already received
                    training. They stationed them in the key positions around China: Japan,
                    Southeast Asia, certainly in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>Q: At this time I've interviewed people who were language officers in Burma,
                    Indonesia, Thailand, China-watching jobs. Would this pep up the program at
                    all?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It would, except for the strictures within the Department itself of
                    personnel system. The answer we were constantly getting was, if we don't have
                    positions, assignments, there's no point in continuing training. Particularly
                    when the Department, and particularly the Institute, was short of funds,
                    personnel was short, the personnel system felt it was in a tight, tight
                    situation. The Department generally would have been willing to let training
                    slide for a while. I kept insisting that something had to be done, even though
                    they didn't have immediate slots, there would be plenty of opportunity as things
                    went on to utilize these people even in places like London, and different
                    European capitals where there was some contact and interest in China, and what
                    was going to happen in China.</p>
                <p>Q: There's nothing worse in sort of the new boy on the block, and don't know
                    anyone who may have had clout, prestige or anything to build on, and yet you hit
                    at an extremely crucial time. How did you operate?</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: In September 1951, I was given the title of Assistant Professor of
                    Chinese Studies, and was given an administrative job, sort of the executive
                    officer of the language school. I think Dr. Smith seemed reasonably impressed
                    with the way in which I had brought the facility, the school in Peking, and I
                    must have some administrative skills to do that. So that was the job that was
                    given to me. Also the job of looking after the overseas language programs which
                    they were trying to the institute, to get people if they couldn't study the
                    languages in Washington before they left, to study in the field, or if they did
                    study here, to provide continuing training when they got to the post. And I was
                    given responsibility for looking after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in setting up, or the development of,
                        Arabic,Japanese training. Actually there was even a French school in
                        Nice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That was considerably later. I was involved and given
                    responsibility for these establishments. The only other one at that particular
                    point was in Beirut. But there were plans to move ahead on Japan, and
                    traditionally there had been a school in Japan. So I was involved in getting
                    that started, finding a location in Yokohama.</p>
                <p>Q: There was, particularly at this point, the prestige of the Russian language
                    officers, Bohlen and Kennan, and others. Did you try to use that as a model for
                    saying this is what we have for China...</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We looked at a variety of different approaches for China.
                    Eventually on the Chinese side we looked at Hong Kong as a possible place to
                    train, there were facilities there, and some very successful models. The British
                    were there training in Hong Kong. We looked at Singapore as a possibility, some
                    place where the students might have a chance to utilize the language outside the
                    classroom. First of all, the few students that were given to us, aside from the
                    universities, get university training here...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning Yale had a good course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Cornell had a training program also, and actually the person who
                    had written the Army ASTP [Army Specialized Training Program] text on Chinese
                    was at Cornell, so that was an option also.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any problem about using university training for Foreign Service
                    Chinese studies...I've heard at other times and other languages the university
                    programs were designed to train scholars to do research, and were not really
                    very practical for Foreign Service. Was this a problem?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was definitely a problem, and that's why we chose the Yale
                    which is where the Air Force program had been set up which was based on the Army
                    system, and Cornell. As I recall also we looked at some of the California
                    schools, Berkeley principally as a possible place. I was interested particularly
                    not only in giving language, but in giving a few officers a good solid
                    background in area studies, the cultural, historical, economic, political
                    dimensions of the Chinese culture which historically had been dynamic, and from
                    my point of view I thought in the future was going to be and that we should have
                    people who fully understood this as well as people who could speak the
                    language.</p>
                <p>Q: Was it a hard sell? I mean you were talking about the language, but also about
                    what we would call area training. Again, I find the Department of State seems to
                    be an historical organization.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was difficult to sell that. We had a window of opportunity to
                    get that started in the Department of State when the National Defense Education
                    Act was established. Of course, that was tied to Sputnik, it came a little bit
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was around '56, '57.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right, and there an interagency committee was set up to
                    focus on different parts of the National Defense Education Act. Title IV was the
                    one that we were the most interested in, or I was, because this was the part
                    that dealt with language and area studies. And the effort to beef this up in
                    universities, which we were all for, but also to see within the government what
                    resources the country had, there was a survey that was required of all of the
                    agencies of the government. They were supposed to identify the language skills
                    and the area skills, background, of people who may within the various government
                    agencies, particularly those who had to do with foreign affairs. Of course, they
                    had no standards for doing this. What sort of a standard would they use. If you
                    used the university standards oA-B grade for second year, or third year, or
                    fourth year, that didn't tell you what they could really do with the language.
                    They certainly had nothing that was useful so far as identifying area expertise.
                    That task fell to the Foreign Service Institute, and this is one of the things
                    that was handed to me by Dr. Smith, who said, see what you can work out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had to be the latter part of the '50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That came along a little bit later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk here about the language thing. Was there much
                        supporfrom what passed as the China desk, as far as language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, there was support, but at that time there was some strain, I
                    think, between the operating bureaus who were constantly pressing Personnel for
                    staff. And the question of releasing people, personnel would go to the bureaus
                    and say, fine training, who are you going to release for training, because
                    that's going to leave one less hand that you have on the job here, for
                    assignment elsewhere. So there was tension there as well as between the
                    Institute and the personnel system. But there was support because Clubb was
                    there and he understood the necessity for this. Tony Freeman who had helped set
                    up the program was around, and he supported it. And the students that we had
                    trained in Beijing, some of them were being assigned to jobs on the desk and in
                    the bureau at that particular time. So there was support, but there was no
                    consistent pressure to continue training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see Henry Lee Smith operating within the
                        thDepartmental environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: He was an academic. He was frustrated. I think one of the reasons
                    why he turned some of the administrative operations over to me was that he
                    wanted to be free to do some of the research that he was interested in doing on
                    language and culture. And they were working at that time, the professional
                    linguists, on an analysis of language that they thought was a step up from the
                    systems that they'd used before. In a way the Institute was leading the way in
                    linguistic analysis at that particular time.</p>
                <p>Not only was Dr. Henry Lee Smith there, but George Traeger, who is a well known
                    linguist was also on the staff, and they brought in some anthropologists who
                    were interested in the linguistic area studies side. Edward T. Hall, who later
                    became famous for the best seller book that he wrote on silent language. Gerard,
                    an anthropologist, Bert Whistle, the kinesologist who was interested in the way
                    in which body language was used. This all was a part of an effort on the part of
                    the Institute to find new ways, better ways of teaching. But also to keep in
                    with the academic community.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the state, as you sampled it at this early '50s, of the field of
                    linguistics? Now it's a big business, but what was it like then?</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was rather small. It was rather difficult to find qualified
                    linguists. They hadn't been trained during the war. There were people who had
                    learned the languages, but not done professional training in linguistics. The
                    fact that Henry Lee Smith and George Traeger being at the Institute was an
                    attractive thing. And their approach to recruitment I had to admire, that was
                    that they were trying to hire linguists on the basis of coming for just a
                    limited period of time to the Institute, but with the objective of returning to
                    the academic community for two reasons. One, to build back into the academic
                    community a more practical approach to their language instruction programs. And
                    the other one was, that the government didn't offer that much future for
                    linguists in terms of promotions in government employment, and that linguists
                    would probably generally become frustrated with the bureaucratic problems. I
                    remember Dr. Smith talking to me at one point, he said, your job here in terms
                    of administration is to make it possible for professional people to do their
                    work with limited interference from the bureaucratic system. So anyway you can
                    relieve them of the pressures of the bureaucracy would be helpful. That's good
                    advice up to a certain point, but anybody who works in the government sooner or
                    later has to realize that the matter of getting the resources to do what you
                    want to do, has to be taken into consideration. Otherwise, you can't do your
                    job.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you finding about your results? You were seeing the product of the
                    American school system - elementary, high school, college, of people coming into
                    the Foreign Service. And with the exception of those who happened to have lived
                    overseas, and maybe acquired it with their parents or something, what was the
                    language capability among the new Foreign Service officers?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: From the point of view of practical use as required in foreign
                    affairs business, it was hopeless, very poor. The recruitment of people from the
                    army who had been through the army language training program, there were a few
                    of those that were coming into the Foreign Service. There were a few from
                    missionary background who had grown up overseas who came in with the language.
                    But by and large the recruitment for the Foreign Service at that particular
                    point did not place any premium on knowing a language, so they were not getting
                    the people who were qualified. And the argument at that time was that if we
                    recruited for language skills, we're going to get people who are basically not
                    very well suited for the Foreign Service because the people that are
                    specializing, majoring in foreign languages, are people that are focused on that
                    one academic thing, and we need broader people, we need to get people who have a
                    broad background in the Foreign Service. And it just wasn't bringing in people
                    who had the skills.</p>
                <p>Q: I took the Foreign Service exam in '53 which was pretty much the recruiting
                    thing then. You took the exam, and you took the language exam in one of five
                    different languages, but you didn't have to pass it. That was just something
                    they'd say well, you've got to get yourself qualified once you're in. You
                    couldn't get promoted. But basically I could see what they were after.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Even in getting promoted, it wasn't an important factor at that
                    particular time. What the Department wanted, I think, by giving that exam was to
                    try to find a few people who had the language and could be assigned to the then
                    important posts where it would be useful. Training became the subject of a study
                    of the Department's personnel system towards a stronger Foreign Service...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're showing me a booklet, it was published when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was published in May of '54. It was the so-called Wriston
                    Report. This is the report really that began to turn things around for the
                    Institute. But part of the problem, as it developed that required something to
                    be done on this, came a little before that. This was the beginning of the
                    problem of McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the Senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Senator Joseph McCarthy and his looking for card-carrying
                    communists in the Department of State. And, of course, this had an effect on the
                    Chinese program also because people were increasingly reluctant - officers - to
                    get into a field if they were going to become targets of an investigation. For
                    the Institute this was probably the most trying period in its history. It came
                    very close, I would say, to putting the Institute out of business. That's
                    because when they started investigating the Department of State, the first team
                    that they sent in was sent to the Foreign Service Institute. I think they
                    suspected they would find the long-hairs there and they seemed particularly
                    suspicious of the anthropologists, people dealing with the behavior of foreign
                    peoples. But it reached the point in the Foreign Service Institute...I can't
                    really remember whether there were 9 or 13 investigators, and the Institute
                    wasn't that large at that point, that took up residence and were at the
                    Institute for the better part of three months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Just an illustration if I can give this, I think it would give you
                    bit of the atmosphere that we went through at that time. I got a long distance
                    call in my office, a call that my secretary should not have put through to me,
                    but she did, so I answered it. I later saw the person, he said, “What was wrong?
                    You didn't sound very communicative during the call that I made to you.” I said,
                    “Here's the situation.” There were three investigators in my office at that
                    time. One of them was going through the files in the bathroom where I had the
                    Chinese material that had been sent back from Beijing, much of it in Chinese.
                    And, of course, he was very curious about what these things were. You're welcome
                    to have somebody translate them for you if you want them. And I went there and
                    went through them, identified what the different files were, etc. The other
                    person was going through the books in the bookcase that I had, and these were
                    books on China, and linguistics, language training, etc. And he was picking up
                    the books by the covers and shaking them to see if there was anything hidden in
                    the pages of the book. And the third one was sitting at my desk here. While I
                    was trying to take care of these three people, he was also interrogating me on
                    my experience in China, and particularly on the contacts that I had had with the
                    communists back in 1938-'39-'40, and about Mr. Clubb. That was the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many investigators were there at one time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Nine or thirteen. They had an office, they were set up there, they
                    were interrogating all the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom were they reporting? This was not the House... the
                        Congress...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They sent someone to the Department who...</p>
                <p>Q: This was part of Truman's Loyalty Board. Scott McLeod came in a little later.
                    Scott McLeod was charged with consular and security affairs, so it may have been
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They were also very suspicious of the instructors who were
                    foreigners, not even American citizens many of them. At one point they started
                    to call the tutors over to the Department of State for interrogation. And it was
                    never clear as to whether they were using lie detector tests on them, or whether
                    they were simply recording, but they were at least recording the interviews that
                    they had. They started off at the beginning of the alphabet, and Burmese came up
                    pretty early in that. When the Burmese instructor was called over, who was a
                    well known Burmese in his own country, and his wife worked at the Burmese
                    embassy in Washington, a quiet but very independent person. When they started to
                    interrogate him and ask him, according to his report back to us, how much he had
                    paid Dr. Smith, or me, for the job that he had there. A number of questions of
                    that sort that didn't seem appropriate at all. He got up and walked out, and
                    they didn't know what to do about that. They weren't expecting this. He came
                    back and of course reported to us on what had taken place, and said that if this
                    is continuing, I'm quitting. Well, this was a crisis for us because there were
                    other instructors that were lined up to go over. We were able, through Dr.
                    Smith, to get in touch with Walter Bedell Smith...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who at that time was number two in the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Dr. Smith had been a classmate. He called him up and explained what
                    had happened, and from that point on it was stopped. They did not call any of
                    the instructors over again. Within the group that I was familiar with, and I was
                    closest to the linguists, and the staff at the language school, I think probably
                    90% of us, almost all of us, would have resigned at that point, if we could have
                    resigned. We didn't dare resign because that would have been a sign that they
                    were right, the rats are running. They thus must be the culprits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the investigation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They didn't really know what they were looking for. They didn't
                    know how to go about it. They were following the lead of someone else who was
                    pulling the strings. Apparently they somehow learned that Dr. Smith had pulled
                    the cord, so to speak, on the instructors. I gather they were out to get him,
                    and also to get the anthropologists. Whether they were after me, I don't know.
                    Anyhow, we survived that but that leads up basically to the problem at that
                    time. It was one of the things that led up to the establishment of the Wriston
                    committee, because it was affecting the whole personnel operation in the
                    Department of State.</p>
                <p>Q: In the first place I'd like to ask one more question about the people doing
                    the investigation. Did you have a feeling, there's a certain amount of “us and
                    them” atmosphere, and the State Department had the reputation of being elitist.
                    Did you have the feeling these were...I hate to use the term in a pejorative
                    sense, but sort of anti-intellectuals, and that sort of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I would say that most of them were. There were a few who were not.
                    There was one who had a Ph.D. who was an academic himself, who tended to be
                    apologetic. Of course, we wondered why he was doing it in the first place, but
                    he tended to be a little apologetic about it. But generally they did not have
                    the background to do this. And there was an anti-intellectual overtone to the
                    investigation, which may have been why they came to the Foreign Service
                    Institute as the first place they were going to zero in on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a horrifying state of affairs at that time. I mean,
                        that you were trapped, you couldn't resign because if you did it would look
                        like you had something to hide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting from Dr. Smith, and also were there corridor meetings
                    among the FSI people talking about, what the hell is this, or how do we answer
                    this.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It became a real morale factor, and Smith really would talk—there
                    were not very many of us—it was a small staff at that point. So we were all
                    involved in it. It was really from these meetings that we sort of came to the
                    conclusion we'd like to be out of this. We'd like to quit, but we couldn't.</p>
                <p>Q: Well then, with the Wriston report...because the Wriston report had a profound
                    affect on the whole State Department. The part that most people remember was the
                    amalgamation of the civil service with the Foreign Service. But you're really
                    looking at a different part of this, aren't you?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I'm looking at a different part of this. I'm looking at the part
                    that had to do with the personnel system, the utilization of personnel, and the
                    training side. A part of the report that became fairly well...it was very
                    important to us, was the section that was entitled The Committee That Never Met.
                    The Foreign Service Act of '46 had set up sort of an ideal pattern for the
                    Foreign Service Institute, and it would be modeled somewhat after the Army War
                    College, was to have status corresponding to that. The Army War College, the
                    Commandant in charge of the Army War College reported directly to the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff, and the recommendation was that the director of the Foreign
                    Service Institute should be an academic of distinction, and should report to the
                    highest levels of the Department of State, should not be relegated as a minor
                    personnel function. At the time that they came in the morale within the
                    Institute was very low. Wriston was very interested in the Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Again, there was a connection between Smith and Wriston that I think brought this
                    about. I think probably Wriston had been influential in persuading Smith to come
                    to the Institute in the first place. And, of course, having been through the
                    problem with the Committee of Active Resources, lack of facilities, etc. I'm
                    sure that Smith gave him an earful. The Committee came to the Institute, was
                    briefed at the Institute on the status of things and the report was a blistering
                    attack on what had not taken place. The Committee had been set up on paper, had
                    never met, and the excuse the Department gave for this was that they could never
                    get all the people together at the same time. The fact was they didn't want the
                    Committee in the first place. But the Committee was to be made up of people
                    assigned by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, each with the
                    Department of State having some academic input, etc. And the names that had been
                    proposed for this were really leaders but they never met, so there was no
                    defense of the Committee at the time that we were faced with the problem that
                    the McCarthy group presented to us.</p>
                <p>Q: In a way I would imagine, I don't want to put words in your mouth, that the
                    rest of the Department was almost delighted...delighted is the wrong term, but
                    relieved to see that there was a lot of concentration on these people who really
                    weren't Foreign Service. The Foreign Service Institute was sort of...you know,
                    they're not one of us and the more they attack it the less they'll be after us.
                    Did you have any feeling that you were a sacrificial lamb?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, we did a little bit but when the Committee was actually set
                    up and Wriston insisted that he do that, and he was going to be present, and
                    they set dates for it, and he had a high powered group that came in. At that
                    time Loy Henderson had just moved into the top administrative position, and he
                    would not absent himself from these meetings for anything, because this is where
                    Wriston at these meetings on the form of training, was where Wriston was also
                    attacking the personnel system, following up on what was happening on the
                    personnel system. It was a very interesting time because these meetings were
                    very dynamic, and they led eventually to their bringing in Harold Hoskins as the
                    director. I'm not sure how he was chosen, some of us wondered at the time. His
                    qualifications seemed to be that he had an important role on a board in the
                    textile industry. But he did have an interest in education, and was chairman of
                    the board of the American University in Beirut, and was involved in other
                    educational activities. He was dynamic. He was given charge by the Committee to
                    bring about some changes in the Foreign Service Institute.</p>
                <p>Q: On this board, did you have a person or persons that you could go to and say,
                    look, we really need this and that. Sort of friends on the board who were
                    particularly sympathetic to you?</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Generally, the language program came out pretty well on that
                    because that was really about the only part of the Institute that was
                    functioning. The junior officer training program was going on and it was a
                    continuing sort of thing. That came under attack, the way in which that was
                    handled. Of course, the whole recruitment system came under attack by the
                    Wriston Committee. But there was generally a good deal of interest on the
                    language aspect of the training program. This, again, may have been because
                    Wriston was the chairman, was interested, and had an acquaintance with Dr.
                    Smith. And the fact that we seemed to be producing something.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that's often used is, to say, look here we are in the United
                    States, a major power, and we're having trouble with this and yet the Soviets
                    are producing so many linguists, or the British are doing better. We're talking
                    about the early '50s, did you have any other Foreign Service Institutes of other
                    countries, or the equivalent thereof, training things that you'd point to and
                    say, they're doing a better job than we are, why can't we emulate them, or
                    not?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Basically, that followed Sputnik, and the publicatioof The Ugly
                    American.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking about Sputnik being the first satellite that was put up by the
                    Soviets, and then there was this book by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer,
                    which talked about how great the Soviets were in producing Southeast Asian
                    speakers, and what a dismal job we were doing.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That had a considerable affect on us. But let me go back here on
                    the committee. The fact that Loy Henderson was there, and heard all of the
                    discussion on the training program, and had gotten acquainted really with the
                    staff of the Institute at the same time, really led later on to a very
                    interesting relationship that I had with Loy Henderson, where he would call me
                    up personally about a number of things. But it also led later to the expansion
                    of the language training, and establishment of the field schools in Spanish,
                    French and German overseas. He began to take a keen interest in language
                    training. And the interesting part of that was that he felt that he had been
                    denied an opportunity when he should have had it as a young officer, and he
                    wanted to see that others had the opportunity to get that. That was one of the
                    benefits that came from this committee meeting, and the fact that Loy Henderson
                    himself came to all of the advisory committee meetings on the Institute on
                    training.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>On the question of Sputnik, and The Ugly American, probably these two things that
                    really led to the establishment of the National Defense Education Act. And
                    putting in the National Defense Education Act Title IV on language and area
                    studies. Of course, this dealprimarily with American education, but also with
                    the needs of the government. There was a committee set up, chaired by Howard
                    Mace, and had representatives of different agencies. I eventually ended up in
                    that group, and met with them representing the Institute and Dr. Smith. It
                    became very clear that before they could do anything they would have to have a
                    system for measuring language proficiency. They turned to the Institute as the
                    place where the linguists were, a group of professionals said come up with
                    something that we can use. So we sat down, and we worked at it. We developed a
                    language area system for evaluating proficiency, or skill, or background
                    knowledge. It was based on a practical utilization scale which later became the
                    S/R scale that's still used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S is for speaking, and R is for reading. And it's a one
                        througfive scale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes. We experimented with different ways of developing the scale.
                    We brought in some outside expertise, psychomatricians who were dealing with
                    matters of this sort. We were in touch with Princeton to get their view. We
                    developed first of all a scale, and a form, that could be used for self
                    appraisal, and we distributed this on a trial basis within the Department of
                    State, to people who had agreed in advance in doing this. That they would
                    subject themselves to a test so we could see how the self evaluation matched up
                    with the test that they were given. And the test was to have been an oral
                    interview, not structured at that particular point. It was really not very
                    standardized, or calibrated properly at that early stage. But we also had a
                    questionnaire on area. That was harder to develop, but we did, and after we
                    tested it out in the Department of State, we decided to send it overseas on a
                    self appraisal basis, on a volunteer basis, and we got quite a few returns from
                    that. And that gave us a base from which to compare later on how tests, as they
                    came back for tests, how this compared with the way in which they had rated
                    themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We found a fairly high correlation between self-appraisal, but we were a little
                    suspicious of that because they knew they were going to be tested. So the
                    tendency, if you knew you were going to be tested, is to lower your self
                    appraisal. But we also had some records from people who had claimed on their
                    applications to the Foreign Service their language skills, and testing them they
                    did not know they were going to be tested after that. We got a little better
                    view on that and decided we couldn't go on a self appraisal basis, particularly
                    if assignments were going to be based on language skills, and if there was a
                    possibility of promotion being based on language skills, you had to be able to
                    defend within reason the scales that you use. We worked very hard on this. The
                    same information was sent out by the government committee to universities where
                    it sort of disappeared at that time. It was only some years later that they
                    began to become interested in the system that the government was using because
                    it had spread from the Institute to others; the Army was beginning to use it,
                    CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] was using it, USIA was basing its program and
                    policies, and AID was doing the same thing. So people coming into the foreign
                    affairs agencies were generally being appraised on the S/R scale that other
                    Institute had developed. So the academic community began to become interested in
                    it, and as some of the linguists went back into the academic community, they
                    took this back with them. It's one of the things that I think the Institute has
                    done that has had a significant impact on language training in the country.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that this practical testing would be sort of a challenge
                    to the universities because there you have an awful lot of language being taught
                    by people who are not native speakers, who have learned it academically. It's -
                    I won't say pro forma - but people can pass a written test, and the whole
                    structure is designed really to produce scholars or at least to get them through
                    to meet a language requirement. So this would be a terrible challenge to have
                    people come up and find out that they really aren't able to function. I mean
                    French is the particular example. When people go to France and find they're
                    absolutely tongue-tied. Were you at all pushing this, or is this kind of let it
                    work by osmosis?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We did some pushing. We had an opportunity to do this because we
                    were also sending people back to universities. When you would sit down with one
                    of the deans, and say, one of the problems we have in this area course that has
                    a language component to it, is that the language component isn't really useful
                    to us. We would generally get the argument back from them, our basic goal is to
                    train people for the academic pursuits. We would come back and say, its becoming
                    more elaborate now because not only is the government going to be requiring
                    this, but increasingly business, and trade, overseas operations of major
                    companies. For some time some of these companies had their own language training
                    programs, like the oil companies.</p>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. And you're going to find this so you need to begin to
                    build in. It took time. And we were willing to give them time, and to cooperate
                    to the extent that we could. Later on, they began to send some people to the
                    Institute to check on our testing system, and on how we taught language, and
                    would take their observations back to their institutions. But change from the
                    academic institution was slow.</p>
                <p>Q: It's very hard because you get instructors for very specific purpose, and that
                    is native speakers. That doesn't fit at all within the academic structure.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, it is increasingly is.</p>
                <p>Q: What about spinoffs. Did you find yourself in a way looking over your
                    shoulder, or were they looking over their shoulder? Berlitz and other
                    organizations that are commercial language trainers.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, we ran into a major problem in getting resources from the
                    Department for the Foreign Service Institute just because of that particular
                    problem. We had to go before Congressman Rooney from New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Rooney of New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I guess his committee covered the Department of State and hence the
                    Foreign Service Institute. It was unfortunate that the personalities of Harold
                    Hoskins and Rooney didn't match, and very early in the game this became apparent
                    to the point where after a couple years, and a couple appearances that Harold
                    Hoskins had, Rooney tried to get him fired. And the reason for this was, he
                    considered him uncooperative in terms of giving training, utilizing Berlitz, as
                    a training program for the Foreign Service. Berlitz was apparently one of his
                    constituents in New York. It reached the point with Harold Hoskins that Rooney
                    brought on the floor when they were debating the State Department
                    appropriations, that Harold Hoskins should be fired - brought this up on the
                    floor of the House. At that particular point the decision was that Harold
                    Hoskins should not appear before Rooney again, although he stayed on at the
                    Institute. And since the major focus of the budget at that point was on the
                    language training program, I was nominated to go up and face Mr. Rooney, which I
                    did for a number of years.</p>
                <p>Q: Rooney was one of the institutional memories of the Foreign Service. People
                    having to testify before him, he was always noted for cutting them out of
                    representational allowance, which he called the Whiskey Fund. It was maybe
                    grandstanding, but there was a whole school of people who were trained how to
                    stroke Mr. Rooney. How did you get along with him? Were you appointed a stroker,
                    I mean a stroker trainer?</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I wasn't appointed as a stroker but I learned fairly early on,
                    being present when Harold Hoskins was testifying, that one of the things that
                    Rooney wanted to do was to make a speech. This was not made for me, it was made
                    for his constituents, and I should not respond to it. So he'd make a speech, we
                    would let it stand, not try to argue with him. Once you started arguing with
                    him, then he would lead you on into a ridiculous situation that would be
                    difficult to get out of. Also, at the time, I got the administration budget
                    office to have personnel respond to the utilization question which came up quite
                    frequently. And it came up with regard to Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. A very famous case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Where the director of personnel was talking about thChinese
                    language officer in London, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was London. Could you give the background to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, the background to that was that there was a language officer
                    in London because this was one of the possible places of informal contact
                    because of the British having recognized China, and we thought we ought to have
                    someone in London who had some background in Chinese. But, of course, the
                    response that was given by the Office of Personnel was, when he was asked about
                    opportunities to utilize his Chinese, I guess he couldn't expose our real
                    interests. He said, I guess there are Chinese restaurants and places like that
                    that he could use it. And Rooney had a hay day with that.</p>
                <p>I very nearly got caught up in a problem of that sort when Nixon wento China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: 1972, yes. I was asked by Rooney whether we had provided any
                    training for Richard Nixon before he went to China. Of course, we hadn't, and I
                    tried to explain about that we had trained people who went with him, and that
                    these people were utilized, and it was fortunate that we had some people who
                    knew Chinese who accompany the President at that particular point. Then he got
                    off of that, and said, “Did you watch that program that showed the President
                    sitting at the table with Zhou En-lai eating? Did you train the President to use
                    chopsticks?” He was trying to provoke something going along that way. But I
                    guess I squirmed out of that one all right. I didn't make the headlines
                    anyhow.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find as the Wriston report was implemented, a change in attitude
                    towards training? I'm talking about the State Department personnel, Foreign
                    Service. Not just at the top, but within the ranks.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Unfortunately it was very slow in coming. The general feeling
                    within the Foreign Service, and quite understandably, was that promotion is
                    based on what you do in a regular job, not in training. And that any extensive
                    time taken out for training, would only be held against you. It was sort of a
                    blank in your career record, and there was no credit really given for the
                    training that you received. That was a continuing problem for quite a long
                    period of time. But one of the things that began to break that was when the
                    Senate, and I think this was largely due to Fulbright and to Mansfield's time
                    who were following up on utilization of the people that had been
                    trained...apparently they had gotten some complaints or something of this sort.
                    And the Department was more or less forced to come up with an assignment system
                    that would show the utilization of people who had been trained in languages. The
                    Senate actually required the Department to identify language essential positions
                    as a basis on which to gauge the number of people who should be trained. And
                    these language essential positions should be distributed from the lowest levels
                    to the highest levels. Then they should report annually on whether these
                    positions were filled with a qualified person or not. The Department didn't like
                    this sort of personnel system. It was difficult to live, from an administrative
                    point of view. At least Senator Fulbright was very insistent on this, so the
                    Department had to come up with some sort of a system to report. When it became
                    quite clear that there was not a very high correlation between the requirements
                    as the posts had identified them actually for language skills, and assignment of
                    language qualified people, well... Of course, one of the things that we found in
                    getting positions identified from the field was that if people who had the
                    language were in a position, they would say, it is necessary. That's why we got
                    this job. People in jobs that didn't have the language, would say it's not
                    necessary. Look, I'm in this job, I'm doing a satisfactory job, it's not
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things that developed out of this, and in a very critical
                    area, Japan. We discovered that the report that came in from Japan had literally
                    people assigned to economic, trade duties had the language. And Alex Johnson,
                    who was interested in Japan, saw this claim and said, I'd like for you to go out
                    and check on this. There's something not quite right. I was planning a trip to
                    visit the school in Yokohama. This is when Reischauer was ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Reischauer was the ambassador at the time, and Alex Johnson
                    delegated me to talk with him about this problem. Reischauer hadn't focused on
                    it up to that point, but he called in the head of the economic...I've forgotten
                    who it was, when I was in his office and really threw the book at him about
                    this. Did you receive this requirement from the Department? Did you designate
                    language essential positions? And you didn't designate anybody in the economic
                    field! He was very embarrassed by this. He didn't have the language himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this is always the problem. It's hard to get
                        non-language person to say you really should have it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It can work the other way also. You can get some people in jobs
                    where it's marginal, and yet from their point of view it's very important, this
                    is one of my qualifications.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you or personnel ever able to go out and do an evaluation? What it sounds
                    like is sort of a self-evaluation which gets tricky in the field.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No. We sent testers overseas to test people in these jobs so that
                    we could give a reasonably accurate report to the Senate on the extent to which
                    the Department was meeting these standards. One of the results of this whole
                    program was that the first fairly optimistic report that had a lot of
                    requirements for a 3 and 4 level, we discovered that it would be very difficult
                    to meet, so the requirements came down a little bit, and the 4s became 3s, and
                    the 3s became 2s as requirements. We tried to get the Senate, Fulbright
                    particularly, to agree that we would go on the minimum requirement and desirable
                    if we could achieve it. That we would try to get higher but the minimum
                    requirement was thus and so. He didn't want to buy that. He said, that's letting
                    you off the hook, we want to keep the pressure on. I was called several times to
                    Fulbright's office to talk about this with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a professor, so he probably was essentially a
                        friend icourt, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: He was, but he was also very critical of the personnel system in
                    the Department. Later on, of course, he was not very popular in the Department
                    because of his stand on Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Q: Did you find a problem as you were dealing with the personnel system, from
                    your particular point of view, something I've noticed is those who rise to the
                    top of the Foreign Service, with many many exceptions, but there seems to be a
                    certain pattern of young men and increasingly young women - particularly in
                    those days it was young men - who would attach themselves to somebody high up,
                    say as a special assistant. These are people who get to know people...their main
                    strength is contacts, and getting to know how the system works rather than
                    essentially what we'd call a substantive job. And getting into language training
                    removes you from this thing, so you have a whole coterie of people who've moved
                    up through personal influence who probably avoided language training more than
                    most. Is this fair to say, or did you notice?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I noticed it. There was an element of this, but you also had the
                    other side of it, people who had the language who capitalized on that, and
                    attaching themselves to what they considered the right places, and moving up in
                    part because they had the language. And increasingly as the designated language
                    position system began to take hold, and the insistence that key positions, like
                    the head of the political section, these became desirable jobs to get into. So
                    that encouraged people towards getting the skills that were necessary. When it
                    reached the point of becoming a factor in promotion, where there had to be a
                    report that was taken into consideration by the promotion panels, this is
                    another thing that encouraged language skills.</p>
                <p>Back to an earlier question that you raised about the Russians, and the French,
                    and the British systems, we did look into those. One of the things that I
                    did...I never got to the Soviet Union although I tried. We invited the Soviet
                    Union to send some people to the Foreign Service Institute hoping to get a
                    reciprocal invitation. In fact, we asked for a reciprocal invitation and there
                    were always reasons for them not granting that, so we stopped asking. But we did
                    get a good deal of information on the British system, on the French system. I
                    went to Japan and visited their training facilities; went to India, Scandinavian
                    countries, Norway, Finland, Brussels. So we had a good deal of information on
                    their training and on their skills that they have, and it became quite clear
                    that by the time we were in the '70s that we were pretty far ahead of most of
                    the others in terms of having qualified people. But language training is only
                    part of what we were focusing on.</p>
                <p>One of the problems in the Foreign Service Institute was the lack of continuity.
                    From 1947 to the early '70s, there were eight directors. So there was not very
                    good continuity. Some of these people were very well qualified, but they had
                    their eyes on other jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really should be a position of much more
                        permanency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: In academic work particularly, education, etc., you have to take a
                    long-term view. A short-term, day-to-day operation is quite inadequate. We had
                    to focus on career training so that when people reached the senior level there
                    would be a certain number of people who had the training background, as well as
                    experience to take over these jobs. And you had to plan at the beginning for
                    this. That was very difficult, not only at the Institute but the same thing was
                    happening in Personnel. Constant change of Personnel directors, and having to
                    reeducate, go through the same process over and over again, reconvince a new
                    group of people coming in as to what was necessary. We tried various ways of
                    getting certain aspects of this institutionalized. Originally Personnel had the
                    sole responsibility for selecting people going into hard language training,
                    specializing. The system we eventually got set up was one that involved the
                    Institute, and it involved the Bureau.</p>
                <p>The other problem we had in the Institute was keeping students in training once
                    they were assigned by Personnel. A job would come up, operations highest
                    priority, pull them out of training before they're finished. It was hard to plan
                    any sort of extensive training program, with the exception of university
                    assignments of which there were not very many, where the people weren't in
                    jeopardy of being pulled out because they were wanted on a higher priority job,
                    from the Personnel and the Bureau's point of view. One of the things that Harold
                    Hoskins did, which was inspired in a way, he persuaded the Department's
                    administration that there be a certain number of positions that would be
                    budgeted for training by the Foreign Service Institute, and the Institute would
                    control the salaries of these people, so that if they were pulled out, they had
                    to be pulled away from positions that belonged to the Foreign Service Institute.
                    This made it more difficult. It gave the Institute a stronger voice in saying,
                    can't you find somebody else to fill this job until this person finishes his
                    training.</p>
                <p>That became a problem also because once you budgeted the positions, you had to
                    show these positions in your budget, and the budget at the Institute went up
                    dramatically because of the student positions that you had. And Rooney would
                    begin to zero in on that, and you had to justify each one of these positions
                    before Mr. Rooney. It was worked out, and worked fairly well for some time. I
                    don't know whether its still in existence now or not, but to me it was a key
                    policy decision that boosted training within the Department of State. It gave
                    the Institute some clout.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The other thing was the position that the Institute had in State's hierarchy.
                    Originally the Institute was a low level branch of Personnel. One of the
                    different Personnel branch of training is one of them. The Foreign Service Act
                    said it should report to a higher level. The Wriston report, the same when he
                    talks about the low level of which he was reporting. That had an affect on the
                    sort of person that was assigned as the director of the Foreign Service
                    Institute. It took some time before the director of Institute position was
                    elevated to the equivalent of the Director General of the Foreign Service. I
                    think the first one that status achieved that was George Allen. They had a hard
                    time with George Allen being the senior career diplomat in the Foreign Service,
                    he was called back. He came to the Institute for a short period of time. But
                    when he came in, he wasn't going to come if he had to report to Personnel. He
                    wanted to report to the Under Secretary, and basically he wanted to report to
                    the Secretary. So at least it got bounced up that way, and I inherited that
                    reporting to the Under Secretary for Administration.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the language tests, the S/R level, there's something always goes
                    through...MLAT, Modern Language Aptitude Test. What's the origin of that, and
                    how was this employed in the Institute?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This came in, not from the Institute. This was not developed by the
                    Institute. It was developed by Princeton's Educational Testing Services. We
                    tried it out, and it seemed to be valid enough that it was useful as just one of
                    the indicators as to whether the individual would be successful in acquiring the
                    language as an adult. It was on that basis that it was used in recruitment, that
                    you would get the scores of applicants on the language aptitude tests. One of
                    the concerns was that we would use this in an absolute way, if the applicant
                    scored low, no go. But we learned fairly early that you had to be careful with
                    that. You had to look at other indicators. We used it in the selection of people
                    for hard language specialization. That there had to be some very special reason
                    for someone to be assigned to a particular hard language if they had an aptitude
                    score below a certain point. There were some exceptions that were made, but it
                    was accepted that there was a cutoff point that we wouldn't consider people
                    below that point, Chinese, Japanese, Russian languages in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something from outside that continued, or was
                        isomething that the Institute itself would tinker with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We tinkered with it, because we found it as a useful thing in terms
                    of selection. So when we were setting up the criteria when the committees that
                    would meet on the selection of people for hard language specialization. And if
                    we wanted to argue on aptitude on this we needed to have something that was
                    fairly standardized and objective. It was reported to be an objective test, but
                    we always, I always insisted that it can't be the sole factor, that there are
                    other factors that have to come in on that. No, we were interested in that, and
                    we checked it out.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Q: I'm not an authority on languages but my wife had a Masters in Linguistics,
                    teaching English is a second language. So as one does on the marital bed you
                    absorb a certain amount of this.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Not exactly pillow talk.</p>
                <p>Q: The linguistic field, particularly at the time you started on this, was moving
                    ahead rather vigorously. One of the things that I've noticed is, and I think the
                    tests show this, the older you get the harder it is to learn a language. How was
                    this a factor?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There is a correlation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You get a very bright but 52 year old person who wants to
                        learJapanese. What do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: You tell him you should have started earlier if that was your
                    interest. In other words, there had to be again some very special reason if
                    you're going to take on someone of a certain age. There was also the question of
                    the rank of the individual for full time intensive training. It was expensive.
                    You're paying salaries of the people, paying the training expenses of the
                    person, and as the salaries got higher it became a little prohibitive. The
                    general pattern that we would follow is that training should be focused as early
                    in the career, if it was specialized language training, as possible. That there
                    would be periods of refresher training as needed in relation to specific
                    assignments later on in their career all the way up to ambassador. Increasingly
                    we had a number of language officers who were applying for this who would want
                    to come to the Institute for a month, sometimes three months, or go back to one
                    of the schools that we had to get a refresher before taking up a job. If it tied
                    in with the assignment pattern, schedule, that seemed to work fairly well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find you had a problem of people being put into
                        languagbecause there wasn't an assignment, or between assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, we had that problem, but that was not so much language as
                    other training fields, as a holding operation. But a holding operation in which
                    Personnel wanted the flexibility of pulling them out, when they wanted to, so
                    Personnel was somewhat supportive of training positions within the Foreign
                    Service Institute.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Q: What about the problem of specific languages for specific countries? Hebrew
                    comes to mind for Israel. But there are other ones. If you take Arabic you know
                    this is great because you've got a lot of Arabic countries. Or if you take
                    Chinese at least there are a lot of peripheral places you can use it.
                    Particularly a language like Hebrew it's one country and actually it sort of
                    excludes you at a certain point - it no longer does - from going to the Arabic
                    countries. How did you deal with that, getting recruits for difficult
                    languages.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It was a problem. In some languages it was hard to find people
                    because there was only one post in some cases. Again, you needed someone that
                    you could call on to cover that post. We tried to make the designation of
                    language as central so that within posts of that language, some of the coveted
                    positions, so that someone going into language training would have an inside
                    track, let's say in moving up to head of the political section, or head of the
                    economic section, or going as a CG [consul general] to a certain post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This means a collaboration with Personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It meant not only a collaboration with Personnel. I may have put a
                    little too much emphasis on the problems with Personnel. It also involved the
                    bureaus. In many incidents the bureau sort of developed their own cores of
                    people, particularly as you began to get specialists and these belong to us. And
                    you also found a reluctance of the bureaus, as well as Personnel, to let people
                    go into long-term training if they were assigned to the bureau complement and
                    pulled out. So it was both the bureaus and Personnel that were involved in this
                    tension with training.</p>
                <p>Q: You had to deal with the problem of all of a sudden the decolonization of
                    Africa in the 1960s. What were the pressures? Here is Africa, all of a sudden
                    with a huge number of posts, a lot of native languages, yet they're sort of
                    divided into Portuguese, English and French speaking posts. Were there pressures
                    to teach Twi, Hutu, or other languages?</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Originally there were not because these were not necessarily
                    coveted assignments, and again one language for one post that would be of no use
                    anywhere else. We tried to do some educational work with the Department,
                    Personnel, etc. on this. As I said, training has to have a future look. We had
                    to look ahead. It seemed to some of us in the Institute that we were going to
                    need people in Africa with these languages early on. We sent some of our
                    linguists to Africa to gather material and develop at least elementary language
                    materials in some of these languages. We had a very gifted linguist who
                    undertook this task, went out with a tape recorder and gathered samples, and
                    brought great information back. We were able to hire native speakers, analyze
                    the language, and did develop in some of the more important languages such as
                    Swahili and Hausa materials. We were among the first to do this. There were some
                    African programs, Berkeley had one, universities, and some linguists in
                    universities who had done some field work in Africa. But no materials had really
                    been developed in some of these languages for use in American education, or in
                    use at the Institute. Well, in India, for example, where there are 14 official
                    languages, at least my feeling on this was that this is a future possible
                    problem that we're going to have to deal with. If we have representatives in
                    areas that do not speak Hindi, we ought to get a few people who can speak the
                    other key languages of India and Ceylon, which would later on became
                    independent. So we developed some materials in these languages and tried to get
                    a few people into training in these. In some cases it seemed more practical for
                    assignment purposes, and for promotional opportunities, to train people who had
                    Hindi as their primary language and adding on another one of the South Asian
                    languages so there would be several posts in which they could be utilized. But
                    more than that also to become more aware of ethnic linguistic problems that
                    creating tensions and friction in that area so we could keep abreast of the
                    possible fragmentation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in many ways you really had to read the papers in the
                        morninto find out what was happening in the world and look ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We had to look ahead. One of the areas that I pressed was
                    Mongolian, and without very much success for a long time. Of course, for years,
                    we had no post in Mongolia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We almost did during the Kennedy administration. We would
                        dMongolia, if the Soviets would do something else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: There were efforts on that sort of thing. But the question was, why
                    do we need to waste the time of an officer, and he wastes his time learning
                    Mongolian when the chances of utilizing it are very slim. My approach on that,
                    both with bureaus and with Personnel, was let's take somebody with Russian
                    background and language and let's add Mongolian to that so that he'll have
                    plenty of posts to use it in in Russia. But he can be the person who focuses on
                    Mongolia. Let's take someone from Japan and give him Mongolia. Let's take
                    someone from China and give him Mongolian. So we actually got several people who
                    eventually were utilized, but it took a long time and I was afraid...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: '76.</p>
                <p>Q: Was anybody looking at the Soviet Union in this time and saying, yes, it's a
                    big empire and they've got multiple languages in there and maybe something might
                    happen. Were you at all looking at things like Krygyz, or Kazak, or any of these
                    other languages, or was this just a pipe dream?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: For the most part it was a pipe dream. No one expected the sudden
                    collapse. There were other languages in the Soviet Union that are important that
                    we paid a little attention to. But here again, our approach was to take someone
                    who had Russian and adding one of these languages on to it so whether they were
                    back in Washington or whether they were in Moscow they would focus on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing any other languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes, we had several cases here where we had Azerbaijani, Romanian,
                    that wasn't in the Soviet Union. We tried to approach it that way but we didn't
                    really foresee the collapse and the immediate need. That's something that came
                    up later.</p>
                <p>Q: I was going to ask one more question and then I thought we might stop it for
                    today, and next time we'll pick it up more for the FSI in general. Can you talk
                    a bit about the war in Vietnam and its affect on the FSI?</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It had an effect not only in the language program but on general
                    orientation. When the decision was made to win the hearts and minds of the
                    Vietnamese people, and where AID would send in representatives, and we set up
                    offices in all the provinces under our control, the decision was made then that
                    there should be a training program that all of these people going out would be
                    put through - AID, USIA, State, and there was a time when Foreign Service young
                    officers were sort of drafted in their first assignment into Vietnam. We
                    considered this a temporary requirement, set up a Vietnamese Training Center
                    which became a school on its own, assigned a linguist, Eleanor Jordan, to head
                    its language program. There was an interagency committee set up to monitor the
                    program. The person who was selected to head it was the person who had seen
                    service in Vietnam, was brought back to review the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Augie Williams was one of them. There were a couple of others, but
                    there was a specialized school set up for it, and intensive training, a lot of
                    effort was put in to developing specialized materials focused on actual needs. I
                    took a trip to visit some of the provinces where the people would be assigned to
                    get a feel for what would be required of them by way of general background. We
                    did get area training into the Vietnam program. And got some rather innovative
                    ways of dealing with the language, tie in the language and area, brought them
                    together. One of the things that I discovered when I was traveling around
                    Vietnam was that the interpreters that were being used, almost all of them, were
                    Vietnamese of Chinese origin. Not only that but what the interpreters were
                    feeding back to the young people was not always very accurate.</p>
                <p>I posed this problem when I came back to the staff here, so they started to
                    review some of the media things that were being put on, and they ran across a
                    piece that was an American newsbroadcast showing an American interviewing a
                    village leader in Vietnam about the local situation. We discovered what the
                    interpreter said was entirely different from what the American was trying to
                    get. It just wasn't working at all. [The American journalist would ask a
                    question and the Vietnamese translator would ask something quite different, but
                    would produce body language that made you think the right question was being
                    asked. Sort of American interviewer: “Do you like the government?” The
                    translator: “How was the crop this year?” Answer with positive body language:
                    “Oh, much better than last year!”] So it was completely wrong. We took that film
                    and we used it in the Vietnam training...</p>
                <p>Q: I saw the film before I went out to Vietnam. I remember that one.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That was using the shock treatment and it seemed to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Q: Why don't we stop at this point and we'll pick it up next time? I would like
                    to ask one more question which I'll ask the next time. We were talking about
                    Vietnam program. Was there any problem with it, with the other agencies that
                    were using this? And then we'll move on to when you moved farther up into the
                    hierarchy of the FSI, more general things including up through '76.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is January 23, 1998. Howard, you said you wanted to talk a bit about the
                    growth of language training after the McCarthy period, Sputnik, the early
                    1950s.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I hope I made the point that the Institute was very crippled by the
                    McCarthy period, and had reached a very low ebb, and that the Wriston committee
                    came in and breathed a little life into it, particularly by establishing a
                    really high powered advisory committee. One of the interesting aspects of that
                    was that while the report itself was focused more on personnel issues than it
                    was on training, Wriston used the committee as a way in which he could continue
                    to monitor what was going on in the Department of State, and put some focus on
                    the training issue. It was a very critical period for the Foreign Service, so
                    Loy Henderson, who was then the equivalent of the Under Secretary for
                    Administration, I've forgotten the exact title, could really not be absent for
                    many of these meetings. To some extent it was through these meetings that Loy
                    Henderson began to see the role of training in the development of the Foreign
                    Service. I would personally like to say that it was during this period that I
                    was able to establish a rather unique relationship with Loy Henderson to the
                    point where he felt comfortable, and I felt comfortable, in his calling me up
                    directly when issues came up that were of concern to both of us. Some of these
                    of these issues initially were not very pleasant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give some examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Let me give you an illustration here. One day I received a very
                    angry [telephone] call from Loy Henderson. He seemed to be grating me one side
                    and down the other, and under those circumstances I [just] sat and listened
                    [but] didn't respond. I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about and was
                    looking forward to an occasion [where I could] explain [the situation] to him.
                    Shortly [after I hung up], I suppose ten minutes or so, a call came in again and
                    he said, “Howard, could you come by my office, [because] I want to explain the
                    call that I just made?” (End of tape)</p>
                <p>...why he berated me over the phone over a training issue. It turned out that he
                    had an irate congressman in his office and he thought the best way to deal with
                    this was to demonstrate to the congressman that he was in charge and control of
                    things, and so he called me up to give me what for. Now I'm happy to listen to
                    what you have to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would a congressman be interested in? What could
                        hpossibly have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, in this particular instance, as I recall, it had to do with a
                    lecture that was given and was reported to the congressman as being anti-Semitic
                    in its tone. And since at that time the area studies and the lectures that were
                    given were sort of under my jurisdiction. As it turned out, Loy Henderson knew
                    the lecturer very well and could very quickly see what the problem was, and
                    asked him to tone it down a little bit.</p>
                <p>Q: We're talking about this, that there would be two subjects, particularly
                    during this period and one that would continue almost to today, that you find
                    you have true believers, not within the Department, but among your monitors -
                    Congress, other people - one would be on Israel and there have been accusations
                    without end that our Foreign Service officers are anti-Semitic, that they're
                    pro-Arab. And the other would be on China.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Add on communism generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and communism generally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Some of the problems came up from that point of view where somebody
                    reported in the congress that they'd heard something at the Foreign Service
                    Institute that they didn't agree with, and having to do with religion,
                    communism—not just anti-Semitic, really religion in general. These were
                    sensitive issues. The way in which we dealt with those...I talked this over with
                    Loy and he agreed. The way to do this was for me to ask the congressman, either
                    himself or to send a member of his staff, come and sit in on the lectures with
                    the understanding that they would sit through the series so they could get in
                    context what was being said, and what was being taught. And generally this
                    worked out quite well, as an approach to the problem and we actually gained some
                    friends on the Hill by doing that.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have a problem? Here we are, particularly during this period, with a
                    policy of strong support, mainly for domestic reasons, of Israel, at the same
                    time we're dealing with a big Arab world which detested this policy. And you
                    would invite lecturers who wanted Foreign Service officers both to understand
                    the policy, but also to understand the Arab world. I can see this would be so
                    sensitive that it would be almost impossible to deal with.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Well, it was sensitive but by putting it into a broader
                    perspective, we were able to diffuse most of the problems, not all of them. For
                    example, on China one of the things that disturbed me greatly, almost to the
                    point of resigning from the Foreign Service, was that the Department of State
                    wanted the Institute to clear all of its speakers that it invited before the
                    invitations were extended. I'll use a name here. When it came to John Fairbanks,
                    the preeminent China scholar, we were told no, you can't hire him because he's
                    on McCarthy's list. That was the sort of thing that I had difficulty dealing
                    with on a personal basis, having high respect for Fairbanks and knowing that he
                    was not what McCarthy had intimated. These were the sort of things that we had
                    to go through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Fairbanks talk to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: He did originally and later on, but there was a period where he was
                    blocked. Not only was he blocked, and I can understand the other one perhaps a
                    little better than this one. Owen Lattimore, who was the preeminent expert on
                    Mongolia, for example. He's was one that we had wanted to bring in. As a matter
                    of fact he had been a consultant to the Department on Mongolia. He was another
                    one that was blocked. I've forgotten some of the others but these two stand
                    out.</p>
                <p>Q: As we worked our way through the McCarthy period...I mean there was an initial
                    period where you had these two jokers, is the only word I can think of, Cohn and
                    Shinn sounds like a comedy team, which in a way it was, going around Europe
                    taking books out of USIS libraries. One, were you hit by that particular thing,
                    what books we could have in the library, and what books were recommended?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes. We were hit but at that particular point we were at such a low
                    budgetary ebb we weren't really acquiring new books. It was from that period,
                    and particularly I think because of Sputnik and the fact that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what Sputnik was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Sputnik was the Russian satellite, the first satellite that was put
                    up to orbit the earth. This, in fact, caused a big stir in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I've forgotten the exact date, but suddenly it appeared as though
                    the Soviets were ten feet tall. They had jumped ahead of us on getting a
                    satellite in orbit, so we began to look at all the other things that were coming
                    out. There was a book out then by the title of The Ugly American. That suddenly
                    attracted a lot of attention because it purported that the Americans were way
                    behind the Soviets in terms of their relationships with people in foreign
                    countries, language, understanding the cultures, etc. It affected the way in
                    which the Congress began to look at training, as well as the Department of
                    State, and taking advantage of that situation that Loy Henderson, and others in
                    the Department, decided to move and to move aggressively on the issue of
                    training.</p>
                <p>I remember Loy asking me at one point whether we knew what skills we had in the
                    Foreign Service at posts. Do we know at posts who can speak French in France,
                    etc., and around the world. I said, no, I don't think we do, that's a question
                    for Personnel. We said if you would draw him up a message to be sent out
                    worldwide to get information on this, we'll do it. I said, you have to
                    understand also that this will be self appraisal, people saying what they think
                    their own competence is. He said, that's a good place to start. We went out with
                    that and found there was really a very big gap between competence in the
                    language and assignments in the field. What can we do about it? Well there are a
                    lot of logistic problems if we wait for people to come back to Washington to
                    train them to go out. It's going to take a long time. He said, let's not wait. I
                    said, the alternative is to set up facilities either at posts or central schools
                    overseas in a crash program that would pull people in who do not have the
                    language proficiency in the country and train them. The place to start is in the
                    world languages where the demand is the greatest. Loy Henderson said, do it. So
                    we proceeded, and I think it was 1957 that on a crash basis set up schools, one
                    in Nice, one in Frankfurt, one in Mexico City to deal with the so-called world
                    language shortage to train people. Personnel was horrified. The idea of pulling
                    people away from their posts when the posts were screaming for more staff, and
                    sending them off to school. They had hoped it would be a matter of just a couple
                    weeks. Its not going to work that way. If you're serious about it, it should be
                    four months, if you want to get them really up to snuff, three months at the
                    minimum, and if you have a three month period, you ought to build up the follow
                    up at the posts so they can continue their training when they get back because
                    probably most of them would start off from scratch and are not going to get to
                    the 3 level in three months. You have a better chance of doing that in the
                    field, than doing it back here.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We knew there would be opposition, particularly from Mr. Rooney. As it turned out
                    there was. Loy Henderson was willing to accept that and to go ahead with it. He
                    had enough clout in the Department to make it stick through the Personnel
                    system, and we pulled people in to all three of these schools for three months,
                    12 weeks of very intensive training. I was involved in going out and deciding
                    where the schools should be located, and setting them up. I did not like the
                    idea of setting up a school in Nice. I knew that would attract a lot of negative
                    comment, particularly from Congressman Rooney, but there were reasons why they
                    thought Nice was the place to do it. We had a large building there and so rent
                    would be free, a very nice estate to locate and that would accommodate the
                    training program. That worked, and in a very short period of time we put a large
                    number of people through this program, and sent back to the French, German,
                    Spanish speaking posts. This was really a sort of unprecedented focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The German training was where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Frankfurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Was in Mexico City. Interesting, I fought Mexico City, but I was
                    overruled. I wanted to have it set up outside the large metropolitan area, there
                    were too many distractions within the city. I had located a school in the
                    countryside that was not in use that we could rent. There were accommodations,
                    they were not luxurious accommodations, but they were livable. Review of the
                    plan to set it up there was turned down on the basis it would be hard to get
                    people to go to a place like that, even for three months. So it was put in
                    Mexico City, which we did. It worked reasonably well.</p>
                <p>This was also a time when under the National Defense Education Act, Title IV, the
                    government was required to identify language needs and language skills. And as a
                    result of that we had to develop a testing system. It was also obvious that we
                    needed standards in testing if we were going to try to get people up to a level
                    that was considered important so far as their function in the Foreign Service.
                    That system got underway. I think we talked about that in an earlier
                    session.</p>
                <p>But as part of the buildup we also put regional language supervisors in the
                    field, and this was not only in the world language areas, but elsewhere also, in
                    the Middle East and in Asia. But in Asia it was primarily done through the field
                    schools that we had then in Taipei, Taiwan, and in Tokyo. The people who'd been
                    assisted with the post language training program. In other words a follow-up on
                    the training that would be given in the United States. Enrollments in the post
                    language training program, just to give you an example, increased from about 600
                    in 1953 to 4500 by 1960, a tremendous jump.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>In addition to that the Congress began to move and in an amendment to the Foreign
                    Service Act, the amendment came in 1960, the Congress stated that it was, I'll
                    read this, “was the policy of the Congress that chiefs of mission and Foreign
                    Service officers shall have to the maximum practical extent among their
                    qualifications a useful knowledge of the principal language, or dialect, of the
                    country in which they are to serve, and knowledge and understanding of history,
                    the culture, the economics, political institutions, and interests of such
                    country and its people.” A very broad and sort of mandate statement of principle
                    and policy. That was followed by another Senate policy which required the
                    Department to designate language as central positions, and the level of language
                    proficiency that was required, and to report annually to the Congress on its
                    compliance. You can imagine Personnel was not very happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having your contacts in Congress helping them
                        draw uthese plans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Fulbright and Mansfield were probably the principal people that
                    were pushing this. Both of these people had called me up to the Senate to talk
                    about what they wanted to do, and what the problems really were in the Foreign
                    Service. I remember a couple of these sessions that I had with them and it was
                    clear that they were serious. This was also a time when, and particularly
                    Fulbright, was not held in very high esteem in the Department because of his
                    stand on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Fulbright and Mansfield were serious
                        abouthis. Was this done over the dead body of Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: To some extent it was. But the advantage at that particular point
                    was that we had Loy Henderson's support. And the other positive thing was that
                    we had a director, a business man, who was able to get the budget up and he
                    faced a lot of problems with Congressman Rooney to the point where Mr. Rooney at
                    one point on the floor of the House of Representatives called on the floor to
                    have him fired.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any way to coopt Rooney? We had almost Rooney handlers who used to
                    take him around on trips. He liked to go to Rome and Paris and people sat with
                    him and fed him a lot of liquor. Were you able to get anybody to sort of get to
                    him to make him understand what was going on? Or was this just a fun thing for
                    our political expediencies?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: I think it was a fun thing for him. Plus he had a constituent that
                    he'd hoped to get some business for, Berlitz. He was probably responsible for, I
                    think, closing down our language schools. But they had pretty well done the
                    emergency crisis job. He made a visit to Nice, a place he liked to go to. So
                    under his pressure the school there folded. But the advantage that I had in
                    trying to move ahead in organizing this program on an emergency crash basis, was
                    the support first of Loy Henderson...not the support, but really the push from
                    Fulbright and Mansfield in the Senate, and the way in which they were able to in
                    a way force the Department to do what it didn't want to do but reluctantly they
                    did. And getting the budget for this. The result really of the congressional
                    policy statement was that language became much more important, not only the
                    world languages, but the so-called hard languages. This put a real burden on the
                    Institute because materials for advance training in many of these languages did
                    not exist, or were quite unsatisfactory. And it required a major effort within
                    the Institute for research and development of teaching materials, as well as
                    teaching methods. Trying to not only keep up but to get ahead in the field. We
                    had to recruit, and at that particular time it was not easy to persuade people
                    from the academic community to come and work for the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking now about the Vietnam period, are we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We're talking even earlier. Part of the reluctance was because
                    McCarthy's attack on the State Department, and the academics did not want to
                    subject themselves to that sort of a situation. I was lucky because about the
                    same time that we had to start expanding, the Army Language School in Monterey
                    was contracting and was becoming less academic in its focus, not as experimental
                    as they had been. The dean and two of his senior linguists wanted to leave, so I
                    recruited them and brought them to the State Department. I made the dean my
                    deputy, and the other two moved in to a hard language field where we had had
                    shortage. We had really a top notch staff. If you looked anywhere in the country
                    in academia we could match them and stand tall with the quality of linguists
                    that we had at that particular time.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, you also still had this thrust which was, I guess, different than the
                    academic world. The academic world was still trying to turn out researchers
                    which meant people could read the language, but didn't have to speak it. There
                    wasn't that much of a call, was there for speaking a language?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: No. And the National Defense Education Act hadn't really kicked in
                    so far as changing things very much in the academic community. But as a result
                    of this, by 1965, the Institute had published through the Government Printing
                    Office [GPO] materials in 30 different languages, and most of these had tapes to
                    go with them, and we worked out arrangements with the GPO whereby these could be
                    sold to the public. So this began to have an affect in terms of the academic
                    community where they were able to get the materials that were produced at an
                    advanced level. And it began to change some of the instruction patterns in a few
                    of the academic centers, not many but in a few. But it was sort of a wedge, if
                    you will, of influence in the language teaching and in the academic world. At
                    the same time the testing system, the S/R testing scale, the proficiency testing
                    scale, became of more interest in the academic community. They would send people
                    to the Institute to observe the testing procedures. We on several occasions sent
                    teams of people out to several of the academic institutions, particularly when
                    they were having workshops in dealing with language proficiency, because there
                    was increased pressure on the academic world to begin to produce people who
                    could practically use the language in everyday situations. But my point here is
                    that I was very lucky during this period to have a lot of good support to move a
                    program ahead probably in an unprecedented way, so far as the State Department
                    was concerned.</p>
                <p>Q: You need somebody of the stature of Loy Henderson who was there for a long
                    time and looked upon the system as an institution. I mean a whole professional
                    Foreign Service as opposed to somebody who comes in, often a political or even a
                    professional who comes in for a couple of years and make quick fix and on their
                    way.</p>
                <p>Did you find as the program developed and the National Defense Education Act
                    kicked in, were we able, we the Foreign Service, able to start finding more
                    language qualified people out there who could be recruited for Foreign Service.
                    Because when I came in it was almost a given that you got over your probation by
                    studying a foreign language, which I did, while you were in the service. Were
                    you beginning to see this?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: It took quite a while for that to kick in, but it was one of the
                    points that the advisory committee, under Mr. Wriston, thought we ought to push.
                    But it became pretty clear that if you had the language requirement before
                    coming in, you'd be getting people who had been primarily majors in foreign
                    languages, and the Department felt, and I think rightly so, that they couldn't
                    put that much emphasis on a pre-service requirement, particularly when you could
                    do it after they got into the service. So while there were tests that were
                    given, and records were kept of the language aptitude, as well as the language
                    proficiency, the plan really was that they would get the language of their first
                    post of assignment, and they would be required to get to a certain level. I
                    think it was S-2 [speaking level 2] to get off the probation.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Q: Of course, there was the other problem, that if you went for people who
                    studied language you were going to end up with maybe dealing more with the East
                    Coast elite colleges because many of the other schools just weren't teach it.
                    And you would not get the geographic and the class diversity that we were
                    looking for.</p>
                <p>I had a question on the Vietnam training during the '60s. How were you relating
                    to the other agencies that were using this program, particularly the military,
                    the AID. Did they feel you were doing the right thing?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We were under a mandate which came from, I guess, the White House
                    that there should be training for all agency people going into the CORDS
                    program...I've forgotten what CORDS stands for [Editor: Civil Operations and
                    Revolutionary Development Support]. And the Institute was instructed to set up a
                    program in support. We had to develop language materials in Vietnamese because
                    there was not much pressure to do training. But it reached the point where the
                    enrollments in Vietnamese to the Foreign Service Institute were higher than in
                    any other language, French, Spanish, and by a considerable margin. We set up
                    basically a separate unit just to manage that program. We had a unique linguist,
                    a lady, Eleanor Jordan, whose expertise was in Japanese and we gave her the task
                    of getting that program developed, which she did very effectively.</p>
                <p>There were problems along the way with the Vietnamese training program to a large
                    extent because for a few years, Personnel decreed that all junior officers were
                    supposed to spend their first assignment in CORDS. There were some -
                    particularly those within the State Department, the FSOs - who didn't want to go
                    and would protest by not doing their work in training. Of course, policy was
                    lack of progress in language training meant leaving early for Vietnam. Some, of
                    course, did resign and left the service because they were opposed to being sent
                    to Vietnam for CORDS.</p>
                <p>Q: By the '60s had you developed an equivalent to a language training matrix? In
                    other words, you had a way of doing this so all of a sudden you're up against
                    teaching Ukrainian. You can take the basic pattern for almost any language, put
                    it into this, and have the equivalent dialogues except put it in a different
                    language and this type of thing. Or did one have to be created from the
                    beginning?</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: The general approach that we took was that you created from the
                    beginning. We wanted to stimulate, one of the things I was interested in, I was
                    to stimulate creativity on the part of the professional staff, and to give them
                    the freedom to try out new things and new approaches. We had some very creative
                    people that came in at that particular time, and gave them generally a pretty
                    free rein. There were some mistakes that were made along the way, things that
                    didn't work out, but by and large it moved the Institute's school of languages
                    probably to the forefront of language teaching facilities anywhere. That was a
                    personal satisfaction, but one that would not have been achieved, as I said,
                    without the support of Loy Henderson, supporters in the Congress, and
                    circumstance at that time. I've always been grateful that I had a chance at that
                    particular point to make my contribution with that kind of support.</p>
                <p>Q: In area studies, in universities one way to get the intellectual juices
                    running often you want to get basically provocative or controversial people to
                    get up and give a lecture or a talk, for this, that, in a way you'd like to have
                    our students are going to communist countries one up against a good solid
                    dialectical Marxist who can give and take with the best of them to give them
                    some practice. Having them feel how a foreigner would react to them. Were you
                    able to develop anything of this nature?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We had a member of the staff, not in the language school or in the
                    area part of the language program, who specialized on talking about communism.
                    He lectured at almost every program, in every class that came through. One of
                    the things that he did was to simulate, or have someone simulate a Soviet person
                    talking about their goals, their procedures, etc. This was sort of an
                    institutionalized function within the Institute. When it came to area studies
                    associated with language training, we tried to have at least weekly, and
                    sometimes several times a week in the afternoons, a block of time devoted to the
                    country or the area associated with the language the students were learning.
                    Therefore, we would bring in academics from the outside, as well as from the
                    Department, and from the other agencies of the government. We rather
                    systematically go through the history, the culture, institutions, religions and
                    things of this sort. We had some rather remarkable people that we were able to
                    bring in - Joseph Campbell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain who Joseph Campbell is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Joseph Campbell was the author I guess of a series of books on
                    culture, religion and myth, focused heavily on myth [Editor: In his The Masks of
                    God, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949) and Myths to Live By (1972), Campbell
                    talks about the symbolic clothing in which cultures dress their historic
                    experiences]. Very well known. He later did a series for public television, an
                    interview show entitled The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers. He used to come
                    regularly and talked about not only myth culture, but religions, particularly
                    Indonesia, the Middle East also. Margaret Mead would [lecture] on the cultural
                    side.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably the best known American anthropologist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We were able to attract people of that [caliber].</p>
                <p>Q: What about other departments. I'm thinking particularly of Commerce,
                    Agriculture, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and Labor, which send
                    attach�s abroad. Were they interested in tapping in to the resources of the
                    Foreign Service Institute?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes and no. There was a fair amount of turf struggle. Each agency
                    wanted its own training program. They felt that they were the only true source
                    of understanding of the agency's function, and there was reluctance to send
                    people to central training programs. Perhaps it would be useful here to talk a
                    little bit about the concepts that became entrenched in the development of the
                    Foreign Service Institute. I'll put these mostly in the context of the period in
                    which I was involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: In 1965 I left the language school and was assigned as the acting
                    director of the Institute. From 1965 to 1976 I was either acting or director or
                    associate director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll say from '65 to '76 you were at the hands of
                        control, oone hand away from the control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right. One of the concepts that we were working on, and I
                    think became established during that period, was the concept of continuing
                    education within the Foreign Service, and considering the times in which we were
                    in, the rapidity of change in societies, etc., that prior education, knowledge
                    was not sufficient, that you needed to be updated, and perhaps in many areas
                    acquire new knowledge. The Wriston committee had suggested that one year out of
                    ten, or three years in a 30 year career should perhaps be spent in training, and
                    it should be evenly distributed. It was the result of the Wriston
                    recommendations that the Senior Seminar in foreign policy was established. That
                    became firmly established as a pattern [for senior officers].</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>A mid-career course was also established. That was one of Wriston's pets I think.
                    He thought there ought to be a mandated mid-career training program. That was
                    tried in several different ways, and never really caught on. I think there were
                    two reasons: one, the reluctance of officers at that stage in their career when
                    they were climbing and competing, to take time out for a serious training
                    program, particularly when they were being taken out for language training and
                    other things at the same time. The other problem was that...it was really a
                    problem with Personnel. They were mandated at one point to fill classes on a
                    regular basis, scheduled classes for people at mid-career. And what they
                    generally do is to take people they didn't know what to do with, and put them
                    into the training program. And people who were concerned about their careers at
                    that particular point felt they were being put on the shelf when they were put
                    into training. The idea didn't take well.</p>
                <p>Q: I was in Personnel and we used to have a corridor word for these. These were
                    called training officers. These were people that bureaus felt they could spare.
                    We had some people who went to course after course.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Yes. Well, it wasn't just a Personnel program. The bureaus were
                    involved, because the bureaus were assessed certain quotas to assign to
                    training. Of course, they might think it that role. In any case, I called a halt
                    to that program when I became director. It wasn't working and I felt it wasn't
                    worth the effort and time that was being put into it. We'd have to approach
                    mid-career training in a different way. That was to take some of the subject
                    matter that we had put into the mid-career course, and to give it in short
                    segments - one week, two week seminars - where it would be easier to pull people
                    out and more or less on an interest basis, and on the basis of what they were
                    currently doing in the Department. That seemed to work a little bit better and
                    at the same time gave us the opportunity to look ahead. One of the concepts of
                    training that I think became established during this period was the concept of
                    looking ahead to future needs, not dealing only with the current and immediate
                    problems that we were faced with. This was on the assumption that when an
                    officer comes in to the Foreign Service you have to think about what you need
                    him to have by the time he reaches the senior level. You need to begin to
                    prepare all along the way, particularly if you're able to establish this concept
                    of continuing education, to begin to build towards the future when they will
                    become senior policy making officers.</p>
                <p>We tried several things, one of which I'm particularly proud, although it failed,
                    and I'll show you here. I'm holding up here a poster with a slogan that
                    “pollution is a world problem.”</p>
                <p>Q: It has a picture of the earth with things swirling around and saying
                    “Environmental Assembly, West Auditorium, Department of State, April 22, 1970.”
                    The poster said this would be a four hour program.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was about the time of the first Earth Day. There was beginning
                    to be stirring within the country recognition of a problem. Some of us thought
                    that pollution would become a major problem down the road, and we better begin
                    to pay a little attention to it on an international basis. It had no boundaries.
                    I talked with the science adviser to the Secretary and the two of us went to see
                    the Secretary and suggested that we hold a symposium, and that we invite not
                    only people from the agencies and they're listed here. I think USIS, AID, ACDA,
                    Peace Corps as well as the Department, and the diplomatic community, ask them to
                    come, and we'd bring in some really distinguished people to talk about this
                    issue with an international focus. So far as I know, this was probably the first
                    occasion where this was done. The Secretary seemed interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William Rogers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: That's right, seemed interested. We said, would you be willing to
                    kick it off. I'll have to check on that. He called back several days later
                    saying he was sorry but that he could not. He later told me that the White House
                    had felt that this was not the time to launch this sort of thing, and this sort
                    of initiative, that there were other things that were far more important. But we
                    went ahead with the program. The fact that we couldn't get the Secretary to
                    issue the invitations to the- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, it did initiate into the training program and we followed up with
                    that in our training programs having short sessions on, not only environmental
                    problems, but a whole range of new issues. This concept of looking ahead, I
                    think, is something that was implanted by the Institute and is continuing and
                    important during a period of change.Full time intensive training was another
                    concept that I think has been pretty firmly established now. We'd had enough
                    experience with language training using the intensive approach that we were
                    competent in extending this to other fields. Along with this, the idea of
                    training to meet unmet needs within the Department was beginning to be
                    recognized. It took quite a while for the focus and the need for economists, and
                    economic background, to be recognized in the Department. Attention to the issue
                    was called by Wriston during his Wriston period, to a shortage of that and the
                    future needs. Recruitment was not bringing in enough people with that kind of
                    background, and the field of economics was changing so that what had been taught
                    was no longer valid. We went to universities to see what they had to offer in
                    terms of sending people to universities. The response that we got from the
                    universities generally was, send us your people for a couple of years and we'll
                    make economists out of them. The Department could not afford that. We decided to
                    try intensive training, which we did, which worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you develop that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Brought in two economists, John Sprout from Georgetown University
                    was one of them. And we had some within the Foreign Service also. We set up a
                    highly intensive course to take people with little or no background in
                    economics, or maybe with undergraduate courses, but it was antiquated and no
                    longer useful. The idea was that within a period of six months you'd produce
                    somebody who could function effectively as an economist and who could speak the
                    language in terms of dealing with the international scene, professionals in the
                    field of economics. That worked so well that not only did our students measure
                    up well on the exams that were given by universities for not only undergraduate
                    majors, but graduate record exams. Our students measured up very well against
                    those.</p>
                <p>So the concept of intensive training we then began to think about applying that
                    to administration because the Department said, we've got problems in
                    administration, which they did, management. What could training do about that?
                    And increasingly the Department was coming to the Institute saying, we've got
                    problems. Can you set up a course in this, that, and the other thing? Generally,
                    it was fragmented, did not have the concept in how you develop people in all of
                    these fields through a full career. But the concept of intensive training took a
                    hold.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you run across any problems with this economic intensive training?
                    Actually it's everywhere, but at the same time you were goring a very big odds
                    and that is, you can turn out the equivalent of a person with almost the ability
                    to deal at the Master's level in six months with bright people, I would think
                    the universities would be kind of unhappy about this.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: They were initially, but they began to take some notice of this
                    when we gave our students their exams. Of course, they would come back and say,
                    this is a highly select group. And we admit this was a fairly highly select
                    group. And the arguments that the universities generally put up was that in
                    fields of this sort it requires time to absorb, and that it should be
                    interrelated with other training, other educational fields, and not taught in
                    isolation. Its not in the real world, and its not that way. There's some
                    validity, of course, to that argument.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>But it seemed to some of us in the Institute that not only was this useful and
                    necessary in a time of rapid change, and with knowledge itself was changing, and
                    where you had to sort of recalibrate, or retrain people in fields that they once
                    were competent in but were no longer competent just to keep up with the rapidity
                    of change. And that this was one way in which you could meet these requirements
                    in a relatively short period of time, and put them back into the real world
                    where they could function much better. I believe now that many of the business
                    firms, etc.,—well, the military has followed this concept for some time, how you
                    train somebody to do a particularly small job very intensively and put him into
                    a job. But business has begun now to focus on this as way of updating people,
                    bringing them in to new technology, etc., to highly intensive training, taking
                    them out of operations for a while and training them. So I think this concept,
                    which was not really originally developed within the Institute, but was put into
                    practice and demonstrated as valid and effective. It has had some affect on
                    changes in the whole training educational pattern within the country.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at the cadre of officers who were coming in...let me make a
                    proposition and see how you react to it. We're talking about the 1990s. One of
                    the great problems that is faced, I think, throughout our system, is that the
                    people don't write very well. But earlier on I would have thought that you would
                    have been working on creating a cadre of people with good writing skills. I
                    always assumed that somebody could write when they came as a supervising
                    officer. I was wondering whether that was the assumption at this time? How do
                    you feel about it?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was one of the things that came up time and again with Wriston
                    and his advisory committee met deploring the state of communication. And not
                    only in the Department - and apparently Wriston had read a number of reports and
                    things of this sort - but also in the universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is not a new manifestation at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was not. There was discussion at various times on whether we
                    could do an intensive writing program. We gave up on that one, and preferred to
                    put that into other programs requiring the short intensive programs on some
                    particular subject where you would require the officers to write reports. But it
                    didn't work.</p>
                <p>Q: What is the problem with teaching logical writing? I recall reading somewhere
                    and somebody I interviewed said there was this course where you counted out the
                    number of adjectives, or something like that, and you came up with...I mean
                    there were mechanistic ways of doing this. Were you looking at this sort of
                    thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We were looking at that sort of thing. We brought in some of these
                    programs that were advertised as being able to improve your writing skills.
                    Basically on that particular skill, as well as on public speaking, expressing
                    yourself, and increasingly that was becoming important also as television, etc.,
                    public media was used more. I guess my response to that was that in a sense we
                    failed on that, but that it really is the responsibility of early education. It
                    has to start very early as a pattern in education where there's more
                    requirements for expressing yourself clearly in writing. But part of it is also
                    the thinking process. It's more than putting it down on paper. You have to think
                    clearly before you can write clearly.</p>
                <p>Q: This, of course, has great pertinence today. I mean, you met the monster and
                    it was too much for you. What about things such as what we call trade craft. I
                    mean there are things like negotiating skills which is now big. Were you looking
                    at that? Also, how the Foreign Service officer whose often been dealing abroad
                    is plunked into Washington, finds himself the Department of State representative
                    up against essentially the civil servants of other agencies who have been doing
                    this for years, and the State Department guy may be bright but he's never been
                    up against this. Were you able to teach negotiating skills during your time?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We certainly thought about it, and we tried to get it into some of
                    the short intensive courses that we offered. There's another thing here that I
                    perhaps should mention and that is the concept of interagency training, and the
                    concept of familiarizing yourself with your own society. When you serve a good
                    part of your career overseas, and you come back and things have changed back
                    here, you're dealing, as you say, with people in different agencies and
                    organizations back here. You need to know a little bit more about the
                    functioning of your own society. There were several ways that we approached that
                    through these short intensive seminars, but also in bringing interagency groups
                    together, and exposing them to the points of view of the different agencies, the
                    private sector. This was certainly true in the Senior Seminar that focused
                    heavily on reacquaintance with the American society that [the senior officer]
                    had to represent.</p>
                <p>[But here is another story]. During the Kennedy administration, I think, Kennedy
                    scared a bit by the way in which Khrushchev said, we're going to confront
                    you...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about '61 at the Vienna meeting. Kennedy was
                        basicallbested by Khrushchev.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Where Khrushchev, I guess, not only intimated, Kennedy but said
                    Moscow would pursue its policy of liberation around the world. And insurgency
                    was a tactic that they would use. So Kennedy came back, and in looking for ways
                    to respond, settled on counterinsurgency. Bobby Kennedy tackled this issue, as
                    well as General Maxwell Taylor. Again, they turned to the State Department and
                    the Foreign Service Institute and said, we would like you to put on a
                    counterinsurgency program which would be interagency, and it would be required
                    that all officers in these agencies at a certain level, and certain functions,
                    shall attend. And Bobby Kennedy and General Taylor were there to see that it
                    happened that way. The Institute assumed the administrative support for it, but
                    it developed as an independent program, and was set up in independent quarters
                    and there was an independent interagency committee that supervised this. But one
                    of the things that happened as the whole concept of counterinsurgency began to
                    fade was that counterinsurgency doctrine seemed to have less and less relevance
                    to the problems that we were dealing with. That raised the question what to do
                    with this established program that had been set in motion by Kennedy. George
                    Allan, who was then the director of the Institute, thought that the time had
                    come to change this, and as director of the Institute he was chairman of the
                    interagency committee that was supposed to be supervising this. There was strong
                    opposition in certain quarters for this, particularly in the military who found
                    this interagency a device to get their interests...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially counterinsurgency was often time very
                        heavilweighted toward the military, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...and the intelligence. I inherited the task of dealing with this,
                    and assigned to head the organization was Howard Hugrude, who had been a deputy
                    under secretary of Defense. We got acquainted, and we talked about the program,
                    he came to the conclusion that the time had come to change and that we could do
                    it gradually. He had contacts in the military and in the intelligence agencies
                    that made this possible. And over a period of time it became a short senior
                    seminar focused more on the United States, and on domestic problems and how they
                    affected the international affairs. But also continuing a segment on the threat
                    of insurgencies as they appeared around the world. Gradually the nature of this
                    seminar changed, it continued as an interagency training program but it brought
                    senior level people from different agencies together so they got acquainted with
                    each other, and they talked and there was follow-up in terms of personal
                    relationships that were established through that program. That was of interest
                    in several ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The Vietnam training program was interagency program, so when new interagency
                    problems came up, specifically as we mentioned, the drug war, [FSI became
                    involved. One day,] I was called down to the White House on very short notice to
                    talk about what could be done in training [to fight] the drug war. There were
                    turf problems between the different agencies. My suggestion, which was taken up,
                    was that they establish a mandated program within the agencies that [dealt with
                    the drug program to supply] people. That they be trained together, and we would
                    get each agency to come in and talk about, and describe what they were doing,
                    and [their agency's approach]. From that we would try to [encourage mutual]
                    understanding, and we would get a personal relationship going between people
                    working in this field. So the Vietnam training program, counterinsurgency, drug
                    war, these things began to come to the Institute as interagency training
                    programs. From my own personal point of view it seems to me that this was a
                    practical, working solution to some of the coordinating problems that the
                    government was having when specific [interagency] problems came up on which sort
                    of immediate action was required.</p>
                <p>Q: This, of course, is one of the big bureaucratic problems. There is a
                    difference between official contact between heads of an agency or heads of a
                    bureau, as opposed to somebody on a first name basis calling and saying, “We
                    have a problem.” It becomes a solvable problem instead of an interagency
                    issue.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: In a way I was quite amazed in meeting some of these people at the
                    end of their programs to find out how surprised they were to [realize] what the
                    other agencies were doing in this field, and what the overall problems were.
                    [They] seemed very appreciative of the opportunity to participate in a program
                    of this sort. I don't know what's happened to the drug war now. My point here is
                    that the concept of interagency training for specific purposes, I think, has
                    been established and is probably in one form or another a continuing thing
                    within the Institute.</p>
                <p>It was important for the Department of State also. Let me back up just a little
                    bit. [Our embassies overseas house a variety of agencies.] The concept of the
                    country team being under the State Department and specifically under the
                    ambassador [was developed to] bring about the coordination of this ever
                    increasing number of other agencies that were sending people to our missions
                    overseas. It seemed to me that, if the Department of State were serious about
                    trying to form a country team, [then it] ought to insist on having the people
                    that go into the country team trained together so that they know each other,
                    talk to each other, and they'd learned about the Department of State. [I see]
                    the Institute as the place to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I, as a retired Foreign Service
                        officer, always ran into - and I think every Foreign Service officer has
                        this - I ran into it just a couple of months ago... I was in Bosnia as an
                        election observer and somebody remarked to me, “Gee, you're from the State
                        Department but you're a regular guy.” There's always been this idea that
                        somehow the Foreign Service is snobbish and doesn't really understand the
                        United States. Part of the solution is just to expose other people to us to
                        find out that we're sort of real people. Did you find that this was part of
                        your effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was part of it, that's right. Of course, that [stereotype
                    faded] as the Foreign Service became more democratized in its selection of
                    people. You [recruited] people that were a little less stuffy.</p>
                <p>Q: What about the Senior Seminar? I was in the 17th Senior Seminar. I found it an
                    excellent program but the one area I felt it failed in was that the military did
                    not send their top officers there. These were very nice people, but in later
                    life these would not become the generals, the admirals that you could call up
                    and deal with. Whereas our people who went to the War Colleges would have
                    friends for almost life, but they would also reach high positions, particularly
                    in the military services, and they could call on them. I never ran across one of
                    our military colleagues again. How about recruitment in the use of the Senior
                    Seminar?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: This was an issue that was discussed many times with Personnel, and
                    it applied not only to the Senior Seminar but to other training programs. [You
                    can't get away from the thought] that, if you wanted these to be really
                    productive, you had to follow up with appropriate assignments, which meant that
                    you had to bring into these programs people who had the potential to move into
                    the top levels, and then you had to move them into the top levels. The concept
                    that we were trying to get established on this was that if someone was assigned
                    to the Senior Seminar in foreign policy, this was a sign that he was on his way.
                    And that he or she almost certainly get a better assignment as they moved out.
                    There were problems from the Personnel point of view, and I acknowledge this.
                    Within the service it's hard to plan a year ahead as to just what job is going
                    to be open, and there are many pressures and demands also on filling these
                    slots. It's not an easy function from a Personnel point of view to plan that far
                    ahead and to carry through on it.</p>
                <p>The military, on the other hand, and the other agencies, too... The only pressure
                    that you could bring on them [came from the argument] that, look, you're
                    exposing yourself to a large number of other senior officers. You ought to put
                    your best foot forward, put your best people into these programs. We would have
                    meetings with other agencies trying to do the same thing and ran into some of
                    the same problems that we did with our own Personnel office. You can gauge from
                    what I've said here that there were many areas where there was tension between
                    training and Personnel, and many of them were understandable and real.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Q: With the departure of Loy Henderson and [the establishment] of the new Under
                    Secretaries for Management, during this '65 to '76 period, did you sense a
                    lessening of the clout of the Foreign Service Institute?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: On the one hand, yes. And on the other hand, the Department and
                    other agencies [increasingly] were turning, and even the White House, was
                    turning to the Institute for training to deal with some of the problems that
                    they faced. The problems that we faced were really [due to] competing [trends].
                    At the same time that there was increased interest in training, and continuing
                    education and training, etc., the Department was faced with [budget] cuts. It
                    seemed almost like an annual event that you do more with less, and the Institute
                    is going through that right now again. The different responsible people dealt
                    differently with this. Training, I did feel, did not have the priority that it
                    deserved within the Department itself. But the problems were understandable.
                    William Macomber was Under Secretary. He was interested in training but he had
                    so many other problems, at least one sensed this, on his desk at the time that
                    it was really hard to get his attention. Eagleburger came up through the system.
                    He was supportive of training.</p>
                <p>Q: But his support may not have been wholehearted. I saw him one time in the
                    elevator and he said, Stu, what the hell are you doing in the Senior
                    Seminar?</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: Just to touch on a couple of other these [issues that, I think,
                    fall into the rubric of] training. You asked about training [for negotiation
                    skills] and things of that sort. We began to experiment quite early in the use
                    of case studies and role playing, and found that we had to develop many of our
                    own cases and [materials]. That was given a boost when we had resources to do
                    that, say in the Vietnam training program. We had several role playing
                    [scenarios] that we worked out that took the students off-site to play these
                    games, and they seemed quite effective. Case studies, we were pushed by the
                    academic community to do more in the way of a case study approach, and that was
                    good. I think that has taken hold over the years, particularly since I've
                    left.</p>
                <p>The role of wives. This was a problem that I struggled with for a long time
                    without very much success, and largely because [Congressman] Rooney at one point
                    said, not one cent of the appropriated funds shall be spent on the training of
                    people who are not employed by the government, and that applies to the
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the wives.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: We're talking about the wives at that particular point. And yet
                    increasingly the feeling was that they were such an important part of any team,
                    family [team], that went overseas, that it was critical that they receive
                    training. With language training, we devised a system which we stretched,
                    whereby if we didn't have to create a new class, we would let wives sit in. We
                    would sometimes make the class particularly small so we could add more people to
                    it. We started a wives training program, a seminar here that was
                    supported...I've forgotten how it was supported budgetarily, but we know that we
                    got it underway and we somehow got around the prohibition not to spend money on
                    the training of wives. This was very slow in coming and we never really licked
                    the problem during my time.</p>
                <p>Q: It was something you understood was a resource problem, but it was also part
                    of the problem of essentially getting Congress to back it up.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: ...back it up with resources, and you couldn't do somof these
                    things without the resources to do it.</p>
                <p>Just a couple of other points that have to do with things that I think are pretty
                    well established by this time. One of these is [our] relationships with academic
                    institutions. Originally that was very slow in getting off the ground. There
                    were two ways of [making connections]. One was by sending Foreign Service
                    officers out to academic institutions for training in various fields which not
                    only exposed our officers to the academic world, but exposed the academic world
                    to the Foreign Service. This was useful. We extended [that program] with the
                    idea of sending out officers as diplomats-in-residence, mostly senior people who
                    were between assignments and needed a good place to keep abreast, or people who
                    had ideas that they wanted to pursue in an academic setting and then bring the
                    results of this back to the Department. We felt the way to do this was to
                    [establish a] diplomat-in-residence program, [which was], I think, quite
                    successful. At least [that was the conclusion I drew] as I went out to visit
                    some of these people on location, and saw the reaction of the institutions to
                    which they were assigned, and their own reactions. Some of the things that were
                    produced out of this were very useful indeed.</p>
                <p>The fact that the Institute and its language programs were helping in proficiency
                    testing, sending teams out to some of the universities, and inviting academics
                    to come in for workshops at the Institute, was useful and helpful. This I
                    understand has continued and has expanded. So I think this was something that
                    was well established.</p>
                <p>Talking about some of the problems, the budget. I think I mentioned that Harold
                    Hoskins during his tenure [in the 1950s] fought hard for [budgetary resources].
                    And it was during his tenure that the budget at the Institute began to creep up,
                    and we got a fairer share of the State Department's budget. He was less
                    successful in getting appropriate facilities for us. [Around the start of the
                    Kennedy administration, FSI] moved from [the] old C Street entrance to the
                    converted garage at Arlington Towers [in Virginia], which was really a dismal
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Q: I was talking to somebody just yesterday who was talking about we were in a
                    garage, and there were cars parked below us and there would be times when the
                    carbon monoxide would get into the air in the ventilation system.</p>
                <p>SOLLENBERGER: But [getting better facilities] was [something he was] not able to
                    do. I had hopes when I became director [of FSI in the mid-1960s] that I would be
                    able to get better facilities. At one point it looked pretty promising that we
                    could get the Navy quarters [located] across 23rd street from the Department of
                    State. There were some buildings there that would be useful, and things went
                    ahead and there were plans that were drawn up and it seemed as though there was
                    general agreement and approval, until some of the Naval admirals who lived at
                    their residences in that area went to President Kennedy, who was also a Naval
                    officer, and the word came down, forget it. We lost.</p>
                <p>We had another plan and that was to [move] to where the Institute is now located
                    in Arlington, [Virginia]. There was a possibility that that would become vacant
                    and available. But that was vetoed. But we did manage to move into a place in
                    Rosslyn, a high-rise building [at 1400 Key Blvd.]. It was under construction and
                    they were willing to make some adjustments in the way in which it was designed
                    on the interior to accommodate training requirements. That was an improvement,
                    not only there but I think I had one of the nicest offices in Washington on the
                    12th floor overlooking Georgetown and the river. But [I remained] unsuccessful
                    until [Arlington Hall, where we are recording now], and I must give credit to
                    those who were able to engineer this. It was not an easy task, I know.</p>
                <p>The other problem is the pressure [on personnel billets]. Hoskins again made a
                    significant contribution in fighting for training positions so that Foreign
                    Service officers, that were assigned to the Foreign Service Institute for
                    periods of training [exceeding] a certain number of weeks, would come on the
                    rolls of the Institute and all their expenses would be budgeted for by the
                    Foreign Service Institute. [These would be recognized FSI billets.] This
                    increased the budget of the Institute considerably. But it was one way in which
                    we could deal with the problems that the Department was facing where they were
                    reluctant to release people for long-term training, hard languages, any of the
                    other long-term training programs. They felt that they were being pressed for
                    manpower. That was a very creative way of dealing with that particular
                    problem.</p>

                <p>There repeatedly would come up, not annually but at least every couple of years,
                    where Personnel said, these ought to be lumped under allotment to Personnel. Or
                    the bureaus would want the positions back. Or that they ought to be centralized
                    in some other way where it would be more flexible. From the Institute's point of
                    view we didn't want flexibility. We wanted control over the students that were
                    assigned to us. They would not be pulled out midstream, and this was one way of
                    doing it. It also forced the Department to plan [for] training needs. How many
                    positions would be needed for Senior Seminar, for different hard language
                    programs, for diplomats-in-residence, for the whole range of long-term training.
                    It forced a planning process that I think was useful to the Department. That was
                    a contribution that was started by Harold Hoskins that I think was very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>Q: There may be something which will occur to you that I didn't ask and when you
                    get a transcript you can develop something, or if you see something that we
                    didn't cover we can have another interview.</p>
                <p>Thank you very much.</p>
