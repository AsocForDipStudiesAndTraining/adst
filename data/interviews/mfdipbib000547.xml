                <p>Q: Stan, let's start with some background. Where were you born?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was born in Brooklyn, New York, so my accent is come bhonestly, when I
                    talk about the “boyds choyping.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in 1942?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a good year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, excellent year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What month?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: December.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no wonder your eyes sparkled when I said my birthday
                        was iDecember, '42.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My mom always told me it was one year after Pearl Harbor.
                        IFSHIN: [laughter] Yes, well, that might be a connection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was born and raised...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was born in Brooklyn and spent the first 13 years of my life there and
                    then my parents moved to Freeport, Long Island, where I went to high school.
                    From Freeport I went on to Johns Hopkins University and I was going to be a
                    doctor in those days. And I ran into...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were taking science medic undergrad...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's right. My degree is in biology, in fact. And my sophomore year I
                    ran into a course called “Organic Chemistry” which I've always maintained is
                    what drove me out of the idea of pursuing medicine or even science, although I
                    continued taking a science-oriented undergraduate program. I was graduating with
                    no idea of what I wanted to do. I took the graduate records in history and my
                    parents were anxious that I go on and do graduate work in history, but I didn't
                    really want to do that. I wasn't sure what I would do with a degree in
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there interest in history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think it was just the idea that when I told them of my interest in
                    going into the Peace Corps that this was an alternative to the Peace Corps,
                    which they weren't very enthusiastic about. But I did join the Peace Corps, and
                    I went out and trained in Hilo, Hawaii.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: This was summer of 1964, right out of college. It was what they called a
                    “higher education project” _ we were all training to go to the Philippines as
                    high school and college teachers. So I ended up teaching science, largely in a
                    high school, Baguio City High School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's on Luzon</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's Luzon, that's right, in the mountains, it's a lovely city. When I
                    was living there, it was a city of about 50,000 people, which the Americans had
                    built largely as a summer vacation spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hill Station.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Hill Station, exactly. Six months of the year it has an absolutely
                    marvelous climate, a little boring, day after perfect day of temperatures in the
                    70s, cloudless, just beautiful. And the other six months of the year it rains,
                    and it rains hard. It's chilly, actually the temperature never gets below 50�,
                    but it's a very chilling 50�. You get a little stir crazy. But Peace Corps was
                    great for me. I learned a lot, about myself, about other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's back up a second. The training in Hawaii, what did
                        thaconstitute if you knew you were going into education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were being taught methods of teaching, for science, English, and math,
                    because we were training in all three of those areas and we were also given some
                    language training. I was trained in Ilocano, which is the language spoken around
                    northern Luzan. Baguio is part of the Ilocano-speaking area, but in those days
                    at least it was considered a center of English-speaking, because you had a mix
                    of people speaking different Philippine languages and English was so often the
                    lingua franca, but I was trained in Ilocano at that time. And that was an
                    interesting discovery for me because I'd come through high school and college
                    where I'd studied Spanish and German, respectively, convinced that I couldn't
                    learn a foreign language, that I had no talent in foreign languages. And in the
                    Peace Corps is where I discovered that I not only was capable of learning a
                    foreign language but even had a little flair for it. I'm not one of these great
                    language students, but when it's taught in the proper way and you actually have
                    the incentive of the knowledge that you are going to use it, I found I could
                    learn a foreign language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a language area that is not using Spanish? Is
                        Spanislong lost in the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Very little Spanish is really spoken in the Philippines. There are people
                    of Spanish descent who still use Spanish in the home, but that's a very small
                    group. Despite the Spanish names, there are very few Spanish speakers in the
                    Philippines. English is much more widespread and is one of the national
                    languages. I'm not sure if Spanish is a national language, I don't think it
                    is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're teaching science...at what level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It varied. I started teaching I guess the first year of high school; it
                    was a general science course. They did not teach chemistry in high schools in
                    the Philippines. I thought this was an inadequacy and I developed a curriculum
                    and got permission to put together a class of chemistry students. These were
                    largely seniors as I recall. Also, during the summer I taught at a teacher's
                    college. So it ranged from high school through early... actually the summer
                    program was largely teachers who were coming back for retraining, rather than
                    full-time students.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Q: Now this is still the early days of the Peace Corps. How big a program in the
                    Philippines was it by then?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The Philippines had one of the largest programs. When I got there we were
                    group 4. There had already been three groups before us and I think they were all
                    still there when we arrived. During the time I was there I think it got up to 17
                    or 18. That is, they numbered them. Not all in the country at the same time,
                    because by that time some of the earlier programs had left. But my program was
                    still there and we were up to 18. I can't really tell you how large it was, but
                    I think we probably were close to 1,000 volunteers in the Philippines at that
                    point. It was a very large program, probably the largest in the world at that
                    time, I think.</p>
                <p>Q: When I was in Thailand in the '80s the Peace Corps had a reunion and the
                    embassy sponsored a little ceremony. It turned out that there were thousands
                    that appeared, of people who had been in the Peace Corps in Thailand, many of
                    whom hadn't left.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, Thailand seems to have had that effect on people. I knew some Thai
                    volunteers, in fact there were some in my A100 class in the foreign service, and
                    there was something infectious about Thailand. I'm not sure it was always good
                    [laughter] but they certainly were devoted to Thailand.</p>
                <p>Q: You start out then in science education at the high school level, and then
                    summer with the teacher training. Was that then the full two years that you were
                    there?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I got into a few other areas. We did some curriculum design. One of
                    the big projects in my last year was designing and soliciting equipment for the
                    science laboratory for the high school. It was a very fulfilling two years.
                    There were enormous frustrations involved in being a Peace Corps volunteer. But
                    I think for those of us who liked it, it was a great experience, and I did.</p>
                <p>Q: Who were you working under? Were you assigned to that school and that
                    principal as your director? What was the relationship to the educational
                    institutions you were working with?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: In theory, we were co-teachers. We were supposed to be assigned to a
                    teacher and we worked with that teacher. The general science course that I
                    taught, that was the way we started out. I would teach and she would teach and
                    we'd trade off. I was supposed to be introducing her to modern methods of
                    teaching science. Education in the Philippines, as in so many countries, tends
                    to be fairly rote learning, whereas we were supposed to introduce things to make
                    the students question. It wasn't terribly effective, by the way. But that was
                    the theory of what we were trying to do: introduce some of the idea of
                    scientific method and experimentation, questioning, and hypotheses and testing
                    them. Subsequently, when I taught chemistry, I had a teacher I had working with
                    me who I was training to succeed me as the chemistry teacher for that school.
                    There was a principal, of course, and a vice-principal. I don't remember anybody
                    really interfering terribly with my activities. There were four of us who were
                    assigned to Baguio City High School. So I wasn't particularly isolated. There
                    were other students in elementary schools in the area as well, in Baguio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a fair Peace Corps presence in Baguio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I'd say there were 10, 12 Peace Corps volunteers in thcity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your living arrangements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I lived with another volunteer. We rented the top floor of a private
                    home. The Philippines government was paying for our living, and we were being
                    given a subsistence allowance by the Peace Corps as well as having money
                    deposited for us, I think it was $75 a month, in the U.S. Our living allowances,
                    this is interesting for those of us who are old enough to remember it, was $50 a
                    month and we lived very well. During the time I was a Peace Corps volunteer, the
                    first 14 months or so and I didn't get money from any other source, this was
                    money I saved out of my living allowance, I got enough money to take a trip to
                    Hong Kong, Taipei, and Japan. I stayed at reasonable hotels, eat at reasonable
                    restaurants...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Those were the days when the yen was 360 to the dollar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that wouldn't break until way...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, Japan was expensive compared to the rest of those places, but not
                    unaffordable. We'd gotten this special fare, of course, and Peace Corps
                    volunteers are very good at, what's the nice word I'm looking for, soliciting
                    people to give us the combinations and otherwise help us out. But as I said, I
                    stayed at hotels and paid for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were trading on the good name of the Peace
                        Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which means at that time people responded very favorably
                        to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, definitely, definitely. The Peace Corps was still very well-regarded,
                    for those people who were familiar with it, and I guess it still is, but
                    particularly in those days. There was still a lot of idealism associated with
                    it. I always felt a little guilty being in Baguio, I had a very comfortable
                    life. And of course a lot of other volunteers had much more rugged experiences.
                    I had one of the few sit-down, flush toilets in the Peace Corps in the
                    Philippines and volunteers came from hundreds of miles around to use my flush
                    toilet. [laughter] Q: But you were talking earlier about some frustrations that
                    came...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, you are operating in a foreign environment and it's always hard
                    getting things accomplished and getting people on board. The great lesson I
                    learned from Peace Corps is that all sorts of things that I thought of as
                    “that's the way people are” were the way Americans are or were, and that there
                    are many ways of doing things. I am very fond of the Filipino people and think
                    highly of them, generally. But one thing about the Philippines is people do not
                    like to say no. So, whatever you ask, people will say, “yes,” “fine,” “good,”
                    whatever, and then do nothing. So pinning people down and getting them to follow
                    through on what you think is a commitment is not the simplest thing in the
                    world. This was sort of a learned skill on my part, to really trap people into
                    following through on what they said they were going to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I remember in particular when we were designing the laboratory and getting
                    commitment on facilities and things for that, it required a certain amount of
                    effort and it helped. But in general, Americans still had a lot of prestige in
                    the Philippines and we traded on that as well. I remember one occasion when
                    another volunteer and I, over a holiday period, were going towards Manila from
                    Baguio, we were on a bus, and we ran into an enormous traffic jam. The trucks,
                    cars, and busses backed up for miles and it had the aspects of the traditional
                    Chinese fire drill. The four-lane highway, or however many, had developed about
                    12 lanes of traffic all snarling and completely bollixing things up. My
                    companion said, “Come on, Stan, we'll straighten this out.” And we jumped down
                    from the bus and walked to the front of this jam, a couple of miles, where of
                    course there was an accident. We started to line cars up and signal them to come
                    forward one at a time, and this one should get over there and that one, and we
                    were doing our best traffic cop imitation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a scene out of “Patton.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: And we really got it lined up and people were listening to us. And who
                    are we? We are two 21-year old kids, or 22 in those days, who had no authority
                    to do anything, but we knew that people should line up and go one at a time,
                    which was something that not all people there understood at that time. It was
                    fun. There were lots of things we did, and lots of experiences, and I generally
                    look back on those Peace Corps days with great fondness. Of course, it led me
                    into the foreign service. I took the foreign service exam when I was in the
                    Philippines, just more or less on a casual remark by someone, “Hey, Stan, you
                    should take the foreign service exam. Peace Corps will pay for you to go to
                    Manila.” Oh, a free trip, ok. So I went down to Manila to take the exam, and I
                    really knew nothing about the foreign service at that time. I passed the written
                    exam and suddenly it became a very exciting prospect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you did this before your tour was over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me back up to one little thing. Your tour spans 1964
                        t1966. Things are getting interesting in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feelings out of that? From the
                        Filipinoanyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Some of it. In 1966, there wasn't the great opposition to the war that
                    was to develop later. If I can go back to my college days. I'd been on the
                    fringe of certain liberal leftist movements, mostly involved in tutoring people
                    in the ghetto and civil rights demonstrations. In 1963 SDS was founded but
                    didn't reach Johns Hopkins until 1964. The word came down that these various
                    organizations were to merge into SDS (Students for a Democratic Society for
                    those of you who have forgotten). I remember at the time sort of reflecting on
                    this and saying, “I don't have anything in common with these fair play for Cuba
                    creeps and various other sorts of groups, and I don't want to have anything to
                    do with them.” Which I think was a wise decision, then and subsequently.
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>So the ferment, the anti-war thing, was beginning, the 60s so called. But I've
                    always maintained that the critical years were years I was out of the country.
                    Between 1964 and 1966, something very fundamental changed in the United States
                    and to this day I never really caught up or caught on, and am somewhat
                    bewildered by the whole thing. When I came back from the Peace Corps, I remember
                    getting together with friends, and those who had gone on to graduate school had
                    really been radicalized. Those who had gone to work or done their military
                    service, or any one of many other things, were much more as I remembered them
                    being. So there was a definite cleavage, a split, and it seems to me that those
                    are crucial years. As I say, I was in the Philippines in those years so it was
                    always been a little bit of a puzzlement. I remember watching the Watts riots in
                    Los Angeles, I forget what years they took place, but as I recall they are the
                    years that I was in the Philippines. I know there have been race riots in the
                    United States going back many, many years and some very deadly ones, but I'd
                    never seen anything like this that I could recall in my memory and it really
                    kind of shocked and puzzled me at the time. That's really neither here nor
                    there, but anyway these things were happening and of course as an American
                    abroad you are being asked about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, and here you are in an academic situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, but the students didn't question me. I don't ever remember my
                    students asking me one word about that. But occasionally, some of my co-teachers
                    would and other people with whom I'd become friendly and gotten to know in the
                    Philippines would ask me about what was happening and why this was happening. I
                    would admit to my puzzlement and try to come up with explanations, but I didn't
                    have answers.</p>
                <p>Q: Looking at the educational situation that you were in, how were they organized
                    and funded? Was it a central budget that came in from the province, or something
                    like?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I believe that it was actually funded out of Manila. It would often amaze
                    me that some of the teachers would go for months without being paid. I used to
                    be amazed and appalled, and I would say, “How can a government not pay its
                    teachers? How can this possibly happen that they have to go for months without
                    being paid?” Of course, subsequently, as a career bureaucrat, I learned that
                    “they haven't passed the appropriations bill and it's possible we won't be paid
                    this pay period.” And I always thought this was the third world [management] of
                    America which was taking place. It's a very centrally directed program. Language
                    is interesting, because in the Philippines, at least in those years, the first 2
                    or 3 years of schooling is done in one of the local languages. They are taught
                    in Ilocano or Cebuano or Tagalog, and then in those days they would switch to
                    English. English became the medium of instruction; before then it had been a
                    subject. Baguio was actually an exception to that because it was a mixed area.
                    They would start teaching in English with the first year of school, and as a
                    consequence, most of our students spoke relatively good English. It was strong
                    in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall who was head of the Peace Corps in the
                        Philippineat that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Maurice Bean, during at least part of that time. I don't know if you
                    remember Maurice. He subsequently was in the State Department as a country
                    director. I don't remember what directorate he had, quite frankly. I don't think
                    he was a career officer. But he came into the State Department. He got angry
                    with me at one point. I had written an article for the volunteer magazine in
                    which I proposed that Peace Corps staff should be volunteers and that we didn't
                    need another aid bureaucracy in every country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds kind of radical to me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I know, and he took it kind of personally. Had me flown in to Manila
                    and was chewing me out in his office, and I hastily retreated and explained that
                    I didn't mean this in a personal sense at all, and I wasn't discussing anyone.
                    It was a proposal, and it was just the way I thought it should be and the
                    volunteer spirit of the Peace Corps should be reflected at all levels. And I
                    thought then and I think now that it was not an unreasonable proposal,
                    actually.</p>
                <p>Obviously, there would be problems in carrying it out because the people who head
                    the Peace Corps in countries and in regions do have representational
                    responsibilities and do have to do certain things that require that they have
                    residences which are representational. They need to be able to provide for their
                    families, presumably they are somewhat older than the volunteers, but that's
                    changed too, as many volunteers are older as well. When I entered the Peace
                    Corps, we tended to be fresh out of college. That was the great majority.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: At the time the Peace Corps was set up, there was a conscious attempt to
                    separate it from the embassy. Now when you were there in '64-'66, did anyone
                    come by and say hello? There's not a consular up in that area is there?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, there is not. I don't recall anything like that. In Baguio, in those
                    days, there was a recreational facility, a U.S. recreational facility. I
                    hesitate because I think it's military, but the embassy used it to, and the
                    ambassador had a summer residence called, Camp John Hay. In fact, many Filipinos
                    had access to Camp John Hay, but Peace Corps volunteers did not. This was always
                    a puzzlement to my Filipino friends. But I could go to Camp John Hay where you
                    could get things like a malted or a hamburger. I could go as a guest of a
                    Filipino. [laughter] So I occasionally I would get on to Camp John Hay. It was
                    off limits to Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
                <p>Q: This is interesting, because when I was in Thailand on Christmas and
                    Thanksgiving, we would get a turkey up there, and that would draw a large number
                    of Peace Corps volunteers. [laughter]</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't want to skip ahead, because I assume you like to follow a certain
                    order in asking these questions, but when I was consul in Cebu in the
                    Philippines, I of course wanted to be close to the Peace Corps volunteers, I
                    found a certain amount of suspicion on their part... even though I was an
                    ex-volunteer and I made that clear... there was a certain hanging back. Of
                    course, I didn't press it, if people didn't want anything to do with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the early days you were also told you aren't part of
                        the U.S.government, you are this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyway, while you are in the Philippines someone whispers

                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went down to the embassy and took it in 19...</hi>

                <p>IFSHIN: I would guess it was '65, I don't remember exactly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you passed the written exam, taken at the embassy. But
                        thnext step is the oral exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, but since I was overseas they postponed it in thosdays. You could
                    take the oral exam when you came back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back in '66. Mid, early or late?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, summer of '66 I took the oral exam almost right off the bat, and I
                    passed and was told I would receive an invitation probably for September of '66.
                    Meanwhile my draft board contacted me and asked me to report for a physical and
                    I was classified 1A. Then I was told September classes were already filled up,
                    and that I would be coming for January of '67. I, being 1A and people being
                    gobbled up for Vietnam at that point, decided I couldn't wait around and I said,
                    “Well, in that case, I'll postpone my entrance until the summer of '67 and I'm
                    going to take a job teaching, which I did. I got a job teaching on Long Island
                    about an hour from my home. I was living out there and I'd come home on
                    weekends. My draft board then did draft me. I got a notice that said in view of
                    the fact that you are teaching, your report date has been postponed and you can
                    finish your teaching contract and you can report to, I forget where the
                    induction center was, as soon as your teaching contract is fulfilled.</p>
                <p>I wrote to the State Department and said, please send me a letter stating that
                    I'm entering the foreign service. They wrote back and said we don't do that;
                    until you've entered into the foreign service we won't write the draft boards.
                    So I took that letter saying they won't do that, and went to my local draft
                    board and they said, oh, okay, and they waived my draft. So, in the summer of
                    '67 I then joined the foreign service instead of reporting to the U.S. Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] There is a difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, as you've already noted, I did end up in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me go back to the exam. Given your academic training,

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I did very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any interesting circumstance come out of the oral

                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I did. I scored very high on the written exam, particularly on the
                    general knowledge section. I'm not sure what was involved. If you will recall
                    the oral exam, they call you in and then they send you out and then they call
                    back in and they tell you what you did, pass, fail or whatever. That was what
                    happened with me. I'd prepared for the oral exam, I didn't study. They invite
                    you to smoke and there's no ashtrays in there and there's this and that trick
                    and they play these things and here's the kinds of questions and I had all these
                    things prepared. I don't remember anything like that coming up. I remember they
                    asked me to offer I think three areas of American foreign policy with which I
                    disagreed, but not about Vietnam. Three areas beside Vietnam. As I recall, I
                    spoke about China, Latin American policy, and I can't recall what the third area
                    was at all. It was pretty sophomoric in any case as I recall my criticisms now.
                    They were correct frankly, but pretty sophomoric. They were not well founded. In
                    any case, after the exam, and they had me sit outside for maybe ten minutes and
                    then called me back and said, well, I'd passed but they were disappointed. Which
                    was kind of shattering for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How can you pass but be disappointing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, they said they expected more from me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, given the written grade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Given the written grade, they had expected more of an exciting interview.
                    I've always been puzzled by this, and many years later when I had access to my
                    files, I in fact went to see if there was anything about disappointment and
                    there's nothing like that in my written record. I don't know whether they were
                    saying that just to fake me out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took the oral, was there a line of people or one
                        of number...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I recall, I was there myself and there were three interviewers. I
                    don't recall other people being in the waiting room with me or not. It's
                    possible they were, I just don't remember anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it in the State building itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it was in Washington, DC. It was in a State Department building of
                    some sort, but not in Main State. I don't really know where it was, it might
                    have been over in Rosslyn, but I don't really remember. It was a small
                    conference room type of setting. I did smoke in those days and there was an
                    ashtray. I remember whenever I needed a few seconds to think I would take a long
                    draw on my cigarette. As I said, I discussed China, and I remember in discussing
                    it the kinds of objections or kinds of debating points they made opposite me, at
                    the time I remember being somewhat impressed, thinking, “Oh, yes, I never
                    thought of that.” And afterwards thinking these are really trivial and not
                    fundamental at all. This is nonsense. This is not why the U.S. pursues
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you come into the foreign service in June, 1967.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, as I recall that was the month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So now you moved down to Washington, get yourself an
                        apartment,get yourself squared away, and you show up for the A100
                        course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like? Who else was in there with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We had a big class. It was the 64th class and as I recalthere were 80 or
                    more than 80 in the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is large.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, but it included USIS officers. Quite a few of us were ex-Peace Corps
                    volunteers, maybe 10 or 15 out of the 80. There were a number who had the Peace
                    Corps experience. The people who became my closest friends out of that class,
                    the person I roomed with initially was John Craig, I don't know if you know
                    John, he's still in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: He's ambassador to Oman. The people I became closest to, Mike Carpenter
                    and Tim Hamilton, who both ended up in Thailand, Mike was an ex-Peace Corps
                    volunteer as you may recall in Thailand. But we became very good friends and
                    remained friends throughout our foreign service careers. I don't know if you
                    know Tim passed away about two years ago. A real shocker... he's a little
                    younger than I am.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyone else in that class...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There are a number of people in that class, many of whom went on to have
                    important careers and become ambassadors, but I can't really think of that right
                    now.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, You are coming in in June of '67. Vietnam is beginning to dominate
                    things. Was there an aura, a sense, a zeitgeist of the class...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, it was clear to us that all of us who had not done military service
                    who were single, single males who had not done military service would be going
                    to Vietnam, and in fact 11 of us were assigned to Vietnam, including myself,
                    Mike and Tim. Ten of us were assigned to the CORDS program (Civil Operations
                    Revolutionary Development Support) and one was assigned to the embassy, Tim
                    Carney, as I recall. There were a couple of guys who fit the categories, that is
                    they had not done military service and were single, who were not assigned to
                    Vietnam and I have always been curious about that. At least one of them said
                    that he made no bones about it, he'd told them that if he was assigned to
                    Vietnam, he was going to resign. And having been lectured about what a
                    disciplined service we are and how we all saluted and took our assignments and
                    went off and did what was necessary, I always thought that was very interesting
                    that he was not asked to resign or encouraged to resign. He was assigned to
                    somewhere else. He made the senior foreign service and had a long respectable
                    career. I went off to Vietnam and was assigned to, well, that was via a year of
                    area and language studies.</p>
                <p>Q: Getting back to the A100 for a moment, how did you feel... that was foreign
                    service basic training. Did you feel it was foreign service basic training, were
                    there things coming at you that they were presenting to you that was
                    particularly interesting about the foreign service or foreign policy issues?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I knew so little in those days that I should have learned a lot, but I
                    don't remember learning a lot. I don't know what to say about the course... It
                    just strikes me now that it wasn't terribly well done. That might be a
                    misjudgment on my part. I remember lots of being bored and sitting there and
                    trying to take notes in a kind of academic way. My only relevant experience was
                    college and I would sit and write and take down what people were saying.
                    Occasionally there parts better than others. There was a linguist who used to do
                    a very amusing kind of lecture.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Q: Are you thinking of Campbell?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't remember the name. But that's one of the highlights. I
                    encountered him three times subsequently in the next year as I moved through
                    various training programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this was all in the Rosslyn Complex, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, FSI (Foreign Service Institute), in Rosslyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you get through the basic introduction to FSI. Now you
                        gethis assignment to Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And before you go to Vietnam, it's language training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Let me just comment. I was assigned to Vietnam, and I remember
                    calling my parents and telling my mother, “well, mom, I've been assigned to
                    Vietnam, but don't worry about it, because I've got a year of language training,
                    and inevitably things are going to get better, or they will get so much worse
                    that they won't send us.” Well, I was wrong on both counts. [laughter] Yes, I
                    was assigned to language training at the Vietnam training center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that was in the garage, down the hill...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was in the basement of what was called Arlington Towers. It think it
                    has a different name, although it's the apartment complex that's still
                    there...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was literally a garage or something, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, it was the lower, it was basement. I don't know that it was
                    actually the garage. Four of us in fact rented an apartment in Arlington Towers
                    at that time. We had a really nice setup there overlooking the monuments, a
                    twelfth floor apartment, furnished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's right on the banks of the Potomac, on the Virginia
                        side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. It was quite nice. But subsequently there was some bizarreness
                    associated with that apartment because I recall in the 1967 riots after the
                    assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King sort of looking over the monuments and
                    seeing the smoke in the background. It was all kind of surreal, and kind of
                    what's going on and where is the country headed and what is all this? But we
                    were busy learning Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, four guys were sharing an apartment who were into
                        Vietnamesand were going off to Vietnam. Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Tim and Mike and myself, and Joe Romanelli who was not in the A100 course
                    but was a young foreign service officer who I guess we met at the Vietnam
                    training center. I guess he was on his third tour. He subsequently left the
                    foreign service somewhere down the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were all four of you in the same language class? Was it
                        verlarge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, we were in the same group. That is people started together and then
                    we were broken up according to abilities I guess, or in any case broken up into
                    smaller groups. Mike Carpenter by the way has a 78 MLAT (Modern Language
                    Aptitude Test) and is one of the real- (end of tape)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just starting to tell me about language
                        training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, the program went on for ten months. Every once in a while somebody
                    would peel off. They were not making sufficient progress in the language, so
                    they would send them off to Vietnam without the language.</p>
                <p>

                <p>IFSHIN: So it was incumbent upon you to keep up the work of thlanguage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's got to be a fairly large program by now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: I've gone through Chinese and there were four teachers. In the Vietnamese
                    program there must have been a fair... where did they get all the teachers?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were just a large number of Vietnamese in the U.S. then. I don't
                    know where they recruited them from or how they found them. There were a number
                    of attractive young ladies for the most part, and they would make us sit there
                    like good little boys and do our drills and repeat everything back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the issue of local cuisine? There weren't
                        anVietnamese restaurants in Washington, DC, at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't remember. Subsequently when I studied Chinese, that was always a
                    big thing to go out to the Chinese restaurants together and try the various
                    kinds of Chinese cuisine. I don't remember that being an issue in Vietnamese
                    language training. We were more concerned about learning how to say give me that
                    rocket launcher, or I'm a French journalist. There was certain vocabulary we
                    concentrated on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in language training there though, Tet
                        appears othe scene, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, and that was a big shocker. I can't remember if it was Henry Cabot
                    Lodge who met with us. He was of course the U.S. ambassador at the time. He came
                    and spoke to us at the training center, and a number of other people came and
                    spoke to us. Let me mention one thing, this is sort of retreating. In CORDS, we
                    were on loan from the State Department to AID (Agency for International
                    Development), who then in turn loaned us to the military. And when all the other
                    members of my A100 class went off for consular training, those of us who were
                    going through the CORDS program went off to some sort of an AID training
                    program, which was truly one of the most colossal wastes of time I've ever been
                    through, and I've been through a lot of wastes of time, but this was one of the
                    prize ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they cover, how to fill out forms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't remember now, it's been a long time. But we were really silly.
                    Those of us who were State Department officers assigned to the program made
                    ourselves really obnoxious. I can see why people don't like foreign service
                    officers.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, at this point, what did you understand about CORDS, because CORDS in
                    fact has already undergone a number of changes. It didn't become CORDS until '67
                    I believe. It wasn't an AID program until Comer made it CORDS in '67.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Well, it was something that was undergoing change. Dick Holbrook
                    had actually met with our A100 class, it wasn't our Vietnam training center. He
                    was one of the young officers who had gone through a precursor type program
                    where he had something to do in the provinces. He explained it to us how career
                    enhancing it would all be for us and what a great opportunity it was and how
                    exciting it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He quit two years later. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think we all recognized at the time that this is a bunch of bs,
                    but we listened politely. We were young, and young people tended to be more
                    polite to their elders in those days. In any case, returning to the Vietnam
                    training center, we got area studies and lectures about the overall strategies
                    and what was involved in the war, but basically it was language studies more
                    than anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, the Vietnam training center was a separate part
                        of FSwasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that? Just because it was so large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: So large. Yes, they were running through enormous numberof people at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't know, I can't tell you. But in addition to those who were there
                    for the full language program, which was supposed to be 10 months to a year,
                    there were lots of short-termers, people who were there for six weeks, eight
                    weeks, and various shorter programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of language and area studies. Were there anything else
                        therdoing language and area studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were all sorts of voluntary programs that they tried to set up. I
                    remember I participated in a small arms program, and we'd go down to the
                    national police training center and shoot pistols and try to improve our
                    marksmanship. And then they were training people in self-defense. I didn't sign
                    up for that one. It's interesting, they recruited somebody to teach them and
                    this guy would come in and whack them in the knees with a broom handle and show
                    them all sorts of painful holds where he'd grab them and do weird things to
                    them. It turned out he had absolutely no credentials whatsoever. This was just
                    some sort of sadist the State Department had hired [laughter]. I shouldn't say
                    State Department; who the Vietnam training center had hired to take out his
                    sadistic tendencies on these young trainees, as if they weren't miserable enough
                    already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was head of BTC at that time, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No I do not. I can't remember the name. He had had some troubled
                    experiences in Vietnam and had apparently a drinking problem, quite a bad one,
                    and was being allowed to serve out his time preparing for retirement at VTC. I
                    may be confusing whoever was the head of the program with someone who was in a
                    senior position in VTC at that time. Well, as part of a Christmas show, a group
                    of us in the usual way, putting a series of skits where we mocked various people
                    including this guy, and I recall an audible gasp going up from certain segments
                    of the audience when we hung a map and shook it and with pretense of delirium
                    tremors, which was something that had happened, and we were using that incident
                    for our amusement. But Tim and Mike and I formed what we called the Vocal CORDS
                    where we wrote a series of song parodies and we would perform these at the drop
                    of a chord. Some of them were semi-amusing and in any case, we liked them at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>Q: Actually, the idea of the Vocal CORDS expanded later. Because when I was in
                    Bangkok, some of the guys would come over... Gormley and John Lisle and do that
                    kind of routine at our little parties.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Jim Gormley was in the Vietnam training center with us. This was like his
                    second or third tour in the foreign service. He'd been in a while. We had a
                    couple of more senior people who were preparing to go out as province senior
                    advisors. I guess they were what is now an 02, but in those days was an 03 or
                    04. Seemed very senior to us as young officers.</p>
                <p>Q: Those CORDS songs by the way are at Cornell University. There's an
                    anthropologist up there who collected them, I don't know what her source was,
                    but Cornell has one of the premier collections on Vietnam...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, well, I'm here to tell you that Mike Carpenter and wrote 90 percent
                    of it. We'd always recruit Tim to help us out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, [laughter] you might have a copyright problem with
                        it...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, [laughter] no copyright problem.</p>
                <p>Q: But it's an interesting thing we can get back to later, because I was a
                    supervisor in China at the time of Tiananmen Square. We went through that whole
                    thing and evacuated the families. One of the things that occurred sort of
                    spontaneously with my younger officers, they started doing that same thing,
                    taking contemporary songs and putting new lyrics in them.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: But actually the songs were not contemporary that we used, we used old
                    mostly old standards. This shows something about our age or something about our
                    culture [laughter] but Mike and I were very into the old standards and knew a
                    lot of them and those are the songs we used for the Vocal CHORDS songbook, which
                    I still have somewhere hidden away also, a complete set. Basically it was
                    written in three periods and each was written for a specific performance that we
                    were going to have for CORDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the ten month language training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: And we might have done one I think once we got there. We had some sort of
                    reunion. But we obviously couldn't collaborate very well because we weren't
                    assigned together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Tet comes along, and everybody says, whoosh what was
                        that ithat where we are going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, well, there were a whole bunch of things that were happening that
                    were very upsetting and disturbing and that was one of them. Then there was the
                    May Offensive somewhat after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. And of course you are sitting there in
                        languagtraining watching all these trains come down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: People in the embassy, you know, there's the Vietcong in thU.S.
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hmm. That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: But we would write another song. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So finally they gave you a ticket.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, we arrived more or less as a group, a large group of us arrived
                    together and were all assigned to the same bachelor officer's quarters hotel. I
                    remember that night...</p>
                <p>Q: That was August...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: August of '68. We'd just arrived in Vietnam. First of all we are getting
                    our debriefing and a bomb goes off. A motorcyclist with a bomb, just outside one
                    of the office buildings where we were being briefed. We heard it go off and we
                    thought, ok. Then we went out to this hotel and we were having a few beers, we
                    were on the roof of this hotel as I recall and the lights were flickering across
                    the street. A couple of the guys said, “Do you think those are signals? It looks
                    like signals to me. I think somebody's signaling something there. Anyway,
                    somebody called, I don't know who, some sort of security authority saying he
                    thinks he sees somebody signaling. And they asked how long he'd been in the
                    country, and he said he'd been there a little less than 24 hours, and they said,
                    okay, thank you. [laughter].</p>
                <p>And then we got our assignments. We were told what parts of Vietnawe were going
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't get that information until you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Until we arrived in the country, yes. I was assigned to Three Corps,
                    which was subsequently to become third military region, which is the area
                    basically around Saigon. I was assigned to Thu Thua district in Long An
                    Province. First they sent me to Bien Hoa, which is the corps headquarters and
                    John Paul Vann was the head of CORDS in Three Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get this straight, Three Corps extends from the
                        ocean tthe Cambodian border. It's a horizontal stripe almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, I think of it more of a blob, frankly. But it's othe ocean, yes,
                    and it goes right up to the Cambodian border.</p>
                <p>Q: How many provinces were...</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't remember. 8, 12, I don't remember. It was the area around Saigon.
                    Long An was about 20 miles south of Saigon. John Paul Vann wanted to interview
                    everybody before they went off to their assignment. He wasn't there when I
                    arrived so I sort of had to sit around Bien Hoa. And he also had a program where
                    he wanted people to go out and observe CORDS activities in three different
                    locations before they went to their assignment. I remember the first place he
                    sent me, I can't remember the name of the province right now, anyway I arrived
                    in a chopper or small plane that set me down at this isolated airport. Nobody is
                    there. The plane takes off and leaves, and I'm standing there with a suitcase in
                    the middle of Vietnam on a runway. When I say runway, this was PSP planking, a
                    rudimentary type runway. There was a building but nobody was around. And then a
                    jeep came scooting up and they said, oh, yes, sorry we're a little late, and
                    they took me off and they said we have a civilian here but he's not here right
                    now. But you can watch what we do. I really didn't think they were doing much of
                    anything, but I watched them for the day or 48 hours or 72 hours or whatever I
                    was supposed to watch them for. I got picked up and flown back to Binwa.</p>
                <p>And then they sent me to the city, a fairly big important place, and I flew in at
                    the airport, mass confusion, no one's there to meet me and I hear there's VC in
                    town. I have a contact number or I get one from some of the American personnel,
                    this was a big airport and there was lots of American personnel around and I got
                    some number to call the CORDS office there. And they said, well, we have VC in
                    town and you better just go back. So I go back to the air traffic people and say
                    can I get back to Binwa. No, there's no flights to Binwa. Are there any flights
                    to anywhere? And there was a flight to some place I'd never heard of, and I
                    asked, well, is that a big place, and they said yes, and I asked am I likely to
                    get a flight to Binwa from there. Yes. So that's what I did in fact and came
                    back to Binwa. I went in and I'd had two of my three trips and I said, “I think
                    I'm prepared, I think I'm ready to get out there and do my thing. I've seen
                    enough of what everyone's doing and how it's going.”</p>
                <p>So I went down to Thu Thua, where I was the lone civilian on a team that
                    consisted of a major, two lieutenants, about 4 or 5 senior sergeants, when I say
                    senior I mean 06s and 07s, and a couple of more junior specialist type,
                    corporals, 03s and 04s. Basically, Thu Thua was not a bad little place with a
                    population of about 50,000. It was about 20 minutes ride from the provincial
                    capital. I got to the work as the lone civilian sort of getting into the
                    civilian areas of the pacification program. And there were a number of things
                    going in the civilian area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there teams assigned to each city? How did that team
                        comto be assigned there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, CORDS assembled the largely military teams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, 80 percent were military.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, and in the district, as I say, I was the onlcivilian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a district in the district town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. In the province there were 6 or 7 districts, and there was a CORDS
                    team in I think 3 or 4 of them, and a CORDS headquarters in the provincial
                    capital with all kinds of advisors advising in this area and that area and doing
                    that and this. Everything was going along reasonably, I think... I want to make
                    a comment about the hamlet evaluation system. You've heard about that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We used to assign these letter grades, a whole string of letter grades,
                    to each hamlet in our district.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an attempt to sort of standardize what everybody
                        was seeing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, and also to measure progress. You could see where iwas last month,
                    and this is where it is this month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are some of the categories of things that are being
                        observed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Were there VC in the town during the day? Were there VC in the town
                    during the night? Were there tax collectors with VC infrastructure, when is the
                    last time they were there? Had we carried out this program A, program B, was
                    this instituted in the town? What's the last time there was a military incident?
                    I can't remember exactly how many hamlets I had in my district... maybe 30? And
                    we carried a couple of so-called VC-controlled. These are places we didn't go,
                    except in force. And then we had a lot that as far as we knew, the VC weren't
                    there and hadn't been there for a while, and we assigned them their ranking on
                    that basis. One of the things that I was very determined about and felt strongly
                    that nobody was every going to catch me exaggerating these things and I was
                    going to call them as I saw them and be just absolutely accurate. This is the
                    point I want to make: after you'd been there three or six months and you're
                    evaluating things and you are working hard, and you say, “well, you know, things
                    must have gotten better after all the hard work I'd put into this, so where this
                    used to be a C, maybe it's become a B, in this particular category, and this one
                    is now this. So there's a certain amount of grade creep in all this.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Q: How much of these evaluations... are you going around to the individual
                    hamlets and chatting up the either the government people or tribal father,
                    although that's not the right term?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I wouldn't say...village chief... I wouldn't say that I got to each
                    hamlet every month. Certainly the ones that we carried that were VC controlled I
                    didn't get to. But I got around. I was assigned an International Harvester
                    Scout, that was the vehicle that CORDS assigned its personnel. And I'd go
                    driving all over the place and get into these various hamlets and talk to
                    people. I spoke Vietnamese fairly well at that point, and about what was
                    happening and how things were. I'm skipping ahead here. There's another point I
                    wanted to make. This was much later in my stay.</p>
                <p>We had what we called what we called our pacification offenses where we'd come in
                    with military forces and then bring in all the Vietnamese government's services,
                    these were the so-called VC-controlled hamlets, and we'd move in in force and be
                    out to make them government hamlets. It was interesting, in many ways this was
                    the first time I had visited these places and I'd talked with people. I think
                    they were being honest with me and I'd say, “When's the last time the VC were
                    here?” And they'd say, “Tet, 1967.” What happened then, they rounded up a bunch
                    of our young men and they marched them off to Saigon and they never came
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Tet '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, you are right. I'm talking about in '69 actually when we were doing
                    these offenses. Basically, it's quite true, after Tet, I don't know if it's
                    conventional wisdom now, but it certainly widely acknowledged that while Tet was
                    an enormous victory for the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese in the United
                    States, a tremendous propaganda and psychological victory, it was in fact an
                    overwhelming military defeat. The Vietcong at least in my part of Vietnam was
                    essentially wiped out in that period. And from there on in, we were fighting
                    North Vietnamese, largely North Vietnamese regulars.</p>

                <p>Things were going rather well in my district, and the decision had in fact been
                    made that I would become the district senior advisor, instead of the Army Major,
                    that is when he was replaced and I would be the senior person on the team with
                    the Army Major as my deputy. And just about this time... I smile, but it's kind
                    of a very sad business... My district stretched all the way up to the Cambodian
                    border, although basically there was no population and this was a free fire zone
                    for a number of miles toward the Cambodian border and the population was all
                    concentrated in the south of the district. And two, well, I don't know if it was
                    two Vietnamese batallions, it's all become foggy, but in any case the North
                    Vietnamese force infiltrated through this free fire zone and attacked a couple
                    of hamlets that we'd always considered quite secure, and with a great deal of
                    destruction. The American Colonel, Asa Grey, who was our province senior
                    advisor, landed in a helicopter near the battle zone and was killed. On
                    reflection, this is all quite sad. In any case, when he was replaced by another
                    Army Colonel who thought this was a really rough district and bad things are
                    happening and of course the whole plan that we could possibly have a civilian as
                    the senior advisor there was thrown out. So I continued as the deputy in Thu
                    Thua and was sort of unhappy about that situation, and was subsequently moved to
                    the province capital as part of the pacification team there and had some
                    province-wide responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of responsibilities, when you are in Thu Thua,
                        what aryou doing on a daily basis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was on the road a lot, visiting various hamlets and trying to discuss
                    the functioning of the civilian side of the Vietnamese government, and were they
                    getting the services they were supposed to get. If they weren't, I would try to
                    follow up to see that they in fact did get some of these services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That means that you hooked in to the Vietnamese
                        government, athat level you are attempting to stimulate them to
                        produce...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Or I'm contacting an American at the next higher level asking him to get
                    his Vietnamese contacts to produce for my Vietnamese contact who claim that they
                    can't do what they're supposed to do because they don't have the inputs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are your Vietnamese contacts suggesting that you are going
                        to have more clout if he needs a sack of concrete or some bricks or
                        whatnot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh yes, sure, right. He's convinced that he's not going to get anywhere
                    if he goes to his next higher level and asks for it but if the Americans tell
                    them to deliver it maybe it will work. You could argue that we weren't really
                    building government there.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Q: That's the next question, because if the decision is up to him to circumvent
                    his own organization then his own organization isn't learning anything. On the
                    other hand, CORDS guys were reporting at all kinds of levels that this one
                    official is simply incompetent or crooked and he's the bottleneck...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, in fact, after I'd been in Thu Thua for a while, we had the
                    Vietnamese district commander who I recall was also a major, was replaced by a
                    Vietnamese lieutenant colonel, who was terribly corrupt. I was aware of the
                    corruption and was doing something about it and trying to get him to stop
                    building some of the private projects he had going on using government materials
                    for that. A fellow named Ev Bumgartner, was a longtime Vietnam hand who was
                    based in Saigon, got in touch with me and said supposedly there was some sort of
                    a contract out on me. [laughter] That I was interfering and they were going to
                    get rid of me. I thought it was all a bunch of nonsense really, and Ev did, too,
                    but he wanted to let me know, rather than...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just in case things looked suspicious from time to time.
                        Are yoarmed or with an armed escort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Normally, I went out on my own. I had, by this time, acquired quite a bit
                    of weaponry. I bought a Walther PPK. I don't know if you are a handgun
                    enthusiast, I am not. But that was James Bond's weapon, after he got rid of his
                    Beretta. So I figured if it was good enough for James Bond it was good enough
                    for me and that was my personal weapon. But in fact, I also acquired an M16 and
                    a shotgun and various other weapons of one kind or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you practice with any of these things? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I never fired in anger, and seldom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you fire in practice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I might have shot my Walther PPK a couple of times just to see how it
                    operated and what I had to do to shoot it. I guess I fired an M16 and some of
                    the other weapons, but I don't recall practicing with them. We came under mortar
                    fire occasionally in the district headquarters. You know, they can stand off 20
                    miles away and lob mortars, so that would happen. Once, walking across the
                    fields with another American, he claimed that a bullet had whistled between us.
                    I did not in fact notice that, but I don't ever remember coming under individual
                    hostile fire of that kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Q: Some of the other people in CORDS remark on the resources they had to
                    distribute. Was that something you were in, could you control concrete or had
                    funds or had administrative resources or were you prodding and poking rather
                    than providing?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think I was prodding, poking rather than providing. We would get some
                    resources and we could access things, but I wasn't in the direct chain of
                    providing. It was more or less trying to get someone else to provide.</p>
                <p>Q: So basically you are performing a reporting role. When I was next door in
                    Thailand about the same time, that's what Tom Barnes had us do. We went to every
                    district and most of the villages and talked to the police chiefs and the
                    village chiefs and what's going on.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were doing that, but I'd go back to the province and say we need such
                    and such for this hamlet. They've got a project, they want to build a footpath
                    and they need so many bags of cement and some rebar. Can you get that for me?
                    And eventually, usually, we'd manage to get it for them. I remember that there
                    was a Navy Seabee detachment in the province for quite some time, and they'd put
                    in a walking bridge, a hanging bridge across a large canal we had that was quite
                    impressive, really, and there had never been a bridge across that canal before.
                    And then they also put in a road for me toward one of the hamlets that we
                    carried as VC controlled. That might not have been the greatest project in the
                    world because shortly after that there was a command detonated mine on that road
                    that sort of let us know it wasn't really safe to use. Putting in a road wasn't
                    going to be sufficient to make this a marvelous safe hamlet. But I was convinced
                    that if we just tie them into the market, we could do this, we could pacify
                    them, win their hearts and minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went from the village level back up to the
                        province, othe district, you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was at the district.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started out at the district.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, usually I was trying to tie the hamlet to the province through the
                    district, trying to get each to perform their functions and get them to do what
                    they were supposed to do.</p>
                <p>Q: From time to time, were CORDS people brought up from the district to the
                    provincial center and discuss their problems... sort of a staff meeting?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. I'm trying to remember how many civilians we had at the district
                    level. I can only remember myself and John Zerolis. I don't know if you know
                    John.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He just retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: He was in the neighboring district right next door. Then a fellow named
                    Bruce Kinsey was at the province level. I think he had been in a district before
                    that. Bruce had been in a district and then went into the provinces. I forget
                    what title he was given, but it was an important title at the province level. I
                    used to work closely with Bruce as we got along well together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not the right time, but it occurs to me... what
                        were yotold as to why there were foreign service officers in CORDS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Because LBJ (Lyndon B. Johnson) had said that he wanted the foreign
                    service to participate and I think that was the only reason. Now, subsequently
                    we were told that this was going to be a great experience for us and we were
                    learning all about rural southeast Asia and we were seeing a really unique side
                    of things that would stand us in good stead throughout our careers. And all that
                    was of course crap. But the bottom line was that LBJ wanted the foreign service
                    there and rather than deliver officers who had by dint of hard work acquired a
                    lot of experience and they said, well, let's send some young guys out there and
                    hope they survive.</p>
                <p>Q: My research suggests that about 10% of the foreign service was in CORDS at any
                    one time or that 10% of the slots were for foreign service, 80% were military
                    and then other agencies. But there's a book, I can't think of the author right
                    now, it's called Pacification and he suggests that with Tet and literally the
                    demise of the Vietcong, CORDS then put on a big push to really move the program
                    and move pacification in the absence of the Vietcong which had expended itself
                    in Tet. That was basically the period you were there. Was there a sense that
                    now's the time to make some hay?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, as I say, when we started our pacification offensives, which was
                    after I'd been there for some time, but when we started that, we went into open
                    areas and found that they were quite ready for our efforts. There were no
                    Vietcong around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're coming out of Vietnam early 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. I left Vietnam with no orders, well, I had orders - you can't leave
                    without orders, but I remember I hadn't gotten my orders for some time and my
                    due date was coming up and I'd go up to Saigon and say, “Hey, I'm due to leave
                    in February and I hadn't gotten orders yet.” I suppose this was January.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Personnel in the embassy. I'm in the foreign service, so... And they
                    said, not to worry this happens all the time... I remember when I was in Germany
                    I didn't get my orders for three week after I was due to leave. I said, wait a
                    second, that was Germany, this is Vietnam... I want my orders and I want to get
                    out of here the day I'm supposed to get out of here. If I don't have any orders,
                    I'm leaving anyway. You can find me in Bangkok. And she said, well, you can't do
                    that, you can't leave without orders. I said, well, you better get me my orders
                    then [laughter].</p>
                <p>Let me go back for a minute and mention another part of my experiences. It was a
                    brief window when Cambodia opened up, that is before the fighting expanded, when
                    we established...</p>
                <p>Sihanouk was still in power. I went into Cambodia that year with a group of
                    people, I can't remember who we all were, but we went to Angkor Wat. That's one
                    of the most exciting things I've ever seen and I wanted to mention that.</p>
                <p>Q: As a tourist you mean...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. Okay, back to leaving Vietnam. In any case, I did get orders and
                    they didn't have any onward assignment, but I did get orders that allowed me to
                    leave the country. I went to Taipei, where I got a call that I was supposed to
                    report to Washington on such and such a date to begin French language
                    training... I going to Niamey. I said that's fine. I got home to my parents
                    where I was on home leave. And I got another call that said scratch that, I can
                    stay on home leave a little longer because you're going to start Spanish
                    language training. You are going to Fernando Po, Equatorial Guinea. I'd never
                    heard of Fernando Po, or Equatorial Guinea and I went to the library and looked
                    it up. I said there is absolutely no way that after Vietnam that I am going to
                    Fernando Po. And I arrived in Washington and that assignment had been scratched
                    as well and I didn't have an onward assignment. They put me on the West Africa
                    desk to sort of pass time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are we looking at? Is this just the system
                        churning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, they just didn't have anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you're kind of off cycle and the standard cycle is
                        thsummer cycle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, but if I had gotten language training it would have put me right
                    back on cycle. But in fact, the guy who went to Fernando Po [laughter], again
                    it's another tragic foreign service story. If you remember, back in the early
                    '70s there was a murder...</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two guys...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, in the vault. One of the officers killed the communicator. There
                    were two people there. Very difficult place, from everything I've heard. I've
                    never been there. But anyway, the murderer, who spent many years subsequently at
                    St. Elizabeth's, was the guy who got my assignment. He snatched that assignment
                    away from me. [laughter]</p>
                <p>Q: And here you sit. So being in Vietnam and being in that particular situation
                    seem to get you any extra brownie points with the personnel system?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Not really, I don't want to complain too much. In fact, when I got back,
                    there was a lot of talk about how they were doing great things for the people
                    who were coming back from CORDS and how the CORDS officers were very
                    enthusiastic... and it wasn't me, believe me...[laughter] but somebody said, oh
                    you ought to talk to Stan Ifshin if you think CORDS officers are enthusiastic. I
                    got to talk to Bill Sullivan who was then the deputy assistant secretary in EAP
                    and kind of doing Vietnam stuff, and tell him all my complaints and all my
                    negatives. I also got to talk to, I think I got to meet with the director
                    general... myself and I think it was Mike Carpenter. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are making this presentation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, were given the chance to vent and to talk to some fairly high level
                    people about our feelings and tell them what we learned on our trip to
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you learn on your trip to Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Nobody has anything terribly original to say about Vietnam, and so many
                    people had been through the experience. I try not to talk about it too much,
                    frankly. It's sort of like picking at one of those scabs you do reflexively, and
                    you hate yourself for doing. We handled it very badly. I remember at the time
                    sort of consoling myself by saying, well, we're learning a lesson here. And we
                    have hundreds of foreign service officers who are learning and will never repeat
                    these mistakes again. About this time. About this time, I think Barbara Tuchman
                    came out with her book, Stillwell and the American Experience in China. She was
                    very deliberately drawing the parallels of course, but it was kind of shocking
                    to see that by golly we already had this experience and we didn't learn. All
                    these experiences of course are unique to some degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying is the pacification effort that you saw
                        was missing its target.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: We really didn't know we were doing, very well. Often, in the case of the
                    foreign service, many of us were young officers, very inexperienced. Of course
                    we were tremendously talented and had all sorts of innate abilities, but we
                    weren't prepared to lead and make a significant contribution. My personal
                    observation is that the U.S. military, again I met some very fine people in
                    CORDS, but the U.S. military did not assign its best people to the CORDS effort.
                    They were in combat units or doing other “more important” things, from the
                    military point of view. This was an effort that there were people who were very
                    interested in, but it wasn't top priority for most of the people who had
                    personnel to assign.</p>
                <p>Q: The military people that you worked with, was this their only exposure to
                    Vietnam or had they'd been in combat units before and now this was their second
                    go-around, how would you characterize it?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It depends. Some of them had been in combat before and some of them had
                    come in with other units and been assigned. I think many of the NCOs were
                    screwups who people were getting out of their units because they were
                    troublemakers of some sort or another. I don't know how they made these
                    assignments, but I don't think they were people who were necessarily the
                    best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you point to as a major failing of the program
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the idea that anybody could be an advisor. All you had to do was
                    call someone “covan,” which is Vietnamese for advisor, and he was an advisor. It
                    takes a certain amount of knowledge of the culture and some sensitivity to the
                    culture, and obviously we can't train millions of people to speak the language,
                    but there are even hundreds of thousands, but you have at least to have people
                    with a certain amount of empathy and a little feeling for the people. Basically,
                    I'm convinced that there was a widespread recognition on the part of the
                    American leadership that Vietnam was a lost cause and we were just spinning our
                    wheels during the time I was there. Don't let it happen on my watch, pass it
                    along to somebody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you are there during the period where John Paul Vann
                        iriding high in third corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. I'm not really talking about John Paul Vann. I don't know John Paul
                    Vann from Adam. We interviewed with him. I had occasion to meet the fellow who
                    succeeded Cumers as the head of CORDS, who went on to become the head of CIA. I
                    briefed him on one occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Helms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Not Helms. William Colby. One of the unique things about my district was
                    General Big Minh was from that district. So there was interest in him because he
                    was a figure in Saigon, so what kind of a following does he have in the
                    district, etc. With regard to that, just to repeat one anecdote... I recall on
                    one occasion, Mike Skol, who was then with the embassy's provincial reporting
                    unit, came down to visit in my district and we went around together. We met with
                    a village chief or hamlet chief, I think it was a village chief who should have
                    been somewhat politically sophisticated. Mike asked him - I was serving as
                    translator - about the five political parties. He started talking about the five
                    political parties, which were the Buddhist party, the Catholic party, the Huahao
                    party, I can't think of the religions... he couldn't think of the fifth religion
                    then and finally came up with Protestant, and there were none in our area then.
                    Politics was totally off the board. It had nothing to do with these people's
                    daily lives and the political parties were totally irrelevant. The political
                    parties were strictly Saigon organizations which had nothing to do with life in
                    rural Vietnam and had no followings in rural Vietnam. I was never a fan of the
                    Vietnam war, but I always thought that once we got into it that we should do our
                    best and try to win it. I do feel that the way we left, and in particular the
                    way we abandoned the South Vietnamese who were our allies, left us with no glory
                    whatsoever. It was a pretty sad episode. But there we are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After personnel is communicating with you off and on over
                        thitime, you finally do end up with an assignment in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, again, there's a little bit more gyrations there. I was briefly on
                    the West Africa desk, sort of filling in and sitting in a seat. I was offered a
                    job in Durban, in South Africa where we have a 3-man consulate. I would have
                    been the third officer. At the time, I said, well, having just learned to love
                    the war in Vietnam, I don't want to learn to love apartheid and I really don't
                    want to go to South Africa. So, I went down to talk to my CDO, this was Linda
                    Feifle. She said if you can come up with something else then you don't have to
                    accept this assignment, but you have to have something else, you can't just turn
                    down an assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is at the time in which what's open is known to
                        very fepeople?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, it's before open assignments. In any case, I'm told there's an
                    opening in the operations center. I went up there and I interviewed and they
                    decided to hire me. I ended up in the operations center where I did 13 or 14
                    months first as an associate watch officer and then as an editor. There were
                    3-men watch teams. You had a senior watch officer, a SWO, an 02 officer - what
                    is now an 02 but in those days an 03 or 04 - and then the associate watch
                    officer, which was a 06 or something.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Q: Now this was the Kennedy administration reform of the foreign service, the
                    establishment of the operations center, which is supposed to be a 24-hour
                    operation, watching the globe around the world, and everything that's reported
                    comes into this and you are to alert people as things come up.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, precisely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these 3-men units are working 24 hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, we each do 8-hour watches, 8 to 4, 4 to 12, and 12 to 8. As I
                    recall, you rotated through that cycle and then you had two days off. I can't
                    recall precisely how it worked. But...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd work your 8 to 4 for a week, and then 4 to 12 for a
                        week,and 12 to 8 for a week and then you'd get a couple of days off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In any case, it was a fun and interesting job in many ways. A number of
                    things happened on my watch, so to speak. I remember when the political
                    counselor in Amman disappeared into a Palestinian refugee camp. We have had a
                    number of those incidents subsequently, but in those days it was pretty rare. It
                    happened, and we got a flash message from Amman telling us what had happened.
                    This was 12 or 1 o'clock and I called Al Atherton who was then the deputy
                    assistant secretary at NEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning that you are talking
                        about,not the afternoon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. He listened to me and subsequently called back. I remember waking
                    him up several times in the course of the night, in which he was always
                    invariably polite and nice. Then he dictated a response to me and the embassy
                    was instructed to go in at the highest levels in Jordan and make sure everything
                    possible was being done to recover our political counselor safely. I turned to
                    the senior watch officer after taking this message and dispatching it, and said,
                    isn't the embassy doing that? And he said, well, of course they are, but
                    tomorrow morning Joe Sisco is going to come in and Al is going to brief him
                    about what's happened, and Sisco's going to say, what did you do? And Al is
                    going to say, well, I sent a message telling them to take this up at the highest
                    levels, etc. So it was a useful lesson to me about what a lot of our work is and
                    why we do it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, actually, from that perch if you will, you are watching the entire
                    world. The middle East is coming in, things are coming in from Asia. You were
                    seeing a very broad view of the foreign service, different from the rice paddies
                    in Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, right, quite different from the rice paddies in Vietnam. Yes.
                    Another incident that happened on my watch... I was on duty when we got a
                    message from the Coast Guard which was very difficult to understand. I couldn't
                    figure it out terribly well what they were trying to say. I showed it to the
                    senior watch officer, who was Gifford Malone, who was an Eastern European type,
                    and he told me to call the Soviet desk. This subsequently turned out to be about
                    the defecting seaman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seaman. Mississippi or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, he jumped onto an American Coast Guard vessel, and the Coast Guard
                    commander returned him to the Soviets. This sort of gets worse and worse, as you
                    recall, because it turned out that he had in fact some sort of a claim to
                    American citizenship, but that's neither here nor there. In any case, it
                    subsequently became an enormous scandal and the operations center was very much
                    in the middle of it, and a number of personnel in the operations center were
                    debriefed and testified before Congress about what had happened and what they
                    had done. I never had to testify and nothing I had done was questioned because I
                    had done exactly what I was supposed to do. But I did not understand that
                    particular cable and I subsequently asked Malone about it, why did you tell me
                    to call the Soviet desk? I didn't understand what was happening in that message,
                    and he said, well, neither did I but there was a smell about it. [laughter] That
                    was another useful lesson: be alert to smells.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's the whole issue of practice and
                        professionalism, you just have a feeling...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, the finger spiel.</p>
                <p>Q: That something's coming down the line. So from this office, you are calling
                    people at night, you're calling the desks during the day, you are making sure
                    everybody is linked up.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The last half of that assignment, I was an editor. The job of the editor
                    was to take his selection of the most important cables that had come in during a
                    12-hour period, both before he came on duty and during the time he was on duty,
                    and do a summary of those cables for the secretary. This was not an unimportant
                    thing because it was your opportunity to draw cables to the secretary's
                    attention. And I don't want to talk invidiously about anyone, but particularly
                    at this time when William Rogers was Secretary of State, I think he did not read
                    a whole lot, so having this opportunity to draw cables to his attention was very
                    important.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>My great triumph on this job, that is when I was editor, is that I was on duty
                    when the cable came in that the Chinese, the PRC, had invited the U.S. table
                    tennis team, which was then in Japan, to visit China. I did a item in which I
                    started out saying, Ping, Pong-China Calling, and then went on from there. I
                    worked in the egregious pun about tabling tenets Communism, but people talked
                    about that for a long time after I wrote it. [laughter] I had a lot of fun
                    there.</p>
                <p>Q: So this office is, as it's watching the world, is another platform for bring
                    to the highest levels of the State Department various pieces of information and
                    trends.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, at this point in my career, I had no idea about the CIA's daily
                    intelligence report, and I didn't know that INR is doing the same sorts of
                    things. But this was the State Department's cables, that's all that we wrote
                    about. We were supposed to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Single source sort of editing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were supposed to boil it down to an 8-9 line paragraph. When I say
                    nine, we were supposed to have eight and we were allowed eight and a half lines
                    in describing the cable. It was good exercise in drafting because you had to be
                    very accurate and able to extract the critical elements and get them into your
                    eight and a half lines. It was challenging and interesting and it was the first
                    real drafting I did as a State Department officer.</p>
                <p>Q: This is one of the things I noticed moving from the field into Washington that
                    summarizing things succinctly became more and more important as you got closer
                    and closer to the seat of power.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: One of the other functions of the editor is that he made the initial
                    cable distribution to the State Department principles. We had slots for each of
                    the principles and I'm sure this would go to their office and I'm sure their
                    staff assistants and special assistants winnowed the cables we had included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the under secretaries and the deputy
                        secretaries...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: And the counselor... I bring this up because at this particular point in
                    time U. Alexis Johnson was the undersecretary for political affairs and it was
                    clear to me that we were overworking the man terribly. He was getting
                    everything. He was covering the whole shooting match, every issue that was of
                    concern to the U.S. government, he was getting the cable take. There was no one
                    else who was really doing that. No one else was reading...</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In any case, we had these instructions as to what peoplwanted, and he
                    wanted everything. No one else did.</p>

                    place is organized that you noticed from that vantage point?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I mentioned Al Atherton, and my calling him several times in the course
                    of a night and having him always invariably courteous and pleasant to speak to
                    even though he was being woken up every two or three hours. There other people
                    who were notorious s.o.b.s and you hated to call them. I used to say, this is
                    Ifshin calling from the communications center, I didn't want them to get my
                    first name or my name, I'd try to slur that as fast as possible [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Let me tell you another story. I was the editor then, not the associate
                    watch officer, one of our jobs, I assume it's not done this way any more, but in
                    those days, the classified phones we had very few in the department at that time
                    but there were several on the seventh floor. You had to change cards in them,
                    the crypto cards, at midnight or whenever they had to be changed at the same
                    time every day, and it was one of the functions of the editor to change those
                    cards. So we were somewhat familiar with the phones and the phone system. On one
                    occasion an office director had to call three ambassadors in EAP, and I was to
                    escort him to one of the phones, maybe the secretary's or deputy secretary's
                    phones, to make these calls. He had to convey certain instructions to them
                    orally. He spoke to McMurtry Godly and Ellsworth Bunker and whoever was in
                    Bangkok at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Unger, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Maybe it was Sanford Unger, I don't remember, yes. But he'd asked for Sam
                    Berger, but they gave him Ellsworth Bunker instead. He explained to Bunker who
                    was very upset about this, can't I give this to a secretary to write this down.
                    He said no under instructions from the President this has to be given to you
                    personally orally. This is most unsatisfactory, most unsatisfactory... he
                    subsequently ended up telling me Bunker's side of the conversation. And after
                    he'd made these calls and as we are walking back, he says, Gee I hope he didn't
                    get my name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any opportunity from the operations center to
                        toucbase with the NSC or the Pentagon equivalents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I actually was sent over to the Pentagon for a while and worked in the
                    National Military Command center where I was state rep. I'd said we had a 3-man
                    team...we had a 3-man State Department team, but there was also a military rep
                    who was a lieutenant colonel on each of our watch teams. At the National
                    Military Command center, there was a State Department rep, I think they had a
                    shortage and I got drafted to go over and do that job, although it was a more
                    senior job for a couple of weeks, a month, 2 months. It was one of the more
                    boring jobs I've had. Basically you look at cables all day and sit there. They
                    have a TV going so you can watch the news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't have CNN in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. It was an interesting thing that happened. This was the period of
                    the war of attrition along the Suez Canal, and it was the occasion where the
                    Israeli's shot down a number of Soviet pilots, although they were ostensibly
                    Egyptians, but they were actually Soviets who were flying the planes. And that
                    of course caused a great deal of interest and excitement at the time. I think
                    they subsequently did away with that position.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it didn't really amount to a whole lot. I remember on one occasion I
                    found a NODIS cable that had gone into general circulation and I had to make an
                    effort to recall that [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Well, there was a change. After I'd joined the operations center,
                    they made a change to make this a 2-year tour. And instead of a 1-year tour in
                    the operations center, people were supposed to then go out as staff
                    assistants...</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: SSS or Staff. Either. And among the people who served with me at that
                    time, Jerry Bremer who of course went on to exalted things after his service
                    with Dr. Kissinger. I'd already bid for language training and was very anxious
                    to study Chinese. They interviewed me, and I remember Karl Ackerman, who was
                    then the head of the operations center, said we'd like you to take one of these
                    exalted positions. I told him I really didn't think I was cut out for staff and
                    I was up for a line job. I was more of a hands on guy who wanted to get out
                    there and do my thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: See, Vietnam did teach you some things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter] These were all terrible mistakes in terms of building a
                    career, but I did what I wanted to do. I started Chinese. I was offered either
                    Japanese or Chinese at the time, I was given an option.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you choose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'd always wanted to study... I shouldn't say always, but at least since
                    my Peace Corps service, I had been interested in particular in the overseas
                    Chinese and was anxious to study Chinese. In fact, at that time, I thought I
                    wanted to study Cantonese, and they arranged a meeting for with Chas Freeman,
                    who was our great language guru although relatively a junior officer still. Chas
                    said, well, it's fine we need people who speak Cantonese, but you'd be better
                    off starting out learning Mandarin and mastering Mandarin first and then
                    studying Cantonese. So I adopted that as my goal and decided I would study
                    standard Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But prior to your Peace Corps experience in the
                        Philippines yohadn't focused on Asia or China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, it grew strictly out of Peace Corps. In fact, when I entered the
                    foreign service, I'm skipping around a little bit here, I told them I wanted to
                    serve in Asia... any place but Vietnam. [laughter] What I really saw with
                    Chinese in part, and of course at this time we did not have any relations with
                    the Peoples Republic of China, and we had a number of these listening posts,
                    these Chinese language positions around the periphery. While I recognized that
                    Japan was more important to the U.S. than China, and was likely to be so for
                    some time to come, at least from my point of view, it seemed to me that I had a
                    chance to serve in more places and it would be more fun to do Chinese. So I
                    chose to study Chinese. The year at FSI in Rosslyn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the linguist in Chinese at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Sollenberger, Howard Sollenberger. He was the head of FSI at that time,
                    but he was keeping his hand in as the China linguist because that was his
                    background. He had been a China linguist and he wanted to do that and he
                    continued to do that. I remember when I was just starting Chinese, he sat in on
                    one of my early classes and he listened to me for a few more minutes and he said
                    to me, you're from New York, aren't you? And I said, yes I am, how did you know?
                    He said I could hear your hard Ps. I said does this mean I'll never be able to
                    speak Chinese, and he said, no, it means you'll speak it with a New York accent
                    which is as good as a Minneapolis accent or a Dallas accent or a Los Angeles
                    accent, it's just another accent in Chinese. Not as good as a Chinese accent,
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>Q: [laughter] I was always under the impression that the accent one had was also
                    a function of the last language FSI had pumped into you so you probably were
                    speaking...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I had an initial problem in learning Chinese in that I had Vietnamese
                    tones. And Vietnamese tones are different from standard Chinese tones. They're
                    more like Cantonese tones actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Aren't there six tones in Cantonese and six in
                        Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think there are five in Vietnamese but I could be wrong. It's been a
                    while since I studied it. In any case, I made a very conscious, deliberate
                    attempt to try to block out my Vietnamese and try to master Chinese.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: When I started, there were four of us as I recall. Myself, and Ward
                    Barmon, a fellow named Phil Myer who subsequently left the foreign service, I
                    think that was his last name, and Tom Penfold who was really going to Singapore
                    and was just doing this to fill in a couple of weeks he had between various
                    other things when he had to leave or report, so they gave him a little Chinese
                    training. Ward and I were the only ones who did this for the full year. Then
                    Ward left for an assignment in Taipei and I went to the language school in Tai
                    Chung.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He gets one year and goes to Taipei probably in the

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I think he was in the economics section.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. And anything about that first year, about how interesting Chinese was? To
                    begin there aren't as many [Chinese] restaurants or whatnot in Washington.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter] Well, maybe not as many as there are now, but there were quite
                    a few. Matter of fact, one of the better ones The Shanghai, which still exists
                    out here in Northern Virginia. But it was a lot of fun studying Chinese then.
                    One of our instructors, well, they were both very nice, but one of them was Li
                    Tsungmi, I don't know if you ever studied with Li, but he had been a teacher of
                    Chinese in Beijing for FSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, in the late '40s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: So there was sort of a link there, you were in the middle of history and
                    that's kind of fun. I remember some of the anecdotes he would tell. He would
                    tell about being a member of the gentry in China in those days, and some of the
                    things he had done. It was kind of neat and interesting.</p>
                <p>Q: Now actually, the way the foreign service works is that you have to have an
                    onward assignment before you get language training, so you knew what job you
                    were going to...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't think I did at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the luckiest thing. [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't think I was assigned until I was in Tai Chung when was assigned
                    to Kuala Lumpur. I don't think I had an onward assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: In fact, while I was in Tai Chung, I think it was George Beasley. What
                    was the name of our... he subsequently went into USIS and had a successful
                    career as a USIS officer, a black FSO. But he was the scientific linguist in Tai
                    Chung when I was there. When I was about halfway through, so I guess I hadn't
                    been assigned yet, but he approached me and said I was making good progress and
                    wanted to suggest that I do a third year. I might possibly or would get into
                    translator or interpreter quality if I could do that third year of Chinese. But
                    I said I'm going crazy as is, and two years is about as much as my brain can
                    hold and I don't want to do it. I think that might have been a mistake because I
                    might have imprinted the Chinese in a real way, but instead what happened is I
                    had really decent Chinese when I left Tai Chung and it gradually declined.</p>
                <p>Q: [laughter] Now the foreign service for Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Arabic,
                    these are two-year programs. Generally, you do one year in Washington, one year
                    in a field location. So for Chinese, you did one year in Washington in '71 and
                    '72, and then FSI in Tai Chung in '72 and '73. Now if there's only one guy from
                    the first year program going to Tai Chung, how many people were in language in
                    Tai Chung when you got there?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We must have had 20 or 30 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In addition to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If that's the second year...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were people who were coming there not directly froWashington, it's
                    not always done as a 2-year straight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Refreshing one's second year...or they've had it one year
                        at previous time and now they're getting a second year...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Or they're coming back, or there are people who learn their Chinese
                    outside the foreign service. Of course FSI Tai Chung, I don't know about these
                    other languages schools that we run around for the other languages, but FSI Tai
                    Chung trains military and CIA and NSA personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of senior language, senior Chinese for the

                <p>IFSHIN: Right, a number of agencies were represented at Tai Chung in those days.
                    Now it's in Taipei. But that was an interesting experience too because getting
                    to know these people... Most of them are really like the foreign service, of
                    course the CIA guys are almost very little distinction between, you'd have
                    trouble picking one out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they walk with a limp, or? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Sometimes there's a difference, but the military types tended to be
                    very... the same interests and similar... The NSA were distinctly different, and
                    that was partly their insistence upon protecting their covers. They were all DOD
                    civilians as opposed to NSA employees and they'd all give you these cover
                    stories and expect you to believe them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What foreign service officers were with you in Tai

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't remember.. Peter Smith, he subsequently left the foreign service
                    and went to NASA where he was their Chinese linguist. He was there and he did
                    the 3-year program. I'm remembering more USIS people who were there when I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Rob Geary was there. John Thomson, John was one of the best Chinese
                    speakers we had in the program and he's really very good. It just popped into my
                    head.. Joe Lake was in Tai Chung the same time I was there. Joe and I became
                    quite close at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things I've always heard about Tai Chung was here you are studying
                    Mandarin Chinese which is spoken in northern China, and you are sitting with a
                    population that is Taiwanese and there are actually very few Mandarin speakers
                    in the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: A lot of your contact is with the faculty, the instructors, and of course
                    they are all Mandarin speakers by definition and speak with the proper accent.
                    It was interesting being exposed to the accents. I remember very distinctly...
                    we made a field trip to Taipei in which we were briefed by, I think the title
                    was the head of the mainland affairs committee of the KMT who was a native of
                    Hunan Province. He spoke to us for about an hour in Mandarin. We were all fairly
                    advanced in our course and some of us were quite good. I'm not including myself
                    in that. But I sat there and after losing track of what he was saying in about
                    10 or 15 minutes, I sort of wrote a note to John Thomson, who was one of the
                    best speakers in our class, and I asked do you understand what he's saying. John
                    said, no I don't. So we sat there for the hour and after it was all over we
                    asked our Chinese language instructor what language was he speaking? And she
                    said he was speaking Mandarin. I said, did you understand it? She said, I
                    understood about 75% of it. Of course that's one of the notoriously difficult
                    Mandarin accents, the Hunan accent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is Mao's accent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: You were a Chinese speaker, so you understand what I'm saying. I don't
                    think spoken Chinese is terribly hard. The great difficulty in Chinese is the
                    number of nonstandard accents and adjusting to those nonstandard accents. To me
                    that's the hard part of Chinese is understanding. So hearing a southerner speak
                    wasn't necessarily a bad thing, especially for someone like me who went off to
                    Kuala Lumpur. In addition to my Chinese, I tested in Hokkien Taiwanese, and came
                    out at a 1+, big deal. But that's what most of the Chinese in Malaysia speak. So
                    knowing a little Minan hua was useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found living and working in Tai Chung
                        comfortable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I enjoyed Tai Chung. When they approached me about staying a third year,
                    it would have been a second year in Tai Chung, I turned it down. But I had a
                    very nice time. I had a house. There was a large U.S. air base at the time, CCK,
                    and there was a PX and commissary and everything was available. I had a good
                    time. I don't know if I want to put this in the tape, but they used to tell me I
                    was making great progress in my Chinese, but how come I sounded like a bar
                    girl?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, it was already beginning to be successful and there was a great
                    deal happening in Taiwan. It was very comfortable living for someone getting an
                    American salary.</p>

                        this thNixon goes to China timeframe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Just to retreat for a moment, just during the time I was studying
                    Chinese in Washington, this is when Nixon's trip to China occurred. We then, as
                    the language students, were among the throngs who went off to the White House
                    lawn to see him off when he left by helicopter for Andrews Air Force base.
                    Subsequently I think Mike Mansfield accompanied him on that first trip. If not,
                    Mansfield went to China shortly thereafter. I always remember Mansfield came in
                    and spoke to our class about his experience of China, his impression. Which I
                    thought was a very gracious thing for him to do. He was the Senate majority
                    leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon's gone to China, and but in fact you are only 1 or 2
                        people in the Chinese course. It doesn't necessarily look like anybody's
                        necessarily looking to far ahead that there's going to be tons of consular s
                        and need for Chinese speakers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this get bandied about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, Chas Freeman wasn't senior enough at this point. [laughter]
                    Subsequently I had conversations with Chas about how a quarter of the foreign
                    service were going to be Chinese speakers, and we were going to have them all
                    over, but I don't remember when that happened exactly, that conversation. I
                    think that was somewhat later. We opened up the liaison office. But we had so
                    many Chinese speakers who had never served in China and were anxious to get
                    there. But I didn't compete for a job in Beijing. In fact, I went after the
                    Kuala Lumpur job, that was the job I wanted. I had this interest in the overseas
                    Chinese which I'd had for some time and that's what I wanted to do then.
                    Probably another one of my many mistakes. But I had a good time in Kuala
                    Lumpur... we'll get to that later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Not so much in Tai Chung which was then a provincial city,and I guess
                    still is. I haven't been to Tai Chung recently.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I first visited Taipei as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1965. When I was in
                    Vietnam I also visited Taipei. So, I'd been to Taipei a number of times already.
                    At this point, Taipei is a rather unattractive, a provincial city with rows and
                    rows of shop houses, the climate which hasn't really changed. In the winter,
                    it's this rather gloomy, gray, unattractive city and climate. But a lot of good
                    restaurants even back then. I think the food was better then, but the Chinese
                    food, back then there was more variety to it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No. The only place you could have a Western meal was at the various U.S.
                    military officers clubs. And maybe at the Hilton hotel. Basically you ate
                    Chinese food in Taipei, and it was great. Full of great restaurants.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Yes three 3+s, as I recall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, you had to take both and you had to be able to read the simplified
                    as well as the traditional characters. You started studying with the traditional
                    characters and then they introduced the simplified and you had to do both. At
                    first, it's I just learned this and now you're giving me this - this is a whole
                    different... But after a while you begin to see...</p>
                <p>Q: You begin to see the common thread. Now handling the jentizi, the simplified
                    character material, was not a problem, but something one had to be careful
                    of.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't remember. We were getting People's Daily, but I don't know if we
                    were allowed to bring it home from the classroom and just protect it. I had a
                    Chinese servant, I was going to comment on that. She was a marvelous cook. She
                    was from Szechwan and was just great. Here I was this single guy, and usually I
                    eat by myself. She'd make these fabulous meals for me, then stand behind me and
                    say it was too hot this time, I made it too spicy didn't I. I'd be wiping the
                    sweat from my brow and say, No, this is just the way I like it. Don't make it
                    any less hot. [laughter]</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: I don't know if I got home leave at that juncture or not. No, because I
                    had home leave before leaving for Tai Chung. As a matter of fact, when I was
                    supposed to leave for Tai Chung I was on home leave. And my father died in an
                    accident that weekend. I was leaving that Monday and he died on the Friday
                    before. Originally I was going to go to Europe on my way to Taiwan, I was going
                    to go the long way. But of course, I stayed with my mother and her family I
                    think a month or a month and a half, and then flew directly to Taiwan from New
                    York. I was pretty shook up at that point actually, I was in emotional
                    turmoil.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your foreign service assignment now is in Kuala

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it is a joint political/economic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No. We had three FSOs, and one other officer. And one other officer in
                    the political section. There was the chief of the political section, a Malay
                    speaker, and myself as the Chinese speaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So of the three, were you the lowest ranking, youngest

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you that meant you got to do the biographic reporting,
                        or...what were your duties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It's interesting, actually, because Kuala Lumpur or Malaysia, as you
                    know, the politics are very much ethnic politics. You have these Chinese-based
                    parties, and the Malay-based parties, even a couple of Indian-based parties, and
                    a few mixed parties which tend to be Chinese. So I'm basically responsible for
                    the Chinese parties. So in addition to the usual, being the protocol officer and
                    the biographic reporting officer and the normal cats and dogs, and map
                    procurement and publications procurement and those other good things, I had
                    these very distinct responsibilities for covering the principle opposition
                    parties then, as well as component parties of the ruling coalition. Which was an
                    interesting way for it to fall out.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>

                <p>Q: How did you feel? They were obviously older than you were by 30 years... the
                    aura of being from the American embassy can carry a young officer quite a
                    ways?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In Malaysia, then at least, the U.S. carried somewhat less weight than it
                    was to subsequently. They tended to be very British-oriented at that point. But
                    I didn't find any problem getting in touch with people. Maybe I dealt with the
                    second level people more than the first level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's good liaison anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: You have a very distinct portfolio and it's a crucial one. Malaysia has gone
                    through the insurgency period and they're trying to integrate these groups so
                    the trends and whatnot that you are picking up are telling. Where was Malaysia
                    at that time?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The traumatic event that pretty much hung over things was the '69 race
                    riots. Just to trace the history there, if you'll recall Malaysia was formed of
                    Malaya, Singapore, and Borneo provinces, east Malaysia. The Chinese-Malay
                    balance tended to be fairly close at this point. At least from the Malay point
                    of view, the understanding was that the Chinese would dominate economically but
                    they [the Malay] would dominate politically. Of course, Lee Kuan Yu was not
                    going to take a back seat to anybody. I think it's unrealistic to expect that,
                    and he was making a bid for power nationwide, so they expelled Singapore.
                    Subsequently the remnant Chinese still made a bid for political power and came
                    darn close to winning the '69 elections. The Malays came out and rioted and all
                    sorts of rules were instituted to ensure that the Malays would continue to hold
                    political power indefinitely. Plus the various, for want of a better word,
                    affirmative action programs which were meant to promote the bamiputra, the sons
                    of the soil, the Malay, as opposed to the other communities. And there was a
                    great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese. There were Chinese who
                    of course were interested in working out a different kind of accommodation and
                    there were Chinese who were interested in overthrowing things and radically
                    changing them. There were all sorts of movements and currents and developments
                    among the Chinese. And then quite a few Chinese were leaving, a big Chinese
                    emigration to Australia at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Q: So in fact from this position, you are talking to all kinds of Chinese groups,
                    not just the established political opposition. You're getting around town and
                    you have a fair arm around the Chinese community. What were their concerns at
                    this time, which is '73-'75?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, they were, what's our future in Malaysia. We've got it okay now,
                    but what's the future for our children was the major question. Are we going to
                    continue as second-class citizens here?</p>
                <p>Q: You're there through the American withdrawal from Vietnam, which is just up
                    the street, if you will. Is that impacting on the domestic situation in
                    Malaysia?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There was tremendous ferment in that part of the world at that time. I
                    remember... a little back-patting here. I was out on a trip when somebody threw
                    in some sort of anti-U.S. remark in the context of Vietnam. I was speaking to
                    some group, I don't remember what it was. But I kind of exploded and said, let's
                    remember the context of American involvement in Vietnam. You as Malaysian should
                    remember Konfrontasi and the Pyong Yang, Hanoi, Jakarta, Beijing axis that was
                    going to sweep Southeast Asia or Asia. America sacrificed to give you time to
                    build your country, etc., in fact all of the southeast Asia countries were
                    allowed to have that time, and now you have a chance to either use it or our
                    sacrifice has been in vain. It cost us a lot but you've gotten a lot out of
                    this. There was a lot of applause, and everybody was rah rah, and I felt very
                    good about it at the time.</p>
                <p>The other thing was we were dealing with boat people.</p>
                <p>Q: The fall of Saigon in April '75.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. A number of them evacuated to islands... Well, they evacuated to
                    Malaysia and the Malay government put them on islands. They approached us and
                    asked when are you going to take these people? We said we're not going to take
                    them until we at least have a chance to interview them, or talk to them. Well,
                    that was very unsatisfactory to the Malay government, they just wanted us to
                    take them, pick them up and take them home to America. Eventually we did get a
                    chance to talk to them and we formed a little team of about 4 or 5 of them and
                    went off to this east coast Malaysian location. It was an island offshore and
                    we'd take a banka over to the island every day to interview. We were staying in
                    a rather ramshackle government guesthouse on the mainland. I tell this story
                    because there was a fairly amusing incident. It's amusing now. I wake up one
                    morning and I have an enormous welt under my eye. I don't know what it is, but
                    it's this really ugly looking welt. It gradually goes down and I continue doing
                    my work. We go back to Kuala Lumpur and I see a British physician who was the
                    embassy doctor. He said, oh, it's a centipede bite. And I said, aren't centipede
                    bites supposed to be fatal? He said, well, sometimes... obviously yours wasn't.
                    [laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Q: [laughter] Well, let's look at the fall of Saigon for a moment. Saigon falls,
                    people start floating in to the isthmus both in Thailand, I was up in Songkhla,
                    as the counsel there. Were you aware of any interchange we were having with the
                    Malaysian government, or what was this and whose responsibility... and what
                    not?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't really tell you a lot more than I've already hinted at. They just
                    wanted us to take them. They didn't want to give us access. I know that, early
                    on. And our position was, well, we're not going to do anything until we've had a
                    chance to talk to these people and interview them. If we can develop that they
                    have a basis for entry into the United States, that is they have a relative, or
                    they worked for the U.S. or there is some other reason, we're not just taking
                    them. But if we can develop this, we'll take many.</p>
                <p>Q: As far as the way the embassy handled this flow of people... most of that fell
                    to the political section to report on the refugees, to carry the messages?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'd say it was a general embassy effort. The team that wformed included
                    me, a political officer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your Vietnamese...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I knew that, that's why I was on the team I believe. Although, as I
                    told them at the time, I'd made a deliberate effort to forget my Vietnamese when
                    I was studying Chinese. In fact, it was interesting how my Vietnamese came back
                    as I was hearing it every day. But we had an economic officer on the team, and I
                    believe a consular person. Maybe a USIS person as well. It was just an embassy
                    effort, we tried to get people to go off and interview.</p>
                <p>Q: With the American withdrawal from Vietnam, which is '73, I believe, are you
                    getting any feeling this is impacting on Malaysia. That they're thinking that
                    their situation is more delicate than before?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'm trying to remember when Sukarno was overthrown...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '65, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. I think they were really more relaxed than they might have been.
                    That really changed the whole constellation in that part of the world, when
                    Jakarta was no longer hostile. When Malaysia was no longer being attacked as a
                    creation of British imperialism. They now had friends and while they were
                    sympathetic to us, they were not as anxious about their own situation as they
                    had been.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Q: Your major reporting responsibility was the Chinese political parties. Did you
                    see opportunities to touch bases with colleagues in other embassies who were
                    also looking at the same issues?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, basically the Australians of course and the Brits havery good
                    contacts in Malaysia. And the Japanese on occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a regular procedure? In Beijing, we had Tuesday
                        monthllunch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No. They were a group of youngish diplomats who sort of hung out together
                    and gravitated together, but it was never... It was more social than work
                    related. Although as Al LaPorta, who was number two in the section, used to tell
                    me... I remember once something had happened, I can't remember what, but it had
                    us all puzzled and I would say I'm going to a party tonight and maybe I'll learn
                    something. The next morning I would come in and Al said, what did you learn? I
                    said, it wasn't that kind of party. He looked at me all disgusted and said,
                    Stan, they're ALL that kind of party. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] What did you think was America's priority in
                        Malaysiat that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Our priorities were almost strictly economic. Malaysia was a major
                    provider of natural rubber and tin, and we were interested in its continuing in
                    that role and being a trading partner of the U.S. Human rights did not exist at
                    that time as part of foreign policy. We were sort of interested in democracy,
                    out of our own personal predilections we favored those things. But our basic
                    interests were economic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just about the time you arrived...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Let me just mention that during the time I was there, our ambassador was
                    succeeded by Frank Underhill who had been political consular in Manila and then
                    deputy chief of mission in Seoul before coming to KL as ambassador. He was
                    really a brilliant political officer in many ways, a brilliant drafter, and a
                    lot of fun. Again, another anecdote just popped into my head. The South Korean
                    ambassador was calling on him. The Korean issue was coming up in the UN and he
                    had been to see the Malaysian foreign minister and had gotten their agreement to
                    support our position, that is the U.S. South Korean position. Our ambassador,
                    Frank Underhill, reported this conversation, whether the Malaysian said 'yes, I
                    hear you', or 'yes I hear you and agree with you', or 'yes I hear you and agree
                    with you and will do what you want' remains to be seen. [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Bringing it back to my Peace Corps anecdote about getting people to
                    commit. People don't like to say no in that part of the world. They will always
                    say yes if they possibly can, but what they mean by yes is another question.
                    Pinning them down and circumscribing their freedom of operation pretty
                    sufficiently so that you can be pretty certain of what they will do is the
                    trick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you arrived in KL, the Thai government fell. Did
                        that geany notice in Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: When you mention it, I have vague recollections, but I can't say that it
                    did. Part of my responsibility was to cover the area around Penang because it
                    was largely Chinese, so I would at least get that far up the coast. When I left
                    Tai Chung and went to KL I got a boondoggle in which I had stopped off in
                    Bangkok and Songkhla and the Philippines as well to discuss insurgencies and the
                    Muslim problems in the border areas. So I was aware of these problems and of
                    course they were always the Communist remnants in southern Thailand. But I can't
                    say that people were terribly concerned with what was happening in Thailand.
                    Maybe they were in the foreign ministry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As your first full tour in the foreign service, what did
                        yothink of your duties and what you were learning professionally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I found it professionally rewarding and very interesting. One incident
                    occurred when I was there which we have not talked about which might be of
                    interest, and that was the Japanese Red Army seizure of the American consulate
                    and the taking of the consul and other persons as hostages at that time. The
                    American embassy occupied the eleventh, twelfth, and penthouse floors of a
                    downtown office building. The Consulate was on the ninth floor, a suite of
                    offices. The Swedish embassy was also on the ninth floor, in an adjacent suite.
                    I forget what floor, but the Japanese were in the same office building. The
                    Japanese Red Army seized the consulate, and took our consul and a bunch of other
                    people hostage. I was happened to be outside the building when this all occurred
                    and there was a big mob scene in front of the embassy when I was coming back. I
                    spoke to police and they weren't letting anybody through. I called the embassy
                    and they said, go stay with our consul's wife. I went off, she was Latin
                    American, and I was doing my best to comfort here and various other American
                    wives started showing up.</p>
                <p>I went back to my apartment and spent the night in my apartment, a full night's
                    sleep. The next morning I got up and the siege was still going on. I went up to
                    the police and identified myself. They let me through and I actually went up to
                    the embassy this time. They wanted me to go down to the Japanese embassy to act
                    as liaison. I took a walkie-talkie and was in the Japanese embassy for the next
                    24 hours or so as this drama unfolded. What the terrorists were demanding was
                    the release of prisoners as I recall. Eventually, the Malaysians agreed to their
                    demands and the exchange was to take place at the airport where they were to get
                    a plane and fly off.</p>
                <p>I went off with our charge d'affaires, Bob Dillon, who was the DCM. I don't
                    remember if Ambassador Underhill was out of the country or what, but in any case
                    he was not there. I went off with Bob Dillon to the airport where the home
                    affairs minister was on the phone with various heads of state around the world
                    trying to persuade them to allow this plane to land. Eventually, we got Madame
                    Bandaranaike to agree to let them refuel in Sri Lanka. Colonel Qadhafi agreed to
                    let them land in Libya. Eventually we had our hostages released, and they left
                    with the prisoners. I think the prisoners had been flown in from Japan. They
                    wanted Japanese prisoners. They flew in from Japan and the exchange took place
                    at the airport.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think basically their political consular, more often thanot.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consular officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There was only one consul. It might have been Bob Stebbins. He was
                    released eventually. There was also an embassy employee who was taken hostage.
                    Everyone else was Malaysian, visa applicants of one sort or another.</p>
                <p>Q: Anything else about that full assignment that struck you as an interesting
                    description of either the foreign service life or how an embassy operates? Did
                    you get the feel that we did understand what was going on in Malaysia, that we
                    did have enough contacts?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think so. As I say, our interests tended to be economic rather
                    than political. But I think we basically understood what was going on and we had
                    a broad range of political contacts. More than I've seen in other places I've
                    served, in fact.</p>
                <p>Q: You're saying our interests are mainly economic and you're the officer
                    liaisoning with the large Chinese community which is economically oriented, and
                    I see that the next thing you're going to do is go to FSI for economic training.
                    Is there any connection? [laughter]</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, I thought, this is making me a well-rounded foreign service
                    officer. Again, this was lack of understanding of how the foreign service really
                    worked and what the foreign service wanted me to do. But I thought I should know
                    about economics and that would make me a better political officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I recall it was December of 1975.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did the January '76 FSI economic course?</hi>

                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, January to June. Six months.</p>

                <p>Q: I didn't either until I was looking at your scheduling. That's when I came out
                    of Bangkok, same thing. Political officer, doing political parties stuff and
                    realizing that what they're really arguing about is economic resources.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: I was thinking, “I better spruce up my economic background.” I begged my DCM
                    and he did some heavy shoveling for me and got me into that class. That was a
                    beautiful place. It was the most stressful thing I'd been through in a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I did very well in that class...</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think this had to do with the fact that I had a sciencbackground and a
                    math background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I remember everybody was in a terrible uproar about the math, and the
                    math was all stuff I had done before, so it was all review for me. So I did
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the individual courses came at a fair clip. In one
                        week thewould knock off a semester...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Sure. It was intellectually challenging and fun in that way. I enjoyed
                    that... and I think I got a lot out of it. I learned things which I think were
                    important to know and have stood me in good stead over the years.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm under the impression that when you talk about professions like the foreign
                    service, that education or continuing courses are important to help the mind
                    focus on things. Assignment after assignment after assignment gains a certain
                    amount of skills, but...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: What I did not understand was that by doing economic and taking an
                    economic assignment I was guaranteeing I would not be promoted. [laughter]</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: I was condemning myself to language and grade. But that's just ignorance.
                    I didn't get into the personnel system until toward the end of my career. That's
                    when I learned all this stuff. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of us never learned it. Just do a quick description
                        of theconomic course. It was six months long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, as you said, it included a number of courses and it's supposed to
                    be equivalent to an undergraduate degree in economics of about 20-24 credits of
                    economics. The math was basically at the differential calculus level so you
                    could handle statistics. I found it interesting and challenging enough and quite
                    useful. I think it gave me some intellectual rigor to back up some of my
                    prejudices.</p>
                <p>Q: As you said, one of the prices for getting into this course, and it was touted
                    to me as a real plum, certainly my DCM turned up to get me into it, but the next
                    thing you had to do was to take an economic assignment to pay your dues.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. I don't know what the foreign service had in mind. I think the
                    idea was that we would all become economic officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Of course, you and I did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you coned in anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: A political cone. I wanted to be a political officer. I would maintain
                    then and I would maintain now that the State Department or the foreign service
                    should really have a reporting officer cone, and an admin cone. I guess they
                    have moved to that to a certain extent. But that being a economic political
                    officer shouldn't be that rigid a distinction. You should be able to move
                    between both and do both if you're going to be a good political officer or a
                    good economic officer.</p>
                <p>Q: It's interesting that the term political economy is British, that's what in
                    the early days of British education, in the 19th century, political economy did
                    cover both what we now call economics and politics. It was the Americans and the
                    Germans who split the two apart. And then later you'd have political cones and
                    economic cones for the foreign service. So your reward for the six-month
                    economic course was...</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I went off to Jakarta as an economic commercial officer. My portfolio was
                    commodities. We had a petroleum officer, and that was perhaps the most
                    important...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were two guys. I'm having trouble remembering their names... I
                    think Larry Thompson was the second one. The name that is sort of on the tip of
                    my brain is Gary, was the first name but I'm not sure that's right [Mark
                    Johnson]. They both went on to have successful careers and occupy important
                    positions, but I don't have their names on the tip of my tongue now. In any
                    case, I did all the other minerals as well as timber and spices and basically
                    commodities. That was an interesting portfolio because those were important

                <p>Q: Basic to the Indonesian economy at least as it entered into international
                    trade. Who were the main traders on these economies? Was it the United States or
                    Japan...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Japan is their big maker and their big supplier although the United
                    States in the petroleum sector is the big player. I guess it's Texaco and
                    Chevron have a joint venture in Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Ed Masters succeeded David Newsom. David Newsom was there when I first
                    got there and subsequently Ed Masters became ambassador. He came from Bangladesh
                    where I forget whether he had been the DCM or the ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he was the ambassador because he was DCM in

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes I think he had been DCM in Bangladesh as well, which always struck me
                    as strange that he would go from DCM in Bangladesh to ambassador in Indonesia,
                    which I think of as a more important country. But of course, in Bangladesh we do
                    have a big complicated embassy there with a big aid mission. Anyway, I thought
                    he was DCM, but it might have been that he was ambassador.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I did. In fact a peculiar kind of expertise developed by
                    coincidence. I became our man in Irian Jaya. Freeport Minerals had their big
                    copper gold mine in Irian Jaya. I'm not sure if you are familiar with it. It's a
                    fascinating mine. It was developed... The mineral deposit was discovered
                    pre-World War II, but there was absolutely no way to access it. The mine was
                    built largely by Bechtel. It was really a product of Vietnam era technology
                    because they used helicopters to bring in the large earthmoving equipment so
                    they could start to build roads and slurry lines to access this mine. But it's
                    an enormously rich mine in the middle of the jungle and mountains of Irian Jaya.
                    I got about 2 or 3 trips there to see the mine and to visit an oil camp that was
                    in another part of Irian Jaya. So I had developed a sort of familiarity with
                    Irian Jaya. And the ambassador had scheduled a trip out there when they were
                    suddenly troubled with the OPM, Organizasi Papua Merdeka, which is still around.
                    This is the Popoem Freedom Movement. So the Indonesian authorities said the
                    ambassador couldn't go. And he said we have to have an American go out there and
                    check on the well-being of our American- (End of tape)***Q: Good Morning, it's

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, in our last session, a few names had temporarily escaped me and I
                    just want to fill in with those. You had asked at one point for the name of the
                    petroleum officer in Jakarta. The beginning of the time I was there it was Mark
                    Johnson, and he was succeeded by Larry Thompson. So those were the two petroleum
                    officers during my tour of duty in Jakarta. We had also discussed the head of
                    the language school in Tai Chung, and I described him and couldn't think of his
                    name at the moment. It was George Beasley of course, and I just wanted to fill
                    in with that. There are other names, but those two popped into my head while I
                    was shaving or brushing my teeth or other things during this past week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe again, is it an economic commercial section in
                        Jakarta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's combined.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. At least then it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how many... Were they all state people or were there
                        somcommerce people at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were no commerce people. This was before commerce took over the
                    foreign commercial service, or established the foreign commercial service. As a
                    matter of fact, when I first arrived, the head of the section was Erland
                    Higgenbotham, who subsequently headed the Foreign Commercial Service when it was
                    transferred to Commerce, but at that time he was a State Department Foreign
                    Service officer, as he was for the bulk of his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how big was the economic section at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was quite large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what, the mid to late '70s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it was really quite large. I can't really give you the exact number,
                    but it was like 7 or 8 Americans, officers, 2 American secretaries, as I recall,
                    and a number of locals of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretaries, what are those? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter] Well, foreign service secretaries... That's probably something
                    that perhaps I could comment on. This is only my second tour to Jakarta, I'm
                    ignoring Vietnam. But my second overseas tour. I had previously been in Kuala
                    Lumpur where we just had outstanding foreign service secretary after outstanding
                    foreign service secretary in the political section. It was amazing the caliber
                    of people we were able to attract in those days. I'm not putting down the people
                    nowadays - I don't know enough about them. But they were really outstanding.</p>
                <p>Q: I found it interesting, I think we mentioned it before... Chuck Cross has just
                    done his memoirs, and in his introduction section he lists all the foreign
                    service secretaries he ever worked for with a special thanks to them because
                    they did play an important role in all of our lives.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, and they were really first class, top notch people. Incidentally,
                    Chuck Cross figures in my story, but that's later down the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of quick ones... economic section vis-�-vis
                        politicasection size wise...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The political section was much smaller. There were fouofficers in the
                    political sections.</p>
                <p>Q: So one of the main... that's where we are representing one of the main
                    interests the United States had at that time was an economic commercial interest
                    in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think that's true. Of course there were other agencies, many of
                    them doing what should have been political reporting, or at least one of them
                    doing what should have been political reporting, as well as an important
                    military relationship and a large aid mission. In addition to that, on the
                    non-official side, you had a curious, I shouldn't say curious... a somewhat
                    unique... American oil companies had hired a former military attach�, who had a
                    very close relationship with a number of the Indonesian officials. This was an
                    important unofficial relationship. So the embassy wasn't the only American
                    representation in Jakarta at that time, and of course the oil industry was
                    extremely important to American oil interests. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were discussing some of your travels around Indonesia
                        tmines. You were just getting into a story about the ambassador's trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, well, the ambassador's trip was canceled or thIndonesians withdrew
                    the authority for him to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they control that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: For security reasons. I'm not precisely sure of what the formalities were
                    in terms of our travel. There's another incident in one of my first trips to
                    Irianjya. The reason I hesitate calling it Irianjya is the name is in flux. I
                    think the Indonesians are now calling it West Papua. The name has changed over
                    the years. This is the Indonesian half of Papua New Guinea, which only became
                    part of Indonesia in the late '60s when the Dutch gave it up after an alleged
                    referendum supervised by the United Nations. In any case, that was before my
                    time and I don't really know all that much about that.</p>
                <p>It was and remains a sensitive area. The very first time I went there, I went
                    there with the U.S. DAO in the DAO plane. We had first flown to Bali and then to
                    Darwin, Australia, then to Marouke, Indonesia. Marouke is just about the
                    easternmost city in Indonesia in Irianjya. When we arrived there the security
                    authorities apparently had not been informed that we were coming, although we
                    had informed the foreign ministry, perhaps somewhat late, that we had filed our
                    flight plans and we thought we were ok. We were not, I shouldn't say detained,
                    because we were never custody, but we had a long interview with the security
                    people and we never really got to see very much of Marouke because they were
                    busy interrogating us and finding out what we were doing out there. So that
                    illustrates the sensitivities that they had about the area. In any case, the
                    ambassador had a scheduled trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is about when... this trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't give you an exact date. This would have been during the second
                    half of my tour in Indonesia which would have been I suppose '78, around '78.
                    The ambassador had this trip scheduled, and for security reasons the authorities
                    informed him that no he couldn't go. He accepted that, but said that an American
                    consular official visit to ensure the safety of the American citizens in Irian
                    Jaya, and although I was part of the economic/commercial section, I had an
                    exequatur.</p>
                <p>This is a sidebar here... I'd never gotten consular training. When I joined the
                    foreign service, as is typical after your A100 course, you went through the
                    consular course. But because I'd been assigned to Vietnam, I was sent off for
                    AID orientation, and have never had consular training in my foreign service
                    career, although subsequently I have been a consular officer on many
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>But that was the first time. I had an exequatur. It's a very nice document by the
                    way, if you've never had one. I don't know what I did with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I got mine in Thai.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: So I went out there and met with Americans on severaoccasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of Americans were out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We had the Freeport Indonesia Mines, which we discussed earlier, it's a
                    copper gold mine. At least in those days there were still American nationals, a
                    moderate number of them, I really couldn't tell you if there were 10 or 20. But
                    it was something on that order of magnitude. They had, in what was called the
                    Bird's Head Peninsula in Sorong, in Irienjya, there was an oil camp where they
                    were developing and subsequently successful in bringing an oil field on line. I
                    couldn't tell you exactly how many Americans, but there were perhaps double
                    digit Americans there as well. And then, and this is the people we were most
                    interested in talking to, there were missionaries who in fact were in close
                    contact with Irienese and quite well informed about the feelings of the people
                    in Irian Jaya. I met with and talked to a large number of them. They represented
                    various groups. The people who were doing the Bible translation, it's a summer
                    institute of linguistics. They're in a number of countries.</p>
                <p>Q: So were there about 50 to 100 missionaries out there?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, you say 50 to 100, that's a wide range, but I think there probably
                    are at least that many.</p>
                <p>In any case that was the trip and I came back and wrote up what was going on.
                    There had been a couple of instances of violence on the part of the Organizasi
                    Papua Merdeka. Nothing really large scale and it certainly didn't threaten the
                    American citizens in Irian Jaya at that time. Nor did it pose a threat to the
                    province, but it was an indicator of the latent unhappiness of at least part of
                    the population within Indonesia with the Indonesia authorities. That unhappiness
                    continues as you know down to the present day where Irian Jaya remains an area
                    of instability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you made this trip were you using the defense
                        attach�'airplane or commercial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I recall that was commercial. I flew out to Biak, which is a large
                    island off the coast of Irian Jaya, which has a big airport because it was part
                    of KLM's Around the World flight back in the colonial days. They had built large
                    facilities in Biak. Jayapura was the capital, and so basically I got around to a
                    number of areas in Irian Jaya, covered the province fairly significantly. Then
                    in the course of... Basically the end of that story unless you have some other
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Q: Just a few details. You take a flight in, you arrive. What do you use for
                    ground transportation? Do you hire a taxi? Does somebody from the mine come to
                    meet you?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: When I arrived at the mine, I may very well have used mining company
                    transportation. I know on some of my trips I was met by helicopter. First I took
                    the company plane into the base camp and then a helicopter up to the mine. Other
                    times there was ground transportation laid on by the company. The same thing
                    with regard to the oil field where they laid on the transportation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the American companies were interested in having the
                        embassy know what was going on, see the environment that they were in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In this particular instance, yes. I say in this particular instance
                    because I wanted to make... this is a different story in a different industry,
                    the timber industry. There were two large American companies, and I don't want
                    to go into details as to which one had which attitude. Weyerhaeuser and Georgia
                    Pacific both had investments in Indonesia and one maintained fairly close
                    relations with the embassy and kept us very well informed, and the other did
                    not. And I was responsible for this area.</p>
                <p>On one occasion I mentioned that, gee we really didn't hear a lot from that
                    company and they didn't talk to us all that much, and they said that was a
                    deliberate worldwide policy. That they try to avoid identification or
                    entanglement with the American embassy and American officials, that they tried
                    to do things on their own. In many ways, this particular firm seemed to be quite
                    successful in operating in Indonesia. They had an ethnic Chinese partner who I
                    guess steered them through the difficulties of Indonesia. He subsequently, and
                    he's still around, that was 25 years ago, and he's still around but he's in
                    trouble because he was very much identified with Suharto and was one of the
                    people who were very close to Suharto.</p>
                <p>Q: So actually American businesses overseas have a variety of policies about
                    associating with the embassy or asking the embassy for help.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: They sure do. I think most of them, when they get in trouble, or when
                    they have trouble, try to see if the embassy can help them out and maintain good
                    relations, but at least some maintain a distance from the embassy as a
                    deliberate policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall at this time, whether there was an American
                        Chambeof Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh yes, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was significant. Again, it tends to be dominated by the oil companies
                    and the oil service companies because that's overwhelmingly the American
                    investment in Indonesia. But there were significant other extractive industries,
                    and that's the area I was working in, extractive industries, basically
                    commodities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're the commodities officer at this time, weren't there
                        whole series of required annual reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh there sure are. Yes. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That was a major feature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember what the names were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't remember what they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was a long list, very required, extensive
                        reports foCommerce and State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: For Commerce, and the Bureau of Mines, and for the U.S. Geological
                    Service. We were reporting to a whole series of different agencies. Again, if I
                    can relate an incident. We had a visit from an inspection group.</p>
                <p>Q: Foreign service inspector?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. A member of the group was Burt Levin who I had known in Taiwan.
                    When I had been a language student, he had been in the embassy as a member of
                    the political section. So I got together with Burt for dinner or something to
                    talk, and he was telling me, well, things are really changing in Washington and
                    we don't want to know about every sparrow that falls. Now we have to do more
                    analytical type of reporting, and the people on the seventh floor don't have
                    time to read all these trivial... The U.S. used to have to know about everything
                    that was going on everywhere, but that's not the way things are anymore and we
                    have to get away from that. I don't what particular thing had happened in
                    Washington that this was the line. I kept making the point that we don't just
                    write, at least in my job, for the seventh floor, certainly, and there are lots
                    of other agencies in Washington and a lot of our reporting is aimed at them. And
                    to the extent that we don't do it, they'll going to find other ways to get it
                    done.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Which I think is what happened over the years, we withdrew from certain things,
                    and they got their own people out to do it. I think that's sad in many ways. I
                    remember when I joined the foreign service, we used to make a big deal about it
                    not being the foreign service of the State Department, but it being the foreign
                    service of the United States. That was a part of our official designation and
                    this is what we were. We weren't just reporting for the State Department, we
                    were reporting for the U.S. government. I think it's sad that over the years,
                    we've neglected a lot of these functions, or that they got the impression that
                    we were neglecting them, and subsequently we were doing less and less of
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: It sounds like it was illustrated by the very commodities that you had,
                    because you are reporting to the Bureau of Mines, and sucking up everything you
                    can about the situation in Indonesia, not just for the State Department but for
                    all the other agencies.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's precisely what was going on. Although I'd had the economic courses
                    and I felt I wasn't totally uninformed about these areas and unable to report. I
                    was far from an expert on mining or on geology. But it was interesting. I
                    remember Shell was doing extensive surveys in Sumatra where there are apparently
                    enormous coal deposits. But they are very poor quality coal deposits. I remember
                    discussing it with them as they were doing it, and are they going to go ahead,
                    are they going to proceed with development, etc. And their bottom line at the
                    end of this was, yes, there is a coal mine in Sumatra, but not now. At some
                    point, the price of coal, and the state of our technology, is going to get to a
                    certain stage where it's going to be economical to develop this mine, but it's
                    not today. And it's not in the immediate future. They abandoned the project
                    then. I don't know whether anyone's picked it up in the years since. It was an
                    interesting lesson.</p>
                <p>If you remember, this is about the time of the Club of Rome and the stuff about
                    limits, and the conventional wisdom is that we're running out of everything. As
                    someone who knew a little bit about economics and was talking to these people, I
                    understood that we weren't running out of anything. It was a question of price,
                    determining the market, where it became feasible to develop a lot of these
                    mineral deposits, for example. The minerals were there. The prices were too low
                    at that time to develop them, but we weren't going to run out of them. At some
                    point, the price would increase to a stage where it was economically feasible or
                    economically desirable to develop that particular mineral deposit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your job as the commodity officer, did you liaise with
                        thIndonesian government or offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, I was...</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think frequently it was. You had some very sophisticated people. First
                    of all, on the oil side, of course, they had a very developed... now I didn't
                    really liaise with them, although there was a lot of the same people where
                    people were in the bureau of mines and their bureau of mines, and petroleum... I
                    think were in the same ministry. But for example, the people working in the area
                    of nickel, where Indonesia is a significant producer. Excuse me, I meant tin,
                    not nickel, tin. Indonesia is a significant producer second only to Malaysia and
                    the people in that area tended to be very sophisticated and had a good idea of
                    the market and what was going on. Perhaps not so much the mining aspect as the
                    marketing aspect of the industry, but they were sophisticated and understood.
                    And some of the other areas where Indonesia was a potential player but was not
                    yet into it, they were perhaps less informed. But we kept very close track of
                    mineral development in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>I remember a French company, I can't remember the name, took over a significant
                    American equipment manufacturer, and the Indonesia representative of the French
                    company used to come in and see me and talk to me all the time. I would talk to
                    him, and after a while I would say, “well, you're really representing the
                    competition.” But he'd say, “No, no, we have this American company” and I'd say,
                    “that's why I'm talking to you, but I feel it's a little awkward here.” He'd
                    say, “But the French embassy doesn't know anything. You guys have all the
                    information.” In any case, the equipment sellers would come in and talk to us to
                    see where development was going and what was happening and what was the likely
                    future...</p>
                <p>Q: You just said something that I thought was very interesting and that follows
                    my own experience, that even foreign businessmen would come over to the American
                    embassy to find out what's going on. Why wouldn't the French embassy or German
                    embassy know as much, was it a staffing issue?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think largely it's probably the size of the embassy, and I think they
                    tend to be more I think traditional in their approach to these issues. Whereas
                    we sort of had an interest in everything and wanted to know everything, and
                    basically treated much of this information of course as completely unclassified,
                    so we had all of these reports that we prepared that were just lining shelves so
                    that people could just come over and pick them up. I don't think any other
                    embassy was doing anything like that or anything near that. So if you wanted
                    information, the American embassy was the place to come by and get it from.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, your tour in Jakarta was coming to an end. Anything
                        elsabout the embassy at that time or the environment you were in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I really can't remember anything particularly exciting happening at
                    that particular time. Indonesia is a fascinating country. I felt that then, and
                    feel it now, it's really terribly interesting. Jakarta at that time was not the
                    most comfortable of cities. I understand it improved considerably in the years
                    after I left. I remember one incident where, I don't remember how it developed,
                    but one evening I was out and there was a traffic accident that involved some
                    non-official Americans, I think American teenagers, and as is often the case in
                    these kinds of countries, a crowd developed and there was a certain amount of
                    tension in the air. I remember grabbing these kids and getting them into police
                    custody. That's just an incident of something that happened. It kind of reminds
                    me of my Peace Corps days where we were under instructions that if we were ever
                    involved in an accident in a rural area of the Philippines, we were not to stop.
                    If there was no one around we were to stop to offer assistance, but if there
                    were people around we were not to stop but proceed to the nearest police check
                    point and turn ourselves in there, because there was a certain amount of danger
                    to being caught in those circumstances. I certainly felt at that time [in
                    Jakarta] that those kids were in danger or potentially in danger. But everything
                    worked out okay in that particular instance. I don't really remember that much
                    about it, I just remember that it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the embassy was receiving a number of
                        visitors,congressional or otherwise, in your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No. Not particularly, not at that time, not in our area.There wasn't that
                    much of that going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, your next assignment, from '78 to '80, is back in Washington. How did you
                    go about getting that assignment, or did it fall out of the air?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, no, remember, I had been on that job...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had open bidding at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, as I recall, we had open bidding, and I wanted to go back to
                    Washington. I don't recall where this was on my list of desirable jobs, but it
                    worked out very well for me. I was assigned to INR as a China analyst. Before
                    returning to Washington, I got a familiarization trip to China, this is '78, and
                    I went to Hong Kong and got various types of briefings and meetings there. From
                    Hong Kong, I took the train up to Canton and flew from Canton to Beijing, where
                    I was met by the embassy. Now the embassy had a big delegation, as I recall the
                    White House Science Advisor was heading a big delegation...</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, were you in that delegation? In any case, it worked out. It was
                    interesting for me in the sense that the embassy was all tied up in this
                    delegation and its care and feeding but I got included in their banquets, etc.,
                    and so it opened some doors for me and at the same time it left me free to do a
                    lot of things on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you are talking about your orientation trip
                        betweeIndonesia and Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one I'm thinking about was right after
                        normalization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, this was before normalization. This was still an embassy office; the
                    liaison office was rather modestly staffed at that time. They didn't have a lot
                    of personnel, so having a relatively large delegation meant that they were
                    really kind of tied up and didn't have really all that much time for me. So I
                    was on my own a lot of the time in Beijing, as well as elsewhere in China,
                    obviously. This was a fascinating time in China, things were opening up, and I
                    remember I'd go out to a restaurant, for example, and be seated at a table with
                    a bunch of Chinese. These were modest restaurants. So I would be conversing to
                    the extent that I could, I was somewhat out of practice with Chinese, but it was
                    coming back and I was trying to use my Chinese. I would be conversing, nothing
                    all that exciting with people, but people were talking with me. I even had
                    people stop me on the street and want to practice English, but learning I spoke
                    Chinese we'd go back and forth in the two languages and it was all very
                    interesting. I'd rush into the embassy the next morning, and I'd say, do you
                    know what happened? I did dot, dot, x, y, and z and this happened, and the
                    people would say, oh, yes, they just started doing that about a month ago, where
                    they actually stopped isolating us in a room by ourselves and letting us sit
                    with the other people in the restaurant. The liaison office people were not
                    astonished by what to me was all very new, and it was new, and it was among the
                    first times that it happened, but it wasn't the first time. So it was very
                    interesting, China was clearly changing. In any case, after Beijing, I went down
                    to Huangzhou and Nanjing where I visited various factories and schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All on your own.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I was traveling on my own. This was arranged through the Chinese
                    authorities, so I was met in every location with sometimes an official party. I
                    remember visiting a factory with a group of other people, I don't even remember
                    who they were, but they were other foreigners. And then we went to Shanghai and
                    from Shanghai I flew to Tokyo and off to Washington where I assumed my job as a
                    China analyst in intelligence and research. And it was a fascinating time to be
                    working on China because there was so much ferment going on at that time. The
                    Chinese media in particular were opening up and we were reading things that were
                    in fact news. It wasn't just a list of who had visited what cities and
                    pronounced things good, or bad as the case may be, and it wasn't just a matter
                    of propaganda diatribes. It was an actual discussion of issues and things being
                    written that were fairly astonishing at the time. We were all kind of, what's
                    going on in China?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a question that could in fact be answered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were convinced at the time, I remember, that there was secret democrat
                    that somehow-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] One of theirs or one of ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, no, it was [said] that there was somebody who was interested in
                    opening up the windows and letting some breezes blow through the... And
                    subsequently, from what we know, I would say Hu Yao Bang, who at this point, I
                    forget whether he was general secretary of the party at this point or became
                    general secretary of the party subsequently, but certainly from what we know
                    about Hu Yao Bang, he was a liberal in our terms. I always hate those terms,
                    liberal and left and right, when we're discussing these countries because
                    they're fairly meaningless, because we tend to call people we don't like
                    “conservatives” and people we do “liberals” and those terms mean nothing in
                    terms of actual policies and what they stand for. But it was an exciting time in
                    China. Back in Washington, we were supposed to have four China analysts at that
                    time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall who you replaced?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't recall if I replaced Doug Spelman or whether Doug Spelman was
                    there. We never had all four, we never filled all four slots during the time I
                    was there, or we never filled them with four State Department officers. During
                    the time I was there, sort of the constant was Carol Hamrin. Carol has been a
                    China analyst for the INR for a long time. I don't know how many years she'd
                    been there. She was certainly a young woman at the time. I don't know how much
                    experience she'd had. She had a Ph.D. in China studies and was very well plugged
                    in and she was there. Doug Spelman, I can't remember whether he was there or
                    subsequently left before I arrived. But I remember seeing Doug and meeting Doug
                    and working with him to a certain extent. At one point, Lilian Harris, and I
                    don't know what's happened to Lilian, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She moved on to Middle East things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. But Lillian joined us as a China analyst. That was after I'd
                    already been there for a while. And then we had various people who we'd borrow.
                    I remember somebody from the Congressional Research Service came over and worked
                    with us for a while. Someone from FBIS, one of the FBIS analysts, came over and
                    worked with us for a while. That said, I'd say that we had a very strong
                    analytical team in INR, and while there were many, many people in the community
                    working on China, some of them were outstanding, very knowledgeable, very
                    bright, very good in what they did, I thought INR stood up very well, because we
                    were all kind of doing everything, so we tended to be very well-informed across
                    a broad spectrum of issues. Where, I think for example in CIA, and particularly
                    in DIA, people tend to be more specialized and don't get the kind of broad guage
                    familiarity with issues in a country like China that you do working in INR. In
                    any case, during that particular period, I thought that INR was doing the best
                    analysis on China of any of the various intelligence agencies.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the stereotypes that I've always heard... the difference between a job
                    at the embassy or a job at the desk in INR, is that the INR analyst can sit back
                    and has a much more leisurely pace...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In terms of China, that's absolute nonsense. Again, this is the same
                    thing that I had always heard, that when you were writing something at length,
                    that no one was going to read it beyond the summary, well, maybe the guy in INR
                    would read it because he has time. Well, the guy in INR has no time. He's being
                    inundated with so much, on China at least, he's go so much to read in terms of
                    what is coming in from CIA, from other agencies, from the unclassified traffic.
                    And as I said, what was both FBIS and academic writing about China was being
                    published at that time was extremely interesting in the Chinese press,
                    especially if you were able to read it informed by the classified reporting
                    which we had available to us.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Yesterday, which is leaping ahead, but I was listening to a program about this
                    U.S. plane that had been landed in Hainan island yesterday, and somebody made
                    the comment that 70% of our intelligence about China comes from these kinds of
                    intercepts. That's nonsense. I don't know what the percentages would be and I
                    don't think anyone knows, and it depends on what you mean by intelligence and
                    how you are discussing it, but 70% or even 90% of our intelligence is
                    unclassified. If you know how to read the unclassified stuff and if you have all
                    the classified stuff to give you the background and help shape it, it really
                    helps opens up some new light on what is being published in the papers and what
                    they are saying in unclassified areas. But that's neither here nor there.</p>
                <p>Q: But that's important. Basically, the classified sets up a framework
                    which...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Absolutely, I'm not saying the classified stuff is not valuable, and when
                    I say 70%, maybe I'm just talking about volume and not importance, but the
                    numbers get very... Anyway I just heard that and reacted to it last night.
                    Getting back to my tour in INR, it was a fascinating time to be working on
                    China, and a tremendously interesting assignment. One of the things I got
                    involved in, this was the time of the China-Vietnam war. I see you are trying to
                    recall what happened there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was January, 1979.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. It wasn't the most important fighting that ever took place, but it
                    was an interesting time for us. In INR, in fact, the State Department never set
                    up a task force and never did anything to follow this as we often do for
                    international crises, but we set up one within our own office. I remember it was
                    basically myself, Rafael Ungerich, who was a Vietnam analyst at the time, who
                    subsequently has passed away, and Tim Hamilton who was the Thai analyst at the
                    time. The three of us set up a 24-hour watch, we were all working 16 hours a day
                    at that time, but we made sure somebody was on duty around the clock for the few
                    weeks that this lasted.</p>
                <p>Q: The stereotype of that action is that the Vietnamese used the national guard,
                    they didn't even bring out the army, and they gave the Chinese a very difficult
                    time.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the buildup, there was a long period before the actual fighting
                    occurred, we were doing a lot of fighting at that time, and I think I was among
                    the very first people to say that the Chinese were going to go ahead and do
                    something significant, because I thought it was obvious that governments don't
                    move this amount of money and equipment around without intending to use it, it's
                    very costly to be moving this. It seemed to me that they were going to do
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a recollection of the time line vis-�-vis Deng
                        XiaPing's trip to the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, well, he had come, and I think exploited his trip. I don't think
                    he told us a darned thing about what their plans were, but he made it look like
                    he had gotten American agreement. I think that's... Well, obviously he had
                    bigger fish to fry in the U.S.-China relationship than making it look like we
                    were supporting his efforts in Vietnam, but I think that was one of the
                    additional benefits he saw. Clearly, a very clever man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that buildup that you are watching, does that predate
                        hitrip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I believe it is concurrent. The buildup started and continued during his
                    trip and after his trip. Of course, the actual fighting took place and this was
                    a matter of... I think most people feel that the Vietnamese had the better of
                    the fighting, although it was taking place on Vietnamese territory, of course
                    the Chinese were the invaders. Then and maybe stubbornly, I've taken a somewhat
                    different view of it... at the time the Chinese were saying they were teaching
                    Vietnam a lesson. And my point of view was always that the lesson was not that
                    we could wipe the floor with you, but we're on your border, we're not going to
                    go home, and you've got to live with us. And that means you have to take account
                    of what we want. I think that was the lesson and I think the Chinese delivered
                    the lesson. But other people felt that the Chinese got their eyes blackened and
                    Vietnam had sent them home with their tail between their legs. Again, I never
                    saw it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a costly venture for the Chinese. They had
                        significanlosses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, sure, I think in the fighting the Vietnamese enjoyed more success
                    than the Chinese did. The Chinese learned a lot about their inadequacies, and
                    what they didn't have in the way of military strength.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you give us a sense of how projects in INR were tasked at that time? When
                    you arrived in the morning, did you know what you were doing, or you were
                    already working on something, or were there rush projects? The desk calls up and
                    says we want a study on...</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, they were always pressing us to do more in terms of longer studies,
                    analytical studies. When I say they, I mean our superiors. Particularly, now
                    there was a change in personnel which involves events. Shortly after I first
                    joined the office, David Dean became head of the Asian analytical area. David
                    subsequently got very involved during the time of normalization, with the
                    process of normalization, and emerged as the first head of the American
                    institute in Taiwan's Washington office, when the dust finally settled in that
                    area. Bob Drexler replaced him. I can't remember whether it was David and Bob or
                    mostly Bob who was always anxious for us to do longer pieces analyzing what was
                    happening in China studies. But at the time, we, the China analysts, the
                    shifting cast of characters with Carol and myself being the constants through
                    most of this period, did a lot of short pieces which went into the sort of daily
                    product that was being published for the secretary. We had pieces on a daily
                    basis, sometimes two or three pieces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, there was a daily INR report that goes up to the
                        seventfloor..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The secretary, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And INR/EAP was getting a fairly constant placement in
                        this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, normally, the size of this report varied, let's say a minimum of
                    five articles or as much as twelve or even larger than that. These are short,
                    one paragraph, type summary items, just highlighting important event. But of
                    that, every day there would be one, two, or three China items. It was just a
                    very interesting and important time in China where every day things were
                    happening, or we were learning of things every day. There was a constant debate
                    within China about policy, and about political parameters, opening up of the
                    system, changing of the system. And then we were always trying to see what was
                    happening on the personnel side of China, although that tended to be fairly
                    opaque and remains fairly opaque. We were always convinced that there was a
                    secret democrat and we were always debating who it was. At times, I think we
                    were way off.</p>
                <p>Q: So in some cases, you are deciding what you are writing on, say you need
                    something for the secretary's morning briefing. Things are coming down from
                    David Dean or from above. Is the desk asking for things out from INR?</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't remember ever being tasked by the desk. We were doing a daily
                    briefing, of course, of SI material for the desk, and had fairly close contact
                    with them. They always got the China items that we prepared for the secretary's
                    briefing. I don't think people get the whole briefing, or that they are
                    routinely circulated to the desk, but the specific items dealing with their
                    country would be given to a country desk. I can't remember precisely what the
                    procedures were then. During the Chinese buildup on the Vietnamese border and
                    the subsequent fighting, I remember we did several oral briefings for a variety
                    of individuals including then David Newsom who was Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs, and Dick Holbrook who was the EAP assistant secretary. These were at
                    their request.</p>
                <p>Q: You had arrived in INR summer of '78. And December 15, '78, Carter announces
                    that he's going to recognize Beijing. What were you doing on the 16th of
                    December? Does this pick up the pace significantly?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I don't think so. David Dean disappeared at that point, or shortly
                    thereafter, and got very involved in the mechanics of what was going on. I don't
                    remember it really changing things at the working level all that much. We
                    continued doing what we had been doing. Obviously we were doing a lot of sort of
                    reaction reporting and what is going on and how various people are reacting to
                    this change.</p>
                <p>Q: The change in diplomatic recognition, the derecognition of Taiwan and the
                    recognition of Beijing, would put Taiwan in an area that raised its profile for
                    us. What was going on there? Were you also doing background pieces on
                    Taiwan?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the impact there and how they looked at it...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the trends you were seeing out of
                        Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Of course, the initial reaction was one of tremendous dismay, and then
                    there was some violence, with demonstrations in front of the American embassy.
                    But I guess they came to terms with it. The handwriting had been on the wall,
                    and the fact that we were going to establish normal diplomatic ties with China
                    had certainly been in the cards with Nixon's opening in 1972. In fact, I always
                    felt that Carter-Brzezinski handled it in an unnecessarily clandestine type
                    manner. It seems to me that there was a tremendous concern about the Taiwan
                    lobby, or the China lobby as it was still called then. I think that concern was
                    probably misplaced. It faded and there was generally widespread acceptance in
                    the U.S. political circles that it made sense to establish diplomatic ties with
                    China. In fact, controversy did emerge, because I think what the administration
                    had in mind for AIT, the American Institute in Taiwan, and I'm not sure that
                    name existed at the time, but for that institution that there would be a fairly
                    minor operation that only concerned with conducting trade and other minor sort
                    of relations. Congress, in drafting the Taiwan Relations Act, played kind of a
                    useful role in outlining a much more developed and larger relationship. I know,
                    typically we don't like to credit the Congress with any kind of useful role, but
                    in this case I think they did in fact play a useful role, and what emerged with
                    AIT was a much better instrument for U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, INR is reporting on normalization... My impression is that there are a
                    fair amount of congressional trips and cabinet level trips that go over. Are you
                    doing any support of those? Background papers, or there was a standard
                    background paper already, the Chinese economy is...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think that tended to be fairly standard stuff. A lot of, for example,
                    biographical reporting came out of CIA, so that we weren't all that involved.
                    The desk was extremely busy at the time, and sometimes I suppose would levy a
                    requirement on us and ask us for assistance in putting something together. I
                    don't remember being all that involved in preparing for the trips. Though, you
                    are quite right, there was an enormous volume of them.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that happens in late '79 in Vietnam is the Kaohsiung
                    incident, which I presume is Taiwan processing its new relationship.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In part, but although obviously there were domestipressures there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Did INR get involved in any of that? Summarizing
                        anreporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'm sure that we did, but I honestly don't recall a great deal about it.
                    We didn't have a great deal of Taiwan expertise, which is kind of strange when
                    you think that's where we had our embassy all those years and people serving. I
                    think there was a general feeling that we knew Taiwan and we didn't know China.
                    That often seems to be the case... the more open a country is, the less a
                    feeling that we are depending on intelligence to tell us about that country.
                    Although, we are often more ignorant than we think. Q: Of course, that's INR's
                    forte, all the intelligence from all the other agencies is coming to one place
                    in the State Department that's INR, so you are looking at all sorts of
                    descriptions of things and summarizing that for the politically active.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely. There is an enormous volume of stuff that comein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this can be more than a 9 to 5 [job].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, this was a very involved, very interesting job. And you can
                    always take home unclassified stuff with you and try to do some reading at home
                    and stay abreast in that way. But the image of the relaxed INR officer having
                    time to sit back and read, at least as it applies to China, was a totally false
                    image. Maybe if you were working on, let's see, what would be a good country to
                    be working on? Some obscure country where we don't have to do a whole lot of
                    reporting, and you have time to read all the available material to read on it.
                    But that was not true about China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else that would have come out in that timeframe
                        onormalization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't recall a whole lot. There were a lot of interesting meetings,
                    intelligence community where we would all sit around and try to figure out what
                    was going on...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were a number of sessions where you would go over
                        to thagency and talk to their guys...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The agency, and I remember at least one trip over to NSA awell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You guys were busy, but did you get an opportunity to go
                        tacademic conferences, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, the Association of Asian Studies annual convention, in New York, as
                    well as events in Washington. We went around to the various sessions and
                    listened. It was all very useful, very worthwhile. I'm leaping ahead of myself.
                    I did a tour in personnel at one time and I'm going to get into this a little
                    bit more. I always used to advise people to look hard at INR jobs, which are
                    always difficult to fill, and nobody bids on them, at least that was the case
                    then, I assume it's still the case... I think they can be extremely worthwhile
                    and you could learn an awful lot on them. I've seen a lot of fairly senior
                    people, or people, particularly on the political side, who in my opinion didn't
                    fully understand intelligence and what it really was and wasn't.</p>
                <p>I remember when we were briefing, I mentioned during the Vietnam-China clash
                    period we briefed various high level officers. We'd always go through this is
                    what happened, and they moved 70 planes, and they had this capacity, and 700,000
                    men in these various locations and they had this and they had this kind of
                    support... I remembered that the questions always boiled down to intentions.
                    What are the Chinese intending? I was always willing to give people my opinion,
                    but I always wondered if they understood that that was exactly what I was doing,
                    giving an opinion at that time. This was not based on any special knowledge.
                    Their opinion was just as good as mine. If they wanted my opinion I was willing
                    to advance it, but I had no direct line to the Chinese authorities. They weren't
                    sending me a missive saying, well, we did this because we intend to do that. I
                    was guessing as to what the intentions were, or I was analyzing and trying to
                    figure out what the intentions were. But, having presented the information to
                    them, presumably they were as well placed as I was to figure out the
                    intentions.</p>
                <p>Q: The point is, it's worthwhile to have an understanding of the intelligence
                    that's coming in, its capabilities and what it's able to do for you because at
                    some time in your career as an action officer you're going to have to move on
                    the basis of that intelligence.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely. And it's also important to understand the limitations of
                    intelligence and how often we are operating in a murky situation and
                    intelligence doesn't tell us what we need to know. We have to figure that out. I
                    don't know if you have any other questions, but just preceding, the other
                    interesting thing about the INR job is that coming out of that job I had very
                    good contacts in the China area across a broad spectrum of persons and there was
                    a great deal of interest in me for my next job, which is a fairly unique
                    situation at that time. And I remember that originally I had wanted to bid on
                    Mark Pratt's job, that is the job of the general affairs political section chief
                    in Taipei, and Mark extended [his tour], so I thought, well, I'm not going to go
                    after that job.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Then I was approached by Chas Freeman. I guess he was the director of the desk,
                    and he wanted me to bid on a political section chief job on the desk. So I went
                    to personnel to talk to them about bidding on that job, and I said, well, you
                    know, the desk has talked to me about this and they want me to bid on this job
                    and it sounds like it would be a good job. And they said, yes, well, except that
                    it doesn't exist. I said, what? And they said, well, they're trying to create it
                    and they'll probably be successful, but at this time, there is no job so there's
                    nothing for you to bid on. I guess the reason I went to see them is that I'd
                    tried to enter a bid and had not been successful, and that's why because the job
                    was not in the system yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's funny because I thought Gerry Ogden was
                        sitting athat job. Or Gerry was his deputy at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I guess, well, in any case, this was a new job that did not exist, and at
                    this point I got very upset and said, well, here I had this job and I let that
                    go, and then I had that job, and the job I really wanted was Mark Pratt's job
                    and now he's extended, and now you're telling me this job doesn't even exist.
                    And they said, well, wait a second, we can give you Mark Pratt's job, we just
                    have to figure out what we're going to do with you for a year. I said, oh, I can
                    still bid on Mark Pratt's job? They said, well, it's a language job and it's
                    still listed and you can bid on it. Ok, what are we going to do with you for a
                    year? There were several possibilities, and then they mentioned they had a
                    vacancy for the commercial officer position in Taipei. I said, oh, I have an
                    economic background, I did economic commercial work. So I can go to Taipei and
                    do that job.</p>
                <p>So that's what I did, I went off to Taipei for a year as the commercial officer
                    which was again a very interesting job. It was a new experience for me. There
                    was a trade center there and there were two commerce department officers there
                    and I was the State Department officer, and of course we were all AIT at that
                    point, we'd resigned from our various agencies...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, explain that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The procedure at the time, you submitted a letter of resignation and it
                    was understood that you would come back to your agency. It was interesting
                    because we continued to earn seniority, we continued to have money paid into our
                    pension fund, so this resignation was a strange one in many ways, and I'm not
                    sure of what the legalities of it were. But in essence, they withdrew your
                    diplomatic passport and gave you a so-called green passport, a normal tourist,
                    civilian type non-governmental passport.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Q: My understanding was that the executive branch's version of the Taiwan
                    Relations Act was done by a few lawyers in a back room to basically accomplish
                    this. Take foreign service officers who had presidential commissions. Suddenly
                    wash them, they resign from the foreign service, they happened to be picked up
                    by this contractor, called AIT, perform very similar foreign service like
                    duties, and at the end of their contract with AIT they can be rehired by State
                    Department. That apparently was the original version.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Again, this gets into my future reincarnation as a personnel officer as a
                    career development officer. I had some dealings with people who served in the
                    Sinai field mission. The situation that I subsequently discovered there, for
                    example, I had young officer who I was the career development officer for who
                    was promoted during the time he was in the Sinai field mission, but the
                    promotion did not take effect while he's there. It only takes effect when he
                    rejoins the State Department. So that subsequently, he lost pay and he lost
                    various other things, eligibility to compete, all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>I remember at the time I went through the system, and spoke to someone, and said
                    I served in AIT and none of this stuff worked that way. We got everything. [If]
                    We got promoted, we got promoted and we started earning our new salary and we
                    started earning seniority in our new positions. Why is Sinai Field mission
                    position being treated so differently? Subsequently, and retroactively, they
                    went back and straightened it out with the Sinai field mission so that they were
                    treated much more fairly, I think, in those terms.</p>
                <p>Q: Actually, that impacts on the whole AIT thing too, because when they created
                    this AIT, nobody knew how it was going to work, nobody knew what the impact was.
                    In fact, at the time didn't they tell people who were at the embassy that if you
                    want to leave and not sit this out, you may do so. Mark extended, but maybe he
                    didn't bid fast enough, did he extend because he was enjoying it or they were
                    afraid there wouldn't be any bidders?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't know, but maybe he was prevailed upon that this was a very
                    important and delicate time in Taiwan-U.S. relations and it was very important
                    that continuity be maintained. For example, Chuck Cross was brought in as the
                    first head of AIT and again, that was sort of they wanted somebody of
                    ambassadorial rank who had been an ambassador previously. There were all sorts
                    of issues attached to what they were trying to do.</p>
                <p>Q: So, what you've done now is gotten yourself assigned as Mark's successor, but
                    you do the year on the commercial side to position yourself.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Q: So you've actually got two assignments.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how was that commercial year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was an interesting year. First of all, you have an important
                    commercial relationship with Taiwan, as well as just an important relationship
                    in general. The U.S. figures very large in the Taiwan universe, in the Taiwan
                    scheme of things. So being the commercial officer, I was important to a lot of
                    Taiwan businessmen. In addition, I had a really outstanding staff. I had a
                    number of Taiwan locals working for me who were just extremely able and quite
                    familiar with what they were doing, quite capable people. I went over...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you working in the economic center or the trade
                        center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'm in the trade center, physically located in the trade center, although
                    my boss is in the economic center. I'm working for Sam Lee, who was a U.S.
                    foreign service officer. Sam was State Department, I don't know if the foreign
                    commercial service already existed at this point, I don't know when exactly that
                    arrangement took hold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember who you replaced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: When we met Stu Kennedy, I was saying he had served in Taiwan because I
                    would swear that was the name of the person I replaced. I thought the name was
                    Stu Kennedy but I've forgotten now. I don't think he was particularly a China
                    type, the person I replaced.</p>
                <p>Q: Can you describe some of your duties?IFSHIN: With this excellent staff that I
                    had, my duties were to brief American businessmen on the ongoing economic
                    relationships and business opportunities and to identify business opportunities
                    for Americans. We maintained a commercial library, largely for Taiwan
                    businessmen looking for agents or to be agents or representatives of American
                    businesses and to import the American products as well as to find
                    representatives for their exports in the United States. We had various trade
                    shows, those were largely the two commerce department persons who were
                    responsible for the trade shows. I was responsible for the day-to-day
                    facilitating of American and Taiwan businessmen finding each other and doing
                    business with each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a fair string of American businessmen coming to
                        Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. That was still quite prevalent. Taiwan was then our fifth or sixth
                    largest trading partner. An awful lot of it was Taiwan exports to the U.S., at
                    that point they were running a big surplus. I don't know if they still do, but
                    they were always interested in whittling down that surplus, from their own
                    self-interest point of view of showing what valuable customers they could be as
                    well as sellers of products. There was a significant commercial
                    relationship.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sounds like there would be a fairly large American
                        chamber ocommerce.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, there was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larger than Jakarta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Certainly more heterogeneous. Where Jakarta tended to be dominated by the
                    petroleum sector, this was a broader spectrum of companies and interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that most of the local businessmen were
                        Taiwanesas opposed to mainland Chinese that were running the
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. Certain sectors had large mainland representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Banking. China Airlines which largely comes out of the air force and is
                    kind of operated as a fully owned subsidiary of the air force, so that tended to
                    be mainland Chinese. But business, by and large the private sector, was then
                    largely Taiwanese. But there were certain important businesses that were
                    mainlanders' ownerships, just certain companies were traditionally
                    mainlanders.</p>
                <p>Q: Banks are sort of choke points for small businesses... if you can't get your
                    loan..., I wonder if that's one of the reasons the mainlanders were into
                    banking, it also served a political purpose.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't think it was established in that way. A lot of the banks came out
                    of the government, or were originally government owned, or were then government
                    owned or controlled. And then you had the big Shanghai banking sector which had
                    moved with the nationalist government. Taiwanese were increasingly involved in
                    banking types of things, but I think they tended to have a slightly different
                    legal personality than the traditional banks. They tended to be trusts. Whatever
                    the distinction is, really, is not something I'm terribly familiar with, but
                    like we had savings and loans, they had some other entity.</p>

                <p>Q: While you are there in the commercial side, you were saying that the
                    government on Taiwan wanted to be a good customer to the U.S. Do you remember
                    any trade disputes or major things like that that came up, or major
                    purchases?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I honestly can't at this point. It's all kind of faded. When I was
                    writing my, or making input into my EER, I was responsible for enormous amounts
                    of Taiwan purchases, but I honestly can't remember any of them now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they starting or had they been doing this trade
                        delegationto the states? The different buying delegations...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, yes. During that year, this was a big thing where we had a number
                    of states visit Taiwan state delegations and they would also send Taiwan
                    delegations to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My point is, did that start with derecognition, or had
                        they beedoing that state buying things at an earlier time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I honestly cannot tell you. It was ongoing during the time that I was
                    there and it's hard for me to believe that they just ginned it up so quickly.
                    But it was an increasingly important instrument of policy for the Taiwan
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain how they used that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Having lost the formal diplomatic ties with the U.S., they were
                    interested in promoting all kinds of Taiwan sister city relationships, sister
                    university relationships, sister this, sister that. Or they would entertain
                    these trade groups from various states. I remember South Carolina coming out and
                    was headed by then Governor Richard Reilly, the man who was just Clinton's
                    secretary of education. But there were a number of others that came through
                    during the time that I was commercial officer, it was fairly common. Lots of
                    exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Taiwan would send these buying delegations to the
                        stateand announce the purchase of wheat or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't know how much of this was actually additional purchases beyond
                    what they would have been making in any case, but they would try and make it
                    look like they were making a big gesture by announcing them together in large
                    amounts, just in the normal course of events we bought so much wheat. Instead,
                    they would give us some publicity and some play and do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Q: Now, as commercial person for that year, did you have much opportunity to
                    drive around the island for business, visiting other businesses, talking to
                    people, or were you mostly in Taipei?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I recall, I was mostly in Taipei. Although, I remember going down to
                    visit some of the significant businesses that were somewhat south of Taipei, in
                    the Taipei suburbs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chin Hsu industrial park?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, the industrial park, and the China petroleum company which is
                    located outside of Taipei and a number of entities like that, but it was
                    basically confined to the Taipei area. I must have gone down to Kaosiung to the
                    trade center down there, but I don't remember a whole lot of travel. I had been
                    around the island a number of times before I got there. As a language student I
                    traveled extensively in Taiwan. We were encouraged to travel, in fact, we were
                    given a lot of time to travel. As long as we were using the language we were
                    supposed to get out. I'd been all over the island. I mentioned Burt Levin...
                    when I arrived as a language student... I'm going back now... Burt made a
                    comment that he wished he could take me around the island sometime, or that I
                    could go around the island sometime. I don't know how sincere he was in saying
                    that, but when I got down to Tai Chung, I told George Beasley that Burt Levin
                    said he wants me to travel with him around the island. George said, that's
                    great, sure. A month or two, three months after you've been here, that'll be
                    fine. So I contacted Burt and said, remember that trip you wanted take? George
                    Beasley says it's fine. So we took a trip around the island together, starting
                    from Tai Chung and went around to Tai Nan and Kaosiung, and Taidong, and up the
                    coast to Keelung.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Visiting the government people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Visiting government people, opposition people and calling oall sorts of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, as a language student, you got an enormous
                        introduction tTaiwan and its politics..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, given that introduction and the introduction you
                        would havhad to Taiwanese businessmen in the year...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I found the introduction to Taiwanese businessmen extremely interesting
                    and I think it was useful in filling in a lot of background for me in my
                    subsequent job as the chief of the general affairs or political section. The
                    businessmen for the most part avoided politics like the plague. This was the
                    time when the Kuomintang was running a pretty tight ship, and it was not
                    necessarily...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your arrival was after Kaosiung, which is a signal,
                        therounded up the entire opposition. They're all in jail now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. It was not economically healthy to be involved in politics for
                    businessmen. But nonetheless, I got to talk to a lot of businessmen and
                    establish a certain relationship with them where they felt a little bit more
                    open and willing to talk. While they weren't talking politics per se, a certain
                    amount of the unhappiness that they had with the prevailing political structures
                    came through and they felt comfortable enough to hint at some of these things.
                    It was a good background, that commercial officer tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that tour, what was your liaison with the local
                        authorities?Were you going over to their department of commerce? (End of
                        tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You were just coming to the end of your commercial tour.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: At that time we were pretty religious about not contacting the
                    government, although I think it was somewhat more relaxed on the commercial area
                    than the political area in our dealings with the foreign ministry. Nonetheless,
                    we worked basically with the CCNAA (Coordinating Council for North American
                    Affairs). I had a really outstanding team of locals working for me who conducted
                    a lot of more official relationships, but I didn't know about that and didn't
                    try to know about that.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you come across a circumstance where the authorities on Taiwan wanted you
                    to attend something or do something that was a little more official? Were they
                    making the attempt that the relationship was more official than the Americans
                    wanted it to be?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't recall that when I was working in the commercial area. Now I
                    would refer businessmen to the Taiwan authorities at times because they needed
                    to deal with them, and I would have one of my locals help facilitate such a
                    meeting. But I don't recall them ever trying to exploit that to get me involved
                    to make that relationship look more official. I don't recall anything like that
                    ever happening.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it's 1981, and Mark is leaving. He had been in place

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there after normalization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: So you are the first general affairs section chief in this new period, if you
                    will. What kind of a political relationship did Mark turn over to you?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, well, I think we operated very much like a normal political section
                    would. We didn't meet with the foreign ministry per se, but in a sense, that
                    was, we dealt with CCNAA, and in a sense that was more like a traditional
                    embassy. The embassies of course tend to contact every ministry, and be in
                    contact with all sorts of people. But the more traditional embassy goes through
                    the foreign ministry. We were going through the CCNAA which was acting exactly
                    like a foreign ministry, and whenever we needed to contact anyone, that's the
                    way we did it. In addition of course, we were meeting with the opposition. You
                    mentioned the Kaosiung demonstrations and subsequent arrests and imprisonment of
                    a number the significant leaders of the opposition, nonetheless, the opposition
                    continued to function in despite of the absence of many of these leaders,
                    although, I always feel that there were a whole number of people I don't really
                    know because they were in prison, a whole bunch of significant leaders.
                    Nonetheless, I became familiar with the people who were carrying on at that
                    time. Some of them were very interesting people to get to know. Taiwan is a
                    place that is undergoing very rapid change, political and economic, and it is
                    always interesting to watch that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: You know, as I mentioned earlier, Chuck Cross was the first head of AIT,
                    and he was the head during the time that I was there as a commercial officer,
                    and I can't remember exactly what the transition was, and he was replaced

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Jim Lilly, and I can't remember whether Jim Lilly and I assumed our
                    positions more or less concurrently or whether it's just fading in my mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Q: Because actually, Jim Lilly is as the Reagan administration comes in and Jim
                    is basically NSC to start off the administration and then he gets that job. So
                    if they came in at '91...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: '81...</p>

                        comes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think Chuck Cross must have been in place when I first took over
                    in the general affairs section, but it wasn't very long after I was in general
                    affairs that Jim Lilly took over. I can't remember... Stan Brooks replaced Bill
                    Thomas as the deputy and I can't remember what the exact timing of that, either.
                    Bill Thomas was certainly there when I was commercial officer and I think for a
                    while when I was general affairs. I think Stan Brooks replaced him some time
                    after I had already become general affairs officer. But it was all more or less
                    about the same time, the changing of the guard so to speak takes place.</p>
                <p>Q: So we have a fresh crew after this traumatic event. Do you have any sense of
                    either Chuck Cross or Jim Lilly's connection with CCK at that time?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Let me just say that when Jim Lilly came on board, I remember attending
                    some meetings with him and the Taiwans and CCNAA personnel, I believe, where he
                    used what I thought of at the time as kind of retrograde language that sort of
                    set my teeth on edge... he was talking about the Chi Coms and various stuff out
                    of the '50s and I really had to sort of, what's going on here? But I became a
                    big fan of Jim Lilly's and he's a very capable guy, and a lot of that stuff I
                    think was meant to kind of put the Taiwans at ease and kind of establish, 'hey,
                    we speak the same language here and we all know about the Chinese bandits or the
                    communist bandits and you can relax with me'. He was extremely effective with
                    the Taiwans, with Kuomintang, and with the opposition figures as well, just kind
                    of putting them at ease, and making them recognize him as someone they could
                    talk to. I admired him, watching him operate. As I said, my initial reaction had
                    been a little bit of being appalled at some of this, but he was very good.</p>
                <p>Q: There's obviously a number of tensions going on, I mean there's the whole
                    emotional reaction to the derecognition, and then there's the internal political
                    turmoil, which is Kaosiung and the subsequent trials. How did your reporting
                    priorities reflect some of this?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Our reporting priorities tended to be focused on Taiwan, China, well,
                    Taiwan-U.S. was always our main priority, and Taiwan-China was a second
                    priority: how is that relationship evolving. And somewhere much farther back was
                    how is Taiwan's internal politics evolving? That was of particular interest to
                    me, and was of a higher priority to me than it was to the U.S. government, but I
                    was very interested in Taiwan's internal politics and how that was evolving.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I tried to develop relations with both opposition figures and with
                    Kuomintang figures, particularly the Li Teng Hui kind of Taiwan KMT, the bulk of
                    the Kuomintang membership of course at this time was Taiwanese, although the
                    leadership was still largely mainland. One of the things I kind of regret was
                    that I never really got to know James Sung who was then in Tai Chung, where he
                    was the governor, and the...</p>

                        GIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Head of the government information office, but most of the time that I
                    was in Taiwan, he was not in Taipei, so I really didn't get to know him very
                    well. I did get to know, his successor as governor, who was a Taiwanese, Lin
                    Yang Gang. I got to know him a little bit and I got to know some of the other
                    people who I identified as movers and shakers. I had this thesis for a long time
                    that Taiwan mainland relationships would only be worked out at a period when you
                    had an indigenous Taiwanese leadership that would be comfortable and would be
                    seen by the Taiwanese population as representing their interests in a way that
                    the CCK and the mainlanders never could. I always felt that they would be seen
                    by the Taiwanese as trying to work out some sort of deal for themselves, whereas
                    if you were a Taiwan politician, then at some point most of the people would
                    accept that you were trying to work out something on their behalf as well as
                    your own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, doesn't this come from the fact that it was the
                        KMposition that there was but one China and Taiwan is part of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I thought there could be a deal at some point, but that it required a
                    leadership that was in some sense democratically selected by the majority of the
                    population by the Taiwanese, or at least seen as representing the Taiwanese. I
                    still feel that, and that is obviously the way that things have evolved to a
                    certain extent, but it's not been as simple as I thought it would be. For one
                    thing, I expected the Chinese to be more pragmatic than they've proven to be. I
                    think they've gotten more ideological, nationalistic, perhaps as Communism lost
                    legitimacy as an idea, then they've had to depend on nationalism as their
                    authority and that's complicated any attempt to work out relations with Taiwan.
                    I thought this evolution of Taiwan's politics was critical to the evolution of
                    Taiwan. Obviously it would be critical to the evolution of Taiwan-China mainland
                    relations.</p>
                <p>Q: Now along these lines, I remember reporting out of Taiwan that would indicate
                    that OCKs put another Taiwanese guy as the head of something... the
                    Taiwanization of the KMT and the legislatures that was something that people
                    were watching. Were you seeing that at the time?</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, well, it was moving very slowly. The legislature, through the whole
                    period I was there, and I don't know exactly when the change comes, but the
                    legislature was the legislature that represented mainland China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the election of 1947.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. When somebody died, they would replace him with someone who ran
                    second if he was living in Taiwan. It was incredible that they were able to
                    maintain this for as long as they were. They had all these ancient politicians
                    who were extremely long-lived who managed to hang on there. It was inevitable,
                    you knew that there were demographic changes that were coming because people do
                    die, but it was hard to see just when it was going to change and how it was
                    going to change. So the legislature tended to be less interesting than what was
                    happening within the party, the KMT...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The party was the focus of much of your reporting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, and then you had the opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in a professional sense, you had been there a year,
                        and Mark had been there three years. When you take over, is there a quick
                        handoff, or he's been including you in the last few months in his meetings
                        and everybody knows you are taking over, or is it as though you just walked
                        in from a different world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: A lot of people knew I was taking over. In fact, I guess it had become
                    common knowledge. I had not tried to broadcast it. And once I heard my locals
                    talking about it, and I misunderstood what they were talking about because they
                    used terminology that was not clear to me about a promotion or something, and I
                    didn't know what they meant by I was getting promoted. I was hoping that they
                    had some secret that I didn't know about. But of course, what it was they knew
                    about my move to general affairs, and I hadn't told them, I hadn't told anyone.
                    But it was common knowledge coming out of the personnel section of AIT, and
                    obviously it got from there into the general community, and people knew it was
                    happening and then it did happen. I think the handoff was sort of a mix between
                    what you described as sort of a handoff and gradually working me into things. It
                    was neither, but somewhere in between, there was a certain amount of
                    introduction, but it was done basically at the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does a general affairs section look like? How many
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: At that time, we had four American officers, including myself. One
                    officer from another agency, and two junior officers, they were both second tour
                    officers. Can't remember whether I inherited them or if they arrived after I got
                    the job. I don't remember anybody before them, so I must have inherited them.
                    And as with the luck of the draw, one was very good and one was not so good.
                    There were two secretaries. I had a staff of four or five locals in the
                    political section, one of whom was the social secretary receptionist who didn't
                    really work for me but was nominally under the general affairs section. And then
                    I had three other locals, the senior one was very knowledgeable about politics,
                    the other two somewhat less so. But they all basically worked as translators,
                    doing translating of Chinese press on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the political section put out a press summary. But
                        nothere's the USIS office, aren't they also doing a Chinese press
                        summary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I honestly don't recall. But we would identify specific things that we
                    wanted translated, and that's how that worked. I would want to say this about
                    USIS. They were in a different location, in a different building, but
                    nonetheless, I thought we had an excellent relationship and I thought the AIT
                    relationship in general where we were all nominally separated from our various
                    agencies and working for AIT that it worked very well. I thought it was one of
                    the most cooperative organizations that I've ever worked for from all the
                    various aspects and all the people that were involved in various parent agencies
                    that they represented. Now it happened during much of the time that I was there,
                    that the number two man, or the information officer for USIS, and I forget what
                    its designation was called in AIT, it had a different name like general affairs
                    in political section, but the number two guy was a State Department officer Joe
                    Moyle. I don't know whether that improved things or not because we had good
                    relations with his bosses as well, Harry Britton... But it was in general a good
                    relationship. We had a good relationship with the military attach�s as well, who
                    were, in fact, retired U.S. military. The military was a little bit more
                    scrupulous about not rehiring.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things that happens when [one] converts from an embassy to AIT is,
                    there's a whole shuffle of facilities. We leave the old embassy building and now
                    AIT is in a new building. Have all those administrative logistic changes been
                    handled and you no longer have any particular problems... you have enough
                    chairs, there's enough... no more logistics problems?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think everything was working very smoothly at the time I moved in.
                    They were not the nicest offices I've every had but they were certainly
                    adequate. From an administrative point of view, we were working smoothly. It was
                    an adequately funded operation, and had a very high degree of operation.</p>
                <p>Q: As head of the general affairs section, what is your relationship with the
                    front office, Jim, Stan Brooks, are you dividing up contacts, how does that fall
                    out?</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: The way Jim Lilly and Stan Brooks operated, was kind of Jim Lilly was
                    sort of Mr. Outside, and Stan Brooks was Mr. Inside. Maybe that's the way an
                    embassy typically operates. Stan did less contact work than either myself or Jim
                    Lilly. But we all had our contacts and tried to pool information. Jim Lilly,
                    coming out of the NSC, had a good sense of how our reporting could have the most
                    impact in Washington and was very interested in timing of reporting, and when we
                    got our reports in and getting them in at the strategic moment when it would
                    have the most impact. Very often, he would instruct us along those lines, that
                    we wanted to do this at such and such a time so that it arrived in Washington
                    when they were contemplating this or contemplating that. And then there was also
                    a good deal of competition with Beijing, where when Beijing did a certain kind
                    of reporting we wanted to come in with the other side or the counter report, or
                    in some cases before they reported, and in some cases after their report, but we
                    were always watching their reporting as well. And again, Jim Lilly was always
                    very alert to that kind of nuance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been very instructive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>Q: You are head of the political section, this is a senior position within the
                    mission. Are you accompanying Jim on a lot of his calls, or is he doing a lot of
                    his own reporting?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I'm accompanying him on a lot of his calls ansubsequently writing the
                    report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get in on a meeting with CCK?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't recall. This is a historic figure, and I remember seeing CCK, so
                    maybe it was in a meeting. I remember a meeting between Jim Lilly and CCK, as I
                    recall it took place across the street from the presidential palaces or the
                    foreign ministry... I can't remember. But it wasn't held in the building, I
                    don't know if it had an AIT non-recognition aspect to it. But a lot of these
                    meetings would be held elsewhere. I don't think we would meet with CCK very
                    often. Somewhat more meetings were held with Chien Fu, Fred Chien who was then
                    foreign minister. A lot of it went through CCNAA. Raymond Hu was the head of
                    CCNAA during a large portion of that period, and then John Chang was number two
                    and he was a special figure and had special relations with the Kuomintang
                    leadership, including CCK, so they dealt a lot with him.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you at this time see circumstances in which Taiwan was trying to project
                    an image of a more official relationship than we were comfortable with?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, occasionally we would call them out. We'd have a visitor, let's say
                    an official U.S. government visitor and it would get into the press, and we'd
                    kind of call them on it and say if this leaks or gets undue publicity, we won't
                    be able to have these kinds of visits in the future and that would be very
                    unfortunate. And they'd say, oh, well, we don't know how this happened or why
                    this happened. But basically, it wasn't tremendous strains, they were always
                    trying to promote the look of official relations. But I don't think they were
                    obnoxious about it. Obviously, they had their interests and we had our interests
                    and we both understood where we were coming from, and they recognized that a
                    certain degree of cooperation was necessary if they wanted our cooperation.
                    Getting our noses too far out of joint would be against their interests.</p>
                <p>Q: The main political situation is that much of the opposition is in jail now
                    because of the Kaohsiung incident. There's a postponed election that takes place
                    maybe when you were still in the commercial area.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't remember any elections. [laughter] I mean elections were all that
                    critical at that point. I remember that I was dealing with one wives of the
                    imprisoned Kaosiung figures at that time. And Kang Ning Hsiang who subsequently
                    fades from the scene, I guess, although I remember reading his name in the...
                    The Chinese apparently refused to allow him to accompany whoever was leading the
                    Taiwan delegation to the mainland in a meeting a couple of years ago. But Kung
                    was someone I met pretty frequently with and got pretty close to. I liked him,
                    of course he was kind of a moderate figure, the kind that Americans tend to
                    like, and I guess wasn't enough of a firebrand for the subsequently evolution of
                    the opposition.</p>
                <p>Q: The Kaosiung incident itself raised a lot of thoughts of human rights and that
                    sort of stuff. Were you getting anybody interested in the human rights situation
                    in Taiwan or a lot of congressional inquiries?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, yes, there were congressional inquiries and there was always an
                    interest in the human rights situation. I wouldn't say that I was getting people
                    interested in it, because for us it was a problem. But one of the... this is a
                    slightly different aspect of things... in talking to... I remember John Chang in
                    particular, making this point to him... I was always kind of pushing the line
                    that their friends in Washington were the people who would be the most helpful
                    to them in Washington were not the traditional lobby. Jesse Helms or people on
                    the right in the American political spectrum, but it would be people like Steven
                    Solarz, for example, who were interested in democracy and human rights, and that
                    this was the line that they should be pushing and pursuing, that they are an
                    evolving democracy, that they're not some right wing retrograde government and
                    that this would be their natural line of support in the U.S. Congress. Again, I
                    think that's the way that things have evolved to a considerable extent although
                    they've maintained their support on the U.S. right as well. But they've managed
                    to add a number of people who recognized that as they've evolved into a more
                    democratic, I guess now you'd say fully democratic, government that they've
                    added this support of people who are supportive of democracies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I got out and visited various parts of the island, but again,
                    because of our unofficial relationship, you don't call on the county magistrate
                    and various governmental officials when you travel, but I managed to get out and
                    see people, both official and unofficial.</p>
                <p>Q: There's always the stereotype that foreign service only sees the upper level

                    you're not supposed to necessarily see the upper level people. Yet, how would
                    you describe your understanding of the environment in Taiwan at that time?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think it was reasonably good, but not as good as I would have liked it
                    to have been. But we got around and saw people. It was still an authoritarian
                    system where you couldn't necessarily talk freely with a wide range of people,
                    or people would not talk freely with you, to put it more accurately. People were
                    still cautious about contact with foreigners, at least most people were. It was
                    problematic. We had a good sense of what was going on, but not necessarily
                    firsthand. We spoke a lot to the press and to, there were some of these
                    magazines that were coming as part of the liberalization of Taiwan, the number
                    of magazines that were opposition inclined, or at least non-KMT, being an
                    important one. We would talk to those people regularly, publishers, editors,
                    reporters, and that gave us a somewhat broader insight into the society and what
                    was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: There's been some thought that evolved thoroughly and could be anticipated
                    that there would be a shift in recognition, that there was still was hard
                    feelings in some quarters of the Kuomintang officials. Did you get any sense of
                    that... were there people who didn't return your calls or you couldn't... were
                    you trying to keep up with the Kuomintang offices as well as the government
                    offices?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, we were trying to work with the Wo Man Dung and get insights from
                    them rather assiduously, in fact since we couldn't contact the government, I
                    think we focused on the Kuomintang somewhat more than we would have otherwise. I
                    don't remember anyone not returning any calls. I'm convinced there were hard
                    feelings on the part of some people, generally a mistrust of the Americans and
                    our goodwill and our faithfulness, but I don't remember anybody stiffing me or
                    being overtly rude. I'm sure there were people who were less cooperative than
                    they might otherwise have been.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: One of the big efforts they had going on at this point was the
                    congressional staff delegations that they were being invited over, ostensibly
                    under the guise of private missions. It was a non-governmental entity, that is a
                    non-Taiwan entity, that was sponsoring them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, there were a number of them. There was a series of them, but
                    obviously it was all government money that was in fact behind this. It was a
                    very well-funded, very well organized operation and sometimes they'd run them by
                    us, that is they'd inform us...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressional staffers...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Congressional staffers, they inform us that they had a group of four or
                    eight or however many were in the group, who were going to be visiting in Taiwan
                    and they wanted a briefing from the AIT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be the first time that you would know that
                        thespeople were coming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, that would usually be the case. We'd arrange a briefing, and spend
                    sometimes a couple of hours, sometimes a morning shooting the breeze. Sometimes
                    we wouldn't really have any contact with them at all. We'd know that some people
                    were in town, but we wouldn't be called upon to do anything. I suspect, I
                    believe, that it typically was at the request of the group whether we were
                    involved or not. That is, the Taiwan authorities didn't make any particular
                    point, or it was not routine to set up a meeting with us, but they were willing
                    to do so if the group requested it.</p>
                <p>

                <p>IFSHIN: My sense is that it was working very well, surprisingly. Yes, there were
                    bumps in the road, but nothing that we weren't able to work out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was not involved in that. There were a number of negotiations going on,
                    on a whole series of issues. My colleague, Clarke Ellis, who was the head of the
                    economics section, was deeply involved in those negotiations at that time, but I
                    never got involved in that.</p>
                <p>Q: So, you're building relationships with party people and dealing with
                    government people through the CCNAA thing. Any other particular incidents or
                    circumstances come to your attention that you...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't recall anything particularly exciting at that time.</p>
                <p>Q: We were talking about the Kaohsiung earlier, and you'd think that the
                    opposition had been rounded up, but my impression is that those that weren't and
                    the wives of those who were continued to be quite aggressive, and looking for
                    contact with the AIT.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the politically active members of the opposition were very open
                    about wanting to be in contact and criticizing the government and yes, that was
                    going on. I always had the idea that there were a lot of people who felt that
                    they were under the Kuomintang's radar who kept a low profile and were not
                    anxious to be... But, I had frequent contact with the opposition and they were
                    more than willing to meet with the Americans. They wanted to meet with the
                    Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: I would suppose they would have some fairly interesting insights on the local
                    political scene or why a certain set of appointments were materializing.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, of course they always had their take on all of thdevelopments, it
                    wasn't always a complete take or the most accurate one.</p>
                <p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>

                <p>Q: No, I'm thinking of another Sung who had a heart attack or stroke and that's
                    why Lee Teng Hui became the deputy. I can't think of the name.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Lee Teng Hui became...</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes. We did have an occasion to meet with him and I always found him
                    to be a fairly impressive figure. I did not anticipate his becoming president or
                    doing what in fact he did. In fact, I had identified some successive generation
                    which I thought would do some of the things that he perhaps did. I didn't
                    anticipate it happening as quickly as it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But even against the background of Kaosiung, you were

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I think we all saw an opening and saw that Kaosiung was a setback,
                    but a temporary setback to what was an ongoing process. Again, it all happened
                    so much faster than we anticipated, but we did see it happen. We did anticipate
                    it. It was the speed that was surprising.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, after Taipei, then you moved to the Philippines where you'd started out
                    twenty years earlier. Did you feel your career was going in circles?
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I'd always wanted to go to the Philippines, and was verpleased to get
                    the position in...</p>
                <p>Q: Now, it's open bidding, so you'd put in your bid for Cebu, you've written your
                    career development officer and said, 'I'm burning incense out here'...
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter] Yes, I'd been bidding on jobs in the Philippines ever since we
                    had open bidding, and ever since I'd entered the Foreign Service I'd always
                    wanted to serve in the Philippines. While I don't know whether Cebu was
                    necessarily always my first choice, it was certainly high on my screen at that
                    point and I was very pleased to get that job. Now my wife felt very isolated. I
                    think were the only foreign diplomatic mission in Cebu, or we were then, at
                    least, the post has long since been closed now. There were about five or six
                    honorary consuls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the diplomatic community in Cebu. Now just

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Cebu is on the island of Cebu. It's smack dab in the middle of the
                    Philippines, I'm going to point to it on the map that you have, although it
                    won't show up on your audio tape [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: West of Leyte. That's Negros there, and that's Panay off further to the
                    west. And Cebu in the middle. That's Leyte Samar to the east there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, why is there an American consulate in Cebu?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Cebu is the very center of the Philippines and is the big shipping center
                    and all the shipping lines tended to be out of Cebu to Luzan to the north and
                    Mindanau to the south, and Negros and Panay in the west, and Leyte Samar in the
                    east.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that's internal shipping.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, I'm talking about internal. It's kind of a transportation hub for
                    the Archipelago. And in fact, Tagalog has become the national language of the
                    Philippines because it's the language of the people around Manila and central
                    Luzon. But Cebuano probably has more native speakers than any other language
                    group in the Philippines. In fact the languages that are spoken on many of the
                    other Visayan islands, the islands in the center, are supposedly dialects of
                    Cebuano and may not be separate languages. The linguists would have to figure
                    that out. I'm not in a position to establish that out. In any case, Cebuano is
                    quite important in the Philippines and in fact, Cebuano settled much of
                    Mindanau, much of the Christian population of Mindanau is Cebuano. So the
                    Cebuanos are an important part of the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, is there a fair amount of American expatriate
                        presence ithat part of the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Traditionally, there has always been an American presence, although, no
                    we didn't have the military bases that they have on Luzon, the Clark and the
                    Subic, so we didn't have that kind of extensive presence. The second president
                    of the Philippines, Sergio Osmena, many of his descendants were dual nationals,
                    or had American nationality, including the person who was the governor of Cebu
                    during much of the time I was there, Emelito Osmena, was a grandson - his mother
                    was an American citizen, so he was an American citizen by birth. But at various
                    times he renounced his American citizenship and did other things for political
                    purposes as he was ascending the political ladder in the Philippines. But
                    throughout the Philippines there is an important American connection. Being the
                    U.S. consul in Cebu, as minor as the job is in terms of American bureaucracy, in
                    the Philippines, or at least in that part of the Philippines, it's a big deal. I
                    remember when we returned to the U.S., my then five year old daughter was
                    quizzing me on how come I'm never on television any more? [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] IFSHIN: We used to be regularly on television
                        in Cebu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's follow that up a little bit. Why would you be
                        otelevision in Cebu? Moving around the island.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Typically there would be a news coverage of some sort where they're doing
                    a report and they'd ask for a comment from the American consul, or they're
                    covering the opening of something and among the people in the crowd or the
                    honored guests is the American consul, this that or the other thing. I wouldn't
                    say I was on television all that often, but enough to impress my five year old
                    daughter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was then the main focus of that mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: From the U.S. government's point of view, it was political reporting. It
                    was a listening post for the southern Philippines, we had a consular
                    responsibility for the Visayas and Mindanau, where the embassy was responsible
                    for Luzon. But it was basically a political listening post.</p>
                <p>Q: Does this mean that you are meeting people who are later who are later going
                    to be important personalities in Manila, or political trends that start in that
                    part of the country that are going to spread...?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, I think it was just simply what's going on in that part of the
                    Philippines. It's a significant, I think half the population lives in the
                    Visayas and Mindanau, and as in so many countries, politics tends to be what
                    happens in the capital city. There are things that are happening outside of the
                    capital and what's happening is not unimportant, and I was able to get into the
                    grass roots and hear them there and listen to them. This is a country where, its
                    not a democracy, it's more of an oligarchy than anything else. It's not a
                    democracy in American terms, but it has democratic trappings and what happens
                    outside of the metropole outside of Manila, is important, does count in shaping
                    developments and shaping trends in the country. I was there when Aquino was
                    assassinated, and of course there was a strong reaction throughout the country,
                    including in Cebu and there were demonstrations and a growing movement against
                    President Marcos. I was reporting on that and how people were reacting
                    throughout the country. And Imelda Marcos was from Samar Leyte, which was part
                    of the consular district as well. In fact, what year would it have been... I was
                    there from '83 to '85, in any case it was the off year... the 39th anniversary
                    of the Leyte landing, I ended up being the senior American representative at the
                    anniversary celebrations, which was interesting of course because of course the
                    Japanese sent a big delegation there... [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: And President Marcos was there and Madam Imelda, and as I say I was there
                    as the senior American. The following year, which was a ten year anniversary
                    celebration, there was a much larger American delegation, and I was a relatively
                    junior member of the American group.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did your consular district also include the south, the
                        Musliarea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, in fact that was from my point of view an interesting aspect but
                    unfortunate aspect of my whole experience there. Two persons were “kidnaped”
                    during the time I was in Cebu, and it turned out that one of them was a dual
                    German-American national. The German embassy paid a quick visit, found out there
                    was nothing they could do and left. But the American embassy sent the intrepid
                    consul from Cebu down, and I ended up spending months, literally months, in the
                    area, doing very little on the ground so I could report back to the embassy as
                    to the lack of progress during this period.</p>
                <p>Q: And who were you talking to?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was talking to the Philippine military and the Philippines
                    constabulary, and occasionally to political leaders, including Muslim leaders in
                    the area about what was happening and the various ransom demands which everyone
                    was of course saying we are not going to meet. And this was dragged on and on.
                    Fortunately when I first arrived, I went to Jolo, an island off of Mindanau,
                    which is the capital of a Muslim area and the military command center there, and
                    I was supposed to use Philippines military channels to patch back in to the
                    embassy and I say fortunately they were unable to do it and our communications
                    failed. So I went back to Zamboanga, which is a moderately nice city on the
                    southern coast there, and was able to establish communications with the embassy.
                    So I made Zamboanga my headquarters, which was a hell of a much nicer place to
                    be than Jolo for the next few months as I fulfilled this function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is not continuous for the next few months, this

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, it was largely continuous for months and going back foa day or
                    two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was ridiculous, it went on much too long, a big waste otime.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this a decision on your part, that your personal

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, it was a decision on the part of the embassy that they wanted me
                    there. Maybe toward the end it got kind of, “Oh, is he still there? Maybe we
                    ought to let him leave.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were you reporting to then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The DCM, Bob Rich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were pretty much in constant contact. Oh occasionally I would call the
                    political consular, Scott Halperin, but mostly it was Bob. One thing that
                    happened, I was feeling very isolated and upset and lonely there, and my wife
                    got in touch with some of our friends in Cebu and said that they should have
                    their relatives take care of me, so after that I had my [caretakers] down there.
                    [laughter] I had a whole bunch of people who sort of adopted me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But if the embassy is putting you up in a hotel or a guest
                        house,that's costing money in addition to your time and talent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was so attractive about these two kidnapees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, it was a somewhat new situation at that time. Now, subsequently, I
                    see people get kidnaped all the time, but at that time it was a relatively new
                    phenomenon, especially for the Philippines it was a relatively new phenomenon.
                    They were “hostages.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is not that far after Tehran, so probably
                        Americanare very sensitive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, there were all kinds of sensitivities involved. But even whether
                    they were really hostages was a question mark, you know, exactly how they had
                    been taken and whether they had more or less walked into this knowingly. It was
                    a bad situation that went on for much too long, and unfortunately my role in it
                    was an unwilling and unhappy one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how many consulates are there in the Philippines at
                        this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Just Cebu, there's Manila and Cebu</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that's a small consulate, it's just you and one
                        other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: At that time, one other officer. During the time that I was there we
                    moved our facilities. Our plan was to add another officer who would bring with
                    him secure communications and a secretary, an American secretary. Obviously not
                    a State Department secretary. But that happened subsequent to my departure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that means that when you wanted to send classified
                        informatioto the embassy, how are you... are you having to pouch it up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, we had a one-time pad, which we never used during the time I was
                    there. Basically I sent unclassified messages. Nothing much has to be classified
                    if you don't want to classify it. You know, we would forward it as an OI, and
                    they would put it in classified form and pass it on to Washington if they wanted
                    to.</p>
                <p>Q: So you have your long-going kidnaping saga going on. That really does cut into
                    reporting on what the politics are or the impact of Aquino's assassination.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. I don't remember exactly when I got involved in thabut it went on
                    for a long, long time. Literally for months.</p>
                <p>Q: Saigon fell ten years earlier, but at one point there was a fairly large boat
                    people presence in the Philippines. Was any of that in your consulate
                    district?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't think so. I was not involved in that. Q: In Cebu then, you are
                    running your own mission, looks good, you go back to the bid list for 1985 and
                    you are looking for a job in Washington, or did you specifically go for the
                    human rights bureau?</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I was very interested in the human rights bureau and bid for the human
                    rights bureau at that time. Again, I don't recall how high it was on my list,
                    but I understand that he's a very controversial figure and there are many people
                    who have a very different appreciation than I do, but I was a big admirer of
                    Elliot Abrams. I personally appreciated the way we had, under the Reagan
                    administration, incorporated human rights into American foreign policy, so that
                    the human rights bureau was no longer an enemy of the geographic bureaus, but
                    somewhat tolerated, if not a particularly loved, part of the whole operation.
                    Since I personally believe that human rights have to be part of American foreign
                    policy and should be an important part of American foreign policy, incorporating
                    it into that policy in a useful way, rather than in an antagonistic way, struck
                    me as a worthwhile thing to be doing. When I came back to Washington, Elliot
                    Abrams had already left the human rights bureau. And when I repeated this story
                    to other people, they told me 'oh well, if he had known you were coming, he
                    would gladly have stayed.' But he went on to ARA by that time, and Richard
                    Shifter replaced him as the assistant secretary. I think we arrived more or less
                    at the same time. I don't know how I would have worked with Elliot Abrams, but
                    Richard Shifter was someone I admire and respect on a policy point of view and
                    found extremely difficult person to work for. I understand his way of operating
                    is very much the way a partner treats associates in a law firm, that is, he
                    tells associates to “do this” and they are supposed to go out and service him in
                    various ways. But it was a very un-State Department-ish way of operating, and
                    very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you are coming back to be the acting director of the
                        officof multilateral affairs. What does that cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It covered among other things, UN agencies including the UN Commission on
                    Human Rights. The bureau, the HA at that time, now the DRL? But in those days it
                    was HA, Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. It used to include refugee
                    affairs, and then refugees were spun out into their own bureau, but the bureau
                    also maintained liaisons with International Committee of the Red Cross. UN
                    agencies, all sort of other local international human rights bureaus, like the
                    Interamerican Commission for Human Rights, and the International Committee of
                    the Red Cross. These were the sorts of things that we followed, the multilateral
                    affairs. The bureau at that time only had three offices as I recall. There was
                    Bilateral Affairs, Multilateral Affairs, and Plans and Programs. So it was a
                    very small office and a very small bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that means multilateral affairs and you are doing a lot
                        oliaison with the bureau of international organizations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. It proved to be an extremely awkward relationship. Not to say a
                    downright unpleasant and awful relationship. For one thing, Richard Shifter had
                    been a representative to the human rights commission and subsequently had served
                    in the U.S. mission in New York as ambassador to the security council. So he was
                    particularly interested in UN agencies and our relationship to them. At the same
                    time, the various political appointees in IO bureau were determined to keep our
                    nose out of it to the extent possible. In general, this made our life very
                    difficult, very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you'd want to talk to UNHCR, and IO would say, no we
                        don'clear cable... or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely. Every cable had to originate with them, anythinto...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A UN agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Or to Geneva. I mean we weren't sending cables directly to UN agencies.
                    Anything to Geneva or New York had to originate with them, and had to show them
                    as the drafting office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hm, that is pretty strict.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, these things evolved over time. But that was one of those things. I
                    have very little pride of authorship and I agreed that anything I wrote they
                    could show whoever they wanted as the drafter, as far as I was concerned.
                    Nonetheless, it was awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the front office of IO at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Allen Keyes was the assistant secretary at that time, but the problem
                    wasn't so much with Keyes as with one of the deputy assistant secretaries, whose
                    name currently escapes me... a woman, a political appointee. It just got really
                    awful. The head of the Human Rights Office in IO, a very, very nice man - Warren
                    Hewitt - who was a very senior career State Department civilian, not foreign
                    service, found it so awkward that he eventually he had to leave. He left that
                    office and joined HA as a senior advisor or some such thing just to give him a
                    title and a job. But it was just an awful, awkward relationship where we were
                    constantly butting heads and constantly at each other's throats. This shouldn't
                    happen.</p>
                <p>Q: You are saying this is a political appointee who is guarding the gate and this
                    is the Reagan administration. Are these two things significant or is it just
                    this individual's personality?</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think it was personality more than anything else. Richard Shifter has
                    subsequently endorsed Clinton and stayed on through the Clinton administration
                    and was with the State Department, I guess he's gone now, but he was with the
                    State Department for many years and he was a political appointee too. But he was
                    essentially a conservative and someone who... I remember so many times when I'd
                    participate in meetings between these two individuals and they would debate how
                    to be more effective, and how would an embassy read a certain cable and how
                    would our embassies react, how are foreign governments reacting... and it struck
                    me that this wasn't what the debate was about. I mean they would argue along
                    those terms because this is a way of winning their argument, but all they were
                    arguing about was which one of them was going to make the decision and be on
                    top. That's what it all was about. It was all power struggle. It wasn't policy.
                    Nonetheless we got some things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Our great accomplishment during the time I was there, I was a member of
                    one of the delegations to the human rights session six weeks in Geneva. By the
                    way, it was very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not like six weeks in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: But we made our priority the passage of a convention on religion
                    establishing a covenant religious freedom. We managed to get that passed.</p>
                <p>Q: Did that take a fair amount of lobbying of other national delegations? Now
                    that would all be done within the context of this one conference... you hadn't
                    primed other delegations?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, we'd been in touch, and in particular with our European allies.
                    When I say European allies, I mean the WEOG group in the UN context, the western
                    European and others. The human rights commission has a membership of about 55
                    countries or something like that, maybe less, but we'd been touch with a number
                    of capitals and had primed them. It was a lot of intensive lobbying and drafting
                    and redrafting during the session. A lot goes on right during the meeting. It's
                    an evolving process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An how are the dynamics of the meeting going? I mean
                        you're not head of the delegation, you are supporting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The delegations are talking...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: It depends on the country involved. In some cases we are talking to our
                    counterpart, but other delegations are quite small and we are talking to the
                    senior members of their delegation. The representative of whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a fair example of international negotiating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it was an interesting experience. It's my one international
                    conference that I can recall during my career. It's quite an interesting process
                    and I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any time to stick your head outside and
                        see...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, the other thing about these meetings is that nothing goes on
                    during the weekends. So you work hard during the week and then you have your
                    weekend off. I was there with the other two relatively junior members of the
                    delegation. We'd rent a car and drive into France and Switzerland. They went to
                    Italy, I did not, during that period... I forget why. We had a ball, really.
                    That was nice experience, especially getting it paid for. Actually the head of
                    the U.S. delegation, the U.S. representative, was a guy named Wallach, also a
                    political appointee. The head of the U.S. delegation is almost always a
                    political appointee, although secretary Shifter flew out to participate for a
                    while. The DAS's name is escaping me, I'm sure I blotted it out. [laughter]
                    Shifter flew out and participated for a while, long enough to get into a fight
                    with me. But the head of our delegation subsequently had some sort of a scandal,
                    the details of which elude me at the moment, but ended up in prison for a while.
                    But that's another story [laughter]. These were all very high quality
                    individuals. [laughter]</p>
                <p>Q: [laughter] So, back in Washington, the tension between the two bureaus impacts
                    on what you can accomplish. Are you also going to the regional bureaus from time
                    to time, do you get to talk to the UK?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, right, in the human rights commission context, you always have these
                    national resolutions. In those days, there was always a resolution on El
                    Salvador, on Chile, a lot of it was with ARA. We worked a lot with desks in
                    other bureaus. In fact, in a lot of our friction with IO, the geographic bureau
                    would be our ally, typically we'd be allied with the geographic bureau and
                    against IO, well, not against IO, but IO always had a different strategy in
                    mind. They wanted to take the lead or they wanted to do something, and we'd be
                    working with the geographic bureau and we'd be working on a strategy that they
                    felt left out on.</p>
                <p>Q: Multilateral affairs covers all these UN organizations, but the basic thrust
                    of what HA bureau is supposed to do at this time, could you describe that a
                    little bit? That's at the start of the Reagan administration, right?</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I recall, there were the three offices within the HA bureau then.
                    There was the Bilateral Affairs. That covered the world, and you had bilateral
                    offices, each of whom had essentially one of the geographic bureaus. There was
                    an officer doing Latin America. That job eventually got so big that it got
                    divided up between two officers. There was somebody doing eastern Europe and the
                    Soviet Union, and there was an officer doing western Europe, and one who did
                    Africa, and one who did the Middle East. I guess there was an EAP officer as
                    well, yes, of course, I remember very well now. They covered human rights
                    developments in each of those countries and what was going on. Excuse me I just
                    thought of the fourth office within the bureau.Anyway, that was BA. And then you
                    had Plans and Programs, and although MA subsequently merged with Plans and
                    Programs and I became the deputy in the office and I should have a better idea
                    of what they were doing, I don't really remember what all those plans and
                    programs were except that we were responsible for the human rights report. But
                    at that time, basically it was done with contractors, retired foreign service
                    officers, who worked pretty much on their own under the supervision of the
                    director of the office who was Ward Thompson at that time. Ward and I by the way
                    go way back to A100, we were in the same A100 class.</p>
                <p>The other office that I'd forgotten was also employing retired foreign service
                    officers, and that was the office of Asylum Affairs, and that still exists, and
                    in fact the human rights reports is now prepared by the office of Asylum
                    Affairs. It's... what's the name of the office now? I worked for it so I should
                    know. Human Rights and Asylum Affairs, I guess that's the name of the office.
                    Anyway, it does the human rights report and whenever there were requests for
                    political asylum in this country, those determinations are made by INS, but INS
                    always gets an advisory opinion from the State Department and the advisory is
                    prepared in the office of Asylum Affairs by an asylum officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that opinion would focus on the grounds for asylum for
                        thaparticular country or that particular condition...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely, the human rights condition in that country, anthe likelihood
                    of this individual's claims being accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because asylum follows a particular set of criteria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well-founded fear of persecution. IFSHIN: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As acting director of multilateral affairs and then within
                        somtimeframe those two offices were joined.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. They were both very small offices, so the idea thainstead of two
                    small offices, we'd have one small office. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: One moderate size office.</p>
                <p>Q: But the whole idea of having a bureau of human rights, the information has
                    always been out there, we've always known these circumstances go on, but this is
                    a way of concentrating the information and giving a much higher profile to the
                    whole process.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We also developed a lot more information by having an office that was
                    interested in it, somebody to report to who was really was following these
                    issues, and suddenly there was a lot more information that was available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The joining of these two offices, this was just an
                        administrativdecision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. Again, a lot of HA is fairly ad hoc, at least in those days. They
                    kept adding supernumeraries, and people who were outside of the office structure
                    who were, especially under Shifter, who had this kind legal partnership kind of
                    mentality, where he was the partner and everybody else was associates. I think
                    he would have been happy to have no offices but have 30 officers working for
                    him. But the department insisted on having some offices. They kept adding people
                    who were given special functions of one sort of another, but I can't even
                    remember what all of those were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a special reporter for the Middle East, or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, no, it tended to be somebody was usually given a functional title
                    of some sort... public affairs, legislative affairs. Things that existed in
                    other bureaus as well, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But their function was related to something entirely
                        different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: And these were usually C Schedule people, politicaappointees.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Q: So was that responding to a need that the bureau had for work? If they were
                    political appointees, the department is told 'you have to take 20 guys' and the
                    department tries to figure out where to stick 20 guys where they won't do too
                    much damage?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think it was a combination. Sometimes there was a need, and sometimes
                    there an individual available who they felt, 'he might be useful... we'll think
                    of what he can do after we get him on board'.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He might be useful but we don't want him too close to
                        thcontrols?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, some of them were actually... they tended to be young people. Most of
                    them were fairly able. But they were brought aboard in kind of a strange way
                    that was never clear to me but didn't have much to do in my area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they weren't career foreign service people, staring
                        off...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No.</p>
                <p>Q: They were career civilians getting a crack of the taste of what the foreign
                    service or State Department was doing in some particular are that was of
                    interest to them and this looks good on their resume.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, that happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, and as I say, some of them proved to be pretty good.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, these two offices that come together to become the office of Plans,
                    Programs and Multilateral Affairs, I gather you're saying there's not much
                    difference in the workload.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It didn't really change much at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fight with IO is the same, and the issues are the
                        same.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, my issues remained exactly the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your issues were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Depending on the season, a continuing HA relationship witthe human rights
                    commission...</p>
                <p>Q: Now, depending on the season means that these international conferences meet
                    at certain times of the year, and your focus is that's your deadline, if you
                    will, to have your positions and your contacts in place, and to go to that
                    meeting. Then once that meeting is over, there is either another meeting in
                    front of you or you are prepping for the next go-around.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. There's always something coming up, something on thagenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the Europeans had CSCE, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, that was a going part of our portfolio, although it tended to be
                    handled by... That was somewhat more concentrated in the BA office. But you're
                    right, we were involved in that as well. That was a big deal I think. And in
                    fact, in the history of the Cold War, I think the so called third basket, the
                    Human Rights Basket. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>I could tell you the old joke... I grew up in New York of course and thought I
                    loved Chinese food, but all I knew was the ersatz semi-Cantonese New York type
                    restaurant of that era which was ersatz Cantonese. And that leads to the old
                    joke about the guy who goes into the Chinese restaurant, there's lots of Chinese
                    restaurant jokes, but the one I'm thinking of this guy goes into the restaurant
                    and he's looking at the menu and he sees pizza. He calls over the waiter and
                    say, “what's this, pizza on the menu of a Chinese restaurant?” The waiter says,
                    “oh, we have a large Jewish clientele.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: But the first time I went to Taiwan, which was as a Peace Corps
                    volunteer, and they took us to the Szechwan restaurant, which was still in
                    existence when last I was in Taiwan, Mount Mouchan was it? One of the sacred
                    mountains. I'm sitting there and sweating and a Chinese gentleman had ordered
                    for us, a group of Peace Corps volunteers, and I said, “This is Chinese food,
                    this is great, I've never had anything like this before in my life.” That was
                    it, I was converted then and there.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Q: But that's just the interesting part of how we all came from these middle
                    class backgrounds all over the country and yet for some reason were willing to
                    be more experimental. I think the American overseas has always felt himself
                    superior to the Brit, for example, the Brit trying to replicate the home, and
                    the American trying to be more experimental and seeing what the local guys are
                    eating...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Get down and dirty, yes. Of course, both the foreigservice and the Peace

                <p>IFSHIN: Right, there were limited horizons in Great Britain at thtime, so more

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: It is the fifth of July. We had a very rainy fourth. We're back, talking with
                    Stan Ifshin, and we've got a couple of more things... We wanted to pick up from
                    the previous tapes. The material on the Vocal CORDS. Why don't we get into that?
                    Oh, I see you've brought copies. Oh, yes, I see what you're saying, that this is
                    old paper.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. This is original Xeroxes. It's like, if there is such a thing,
                    it's an oxymoron, it's an original Xerox. But in 1967-68 when we were in the
                    Vietnam training center, we compiled these songbooks, and in the second set of
                    lyrics which I have with me here, were done about a year later or at the
                    anniversary of our first year in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now remind us who was involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the Vocal CORDS, this was the fourth or the twelfth, I can't
                    remember exactly what number of persons being cycled through the Vietnam
                    training center. We were there doing the full year. The core group was made up
                    of the 79th A100 class, or as we used to refer to it, as the Fighting 79th.
                    Myself, and Michael Carpenter were the chief lyricists, and Tim Hamilton and Don
                    Sutter, who were also from the 79th A100 class were also members of the original
                    Vocal CORDS, I don't know if there were any successors. And Joe Romanelli who
                    was in our Vietnam training center class was also a member of the group. Mike
                    and I did most of the lyrics and we were both sort of interested in and familiar
                    with music from the '20s and '30s and '40s. I'm not sure when all these songs
                    have their origins. And we wrote, I guess it's about 40 or 50 songs during our
                    time in, well, maybe it's less than that, and then we did another 15 to 20 songs
                    for our anniversary.</p>
                <p>I don't know how many of these you want to go through, but I'm looking at our
                    first volume, the Vocal CORDS Songbook, which was subtitled “Songs to Alienate
                    Hearts and Minds By” and it had a dedication: “Our sincere thanks to the many
                    training institutions which took so generously of our time and gave us the
                    inspiration for many of these songs. Resemblance to any war, living or dead, is
                    purely coincidental. The Vocal CORDS.”</p>
                <p>The lead song, the first song, I don't know if they were written in this order,
                    but the first one that we gave pride of place to was called, “Whoops” and it was
                    sung to the tune of “Making Whoopie.” I don't know whether to recite it or sing
                    it, but I'll try and sing it. [sings]</p>

                <p>Q: [laughter] Now as I've said, I first heard this stuff when John Lyle and some
                    of the guys came over to Bangkok for their R and R.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Mhm. I've known John over the years, but I didn't even know he was
                    familiar with these songs, quite frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was somebody else...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, Tim and Mike both ended up in Bangkok, but that waafter
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was after. But these would be guys coming from R and
                        trying to decompress. There were three or four others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't know if you want to keep going, but they're in order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do one more, and maybe we can type the others in

                <p>IFSHIN: Okay. Then we had “CORDS, CORDS, CORDSmen,” sung to thtune of “Toot,
                    Toot, Tootsie.” [sings]</p>

                <p>That's as we say, just to give you a flavor of some of the others, “Talk of the

                    tune of “Once Upon a Time.” “Your Assistant District Rep Wears Army Boots” to
                    the tune of “Whispering.” “A Package Deal” to the tune of “I'm Sending You a

                <p>Next song was “Head for your Bunker, Ellsworth,” sung to the tune of “Give My

                    Go.” “That Tet Offensive,” to the tune of “If You Knew Susie.” “The Vocal CORDS

                    tune of “Put on Your Old Gray Bonnet.” “Set 'em up Ho” to the tune of “One More
                    for the Road.” “Con Om Tee Sow” to the tune of “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” and I
                    don't remember my Vietnamese enough to know what that means. “One More Round” to
                    the tune of “I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover.” “Westie's Way,” of course,
                    sung to the tune of “Yesterday.”</p>

                <p>We were sure they had had their fill</p>
                <p>And I believe in Westie's Way</p>
                <p>Why we had to go, we didn't know, Dean didn't say</p>
                <p>We've done something wrong, but no that's Westie's Waaaaaay</p>
                <p>Up in Hue, everything was going swell</p>
                <p>Now they've bombed away the citadel</p>

                <p>Embassy, it was almost home to me</p>
                <p>Now the Vietcong are having tea</p>

                <p>But I believed in Westie's Way</p>
                <p>“Chow Tung” to the tune of “You Could Be Swinging on a Star.” By the way, I
                    should remind you that these songs were mostly, well, these songs were all
                    written before we went to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so at this point when was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, Westie's Way was obviously after the Tet Offensive, and that would
                    have been February, March of '68. And we went in August of '68, that's when we
                    actually arrived 'in country' so to speak in that famous race. And then we had
                    “In the Hot, Muggy Swamps of Vietnam” to the tune of “In the Cool, Cool, Cool of
                    the Evening.”</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: All before we got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, were you talking to people coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes. We were constantly going through training, and we were
                    constantly having lectures from people who had been in Vietnam, and as I said
                    our dedication was to the training institutions which had taken so generously of
                    our time. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We were then at VTC, we had also gone through a short AID orientation
                    course training, and before that, we had of course come out of A100, so we had
                    been doing nothing but training for a fairly solid block of time at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>The next tune was called, “Tuy, Tuy, Tuy” and I don't really remember exactly
                    what that means again, but it's to the tune of, the first Tuy I believe was “I,”
                    so it's to the tune of “I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter.”
                    Then we had “A Strange and Wonderful Experience” to the tune of “Twelve Days of
                    Christmas.” And finally, the next one is in really bad condition, I can't even
                    read it, but it's to the tune of “Tip Toe Through the Tulips,” I can't make out
                    what...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nice coffee stain there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, well, it's some kind of stain... I hope it's coffee. The next
                    songbook as I said was written for our first year anniversary. We had a little
                    reunion, and I don't think all that many people made it, but those who did, we
                    had a songbook for them. The dedication was, “Our sincere thanks to the war, our
                    only source of inspiration.” And it was called “The Vocal CORDS Go Vietnamese.
                    More Songs to Alienate Hearts and Minds.” The first song was, “No Forn” to the
                    tune of “Shine on Harvest Moon.” The next tune was “We Who HESitate Salute You.”
                    HES was the Hamlet Evaluation System. Sung to the tune of “Daisy.” “A Bained
                    Expression” to the tune of “I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire.” Chet Baines
                    was one of our trainers and I don't really remember why we made him the source
                    of inspiration there. “Tai See Du Doma,” again that was a Vietnamese expression
                    that escapes me, but it was to the tune of “Zippity Doo Dah.” “A S Alphabet
                    Soup” to the tune of “Mares Eat Oats.”Q: So this represents nine...</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Less inspired, frankly. We were unable to collaborate because we were
                    scattered around the country. If I recall correctly, these were Mike Carpenter
                    products. Mike was in Saigon. I got to Saigon occasionally. “Making Friends the
                    MacBeasy Way” to the tune of “If I Could Be with You.” “Oh, You CO lossal Co” to
                    the tune of “Oh, You Beautiful Doll.” “Know Thyself” to the tune of
                    “K-K-K-Katie.” “No Regrets Only” to the tune of “Yes, We Have No Bananas.”
                    “Never Again” to the tune of “You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby.” “Run, Don't
                    Walk” to the tune of “With a Song in My Heart.” That was it. Anyway it occupied
                    some time.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it was an interesting intellectual adventure in that you understood what
                    you were involved in and where you were going and a little bit afterwards. As I
                    was saying, when we were in Beijing after Tiananmen Square somebody did the same
                    thing, took some songs, put some new lyrics to them. It was a matter of how you
                    handled the frustration, because we'd evacuated the embassy, there were no
                    dependents, we'd pulled 1,400 Americans, students and businessmen and there was
                    nobody but us for about two or three months. And this process boiled up these
                    songs. “P L A” to “Surfing USA” was interesting.</p>
                <p>But we were going to pick up a few other things.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, I'm sure we were, but I don't remember. It's been quite a break
                    between this, not that it's your fault, I'm the one who became scarce.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, let's move on with our schedule. You were just finishing up '85-'87
                    human rights and humanitarian affairs bureau and all its reorganizations and you
                    were in this office and then you were in that office. I assume we covered all
                    this, unless you want to give a five-sentence summary of what were the most
                    important pressures or programs that you thought you saw in that two-year
                    period.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, as I said in our earlier tape, Ambassador Shifter was very
                    interested in UN affairs and had come out of that as his background. He had been
                    the U.S. representative to the Human Rights Commission. Since I was working in
                    the same area, he was very interested in that and we got to go to one of the
                    Commission session. Again that was a very interesting experience. It all just
                    sort of came rushing back when the U.S. was in this most recent election of
                    membership to the Human Rights Commission, the U.S. for the first time was
                    denied membership and is not going to be in the very next session. Will not be a
                    member of the Human Rights Commission and I think this is a very unfortunate,
                    although of course we'll be able to lobby and I'm sure we'll speak as
                    non-members. I'm not sure how restricted we will be in terms of our
                    participation. It's unfortunate. Anyway, I think I covered what the strains were
                    that went on between what was then HA and is now DRL and the IO bureau as we
                    wrestled over various parts of the agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Subsequent to that then, you moved back to the
                        regionabureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, I went to EAP, in Pacific Island Affairs which was a small office,
                    dealing with most but not all of the Pacific islands. At that time there was a
                    separate country directorate for the freely associated states, which I think
                    basically was an outgrowth of the fact that the negotiations that had gone on so
                    long between those states and the United States to work out arrangement for
                    dissolving the trust arrangements. But I was working on the other Pacific island
                    countries and territories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us examples of these two categories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Basically, they had the federated states of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,
                    and a third, I can't member... The Northern Marianas which continued their
                    association with the United States. I'm not sure, but we had the rest of the
                    Pacific, which was most of it. I was the deputy director of the office, but also
                    was the country officer for the Micronesia states which are Papua New Guinea,
                    the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, Vanuatu being the former New Hebrides, or as
                    we called it, “the Pacific Pandemonium.” It was the Pacific Condominium, when
                    Britain and France had joint sovereignty over the New Hebrides which led to a
                    great deal of confusion. But we also then had all the Polynesian countries,
                    Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and Fiji is sort of mixed Micronesian and Polynesian, and
                    Tuvalu and Kiribati.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: None of which were UN trusteeship territories after the
                        end othe war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No.</p>
                <p>Q: So this differentiation between these two offices represent these trusteeship
                    territories that had moved on to independence and then sort of others?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The freely associated states had been U.S. trust territories. The
                    countries that we had responsibility for had a variety of backgrounds. Some of
                    them had been Australian trust territories after World War I. Papua New Guinea,
                    for example. But after World War II... I don't actually know what all the
                    colonial arrangements had been. The British had control over the Solomon
                    Islands. I'm trying to remember what the background was, if the UN had the role
                    or not. But in any case these countries had all become independent and were no
                    longer under any colonial background and these were the ones we were responsible
                    for. Subsequently, these two offices were combined, which made perfectly good
                    sense, and they were then rolled into Australia and New Zealand. Which again
                    made very good sense because Australia and New Zealand were terribly interested
                    in these countries and terribly interested in our policy toward these countries.
                    In addition, there are various regional bodies which we are members of and which
                    the Australians and New Zealanders are also members of and play important
                    roles.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why I was asking, because it seems to me that State
                        Department organization probably followed some sort of policy
                        differentiation and as that differentiation fell off then these offices
                        would be combined. I'm trying to get... you know, the State Department
                        doesn't go around building offices for nothing. This represents some policy
                        difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, I think it was basically for nothing, but I think a lot of it had
                    to do with, well, there may, in fact, have been a congressional requirement. I'm
                    not sure. But the freely associated states, while we were negotiating, that was
                    a big deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, there was a special negotiator for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, there was a special negotiator, and of course interior department
                    had played a big role in all of this. I think there might have been a
                    requirement, in fact I know there was some sort of legal requirement for a
                    separate office for the freely associated states. Obviously those of us who were
                    working on Pacific Island Affairs and freely associated states, although most of
                    the people in freely associate states had come out of interior and were not
                    State Department, or did not have a long history with State Department. We all
                    recognized that this should be one office, and it didn't make a whole lot of
                    sense as the arrangements with the freely associated states were worked out, it
                    didn't make a lot of sense for there to be two offices. But there were legal
                    reasons why there were two offices and it took a while for it to be worked out
                    and it was worked out after my time, but the two offices were merged.</p>

                    give you an exact date. It all did happen and it all makes very good sense from
                    my point of view and I believe that it has all worked out fairly well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So sitting in PIA, what are your main pressures and what
                        are youmain problems that you are working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The main problem we have is that we are such a small office, and from the
                    State Department's point of view, a not terribly consequential area who is
                    getting attention. In fact, in some ways that was nice. We kind of made policy
                    in a way that if you are a desk officer working on China you don't get to make
                    policy, I don't think, because the amount of interest that is being shown in
                    China by all sorts of people. But in Pacific Island Affairs, for the most part,
                    unless there's a problem, no one's paying a whole lot of attention to what
                    you're doing. We used to feel that basically that it was us and then it was
                    George Schultz because George Schultz had been a marine in the Pacific in World
                    War II and had some interest in the islands, actually. But up until that level,
                    I don't think there were a whole lot of people who were interested in the
                    Pacific Islands. But whenever we needed to get into see him or needed a decision
                    we found that we had a friend in the office of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the policy areas then that you dealt
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There's a tuna treaty where we provide them, and then it was $10 million,
                    chump change from the point of view of the State Department or the United
                    States, but we provided the countries of the Pacific with $10 million for the
                    rights to U.S. tuna boats to fish in their waters. It was always a big deal
                    getting the appropriation out of Congress and keeping it going, but it was done.
                    Nuclear issues were important. The transportation of nuclear waste and nuclear
                    fuels basically between Japan and the United States. Plus of course the French
                    were still testing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, isn't this their main testing area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, they tested in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact is this the main U.S. testing area after the
                        war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, yes, but we were no longer doing above ground testing and hadn't
                    been for some years. But the French, well, I don't know that they were doing
                    above ground testing, but they were still doing nuclear testing in the Pacific.
                    The Pacific islanders are sensitive to that. It was just coming on the horizon,
                    but environmental issues were of increasing importance, although global warming
                    was not yet on anyone's radar screen as far as I can recall...</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Q: Just before you come on board with the desk, the New Zealanders, the Kiwis...
                    New Zealand and the United States have this argument over nuclear issues and, in
                    fact, the Reagan administration writes them out of the SEATO alliance. Was any
                    of that impacting on your policy areas?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, it was. Obviously, we did not deal directly with New Zealand, but
                    this was an area of great interest to New Zealand and it was an area where they
                    wanted to show that they could show that they could still operate as an ally and
                    be helpful. So that facilitated our work in many ways. The New Zealanders were
                    very cooperative and helpful to us in the Pacific, as were the Australians for
                    that matter. I think the Australians always had the attitude that they needed to
                    educate us with regard to island issues and bring us along, which quite frankly
                    is true. To them, this is an extremely important area, and to us it was
                    obviously a secondary area. Although, I would maintain that again, in the U.S.
                    government structure, although the State Department might not have put great
                    emphasis on the Pacific islands, the defense department put a whole lot more
                    emphasis on it and CINCPAC for example was vitally concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you found yourself liaisoned a lot with the DOD...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, we worked a lot with DOD, probably more than most deskwould. They
                    were much more interested in Pacific affairs.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which brings me to the point, what did our

                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: We had an embassy in Fiji and in Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, both
                    small. There was a regional AID mission at this time in Fiji, although I think
                    it subsequently closed down. I think that is subsequent to my time there. During
                    the time we were there, we succeeded in opening one-man consulates in the
                    Solomon Islands and in what was then Western Samoa and is now Samoa, the
                    country's name changed. The Solomon Islands officer was accredited to both the
                    Solomons and Vanuatu and would travel between the two. That office has since
                    been closed as part of the cutbacks that we do. We also had an officer, as I
                    said, in what was then Western Samoa, Apia, and that office continues to this
                    day as far as I know. That was one of our great accomplishments of course,
                    getting that little office in the Solomons open, getting a U.S. presence there.
                    It didn't last too many years. By the way the office address in Honiara in the
                    Solomon Islands was Mud Alley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mud Alley.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The American Embassy on Mud Alley.</p>
                <p>Q: You were saying that the Australians were always interested in educating us
                    about the area. Are you talking local troubled politics on the islands, or why
                    they considered these areas important, or their attitudes toward French nuclear
                    testing?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, there was the nuclear issue. I'm trying to remember what the big
                    issue... The regional organization, or a regional organization which I guess we
                    were not members of or we wouldn't have gone along with it, but a regional
                    organization had a nuclear free zone...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Southwest Pacific Nuclear Free Zone</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It had an interesting, unpronounceable acronymic name whicwe pronounced
                    nonetheless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SPNFZ</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: SPNFZ, right. That was an issue, and with the ending of the Cold War, in
                    fact, I used to encourage the Australians to keep talking to us about it, that
                    things were changing and who knew what changes might be possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Australians and the New Zealanders were taking the
                        lead on the...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: When I say taking the lead, they understood that we were not going to do
                    anything in this area. Although they had carefully crafted it so it would not
                    impact, or they thought it would not impact on our defense missions and our
                    defense responsibilities around the world. Nonetheless, we were concerned about
                    the precedent and just what was involved so we were not prepared to sign on to
                    SPNFZ. They had been very careful trying to make it accurate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to figure out what our interests were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, so it wouldn't impact us. Nonetheless, we felt that we couldn't go
                    along with SPNFZ, and frankly all the nuances escape me just why, except
                    basically it was a precedent sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Q: That's my impression, because there's all kinds of nuclear free zones proposed
                    throughout the Cold War, and however well the Aussies had crafted this one, we
                    just weren't able to...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It allowed for free passage and non-hostile passage, and all sorts of
                    things were written into it that as I say were crafted to accommodate us and
                    make it possible for us to sign it, but in the end we couldn't. I think the
                    major issue was just the sense that it was a precedent that we couldn't set and
                    it would open up a Pandora's box around the world. But that was one issue, and
                    yes, the intratribal politics on the various islands, and frankly why the
                    islands were important or the need for stability. It's the sort of thing where
                    in Indonesia where the Australians take such a great interest there and think of
                    it as their Near North, and Papua New Guinea even more so. It's a former colony
                    and they have a fairly large expatriate community there as well as smaller ones
                    in Vanuatu and the Solomons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you probably had an officer or two in the Australian
                        embassy with which you spoke quite often.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes. They were in close contact with us on a regular basis. I got a
                    trip out to the area. I did not visit the scenic parts of the Pacific, although
                    I did spend some time out at CINCPAC out in Honolulu. But I went to Papua New
                    Guinea, the Solomons, and Vanuatu. Vanuatu, by the way, is a very... I only
                    visited the capital and drove a little bit outside of the capital and then from
                    there I went to New Caledonia, the French colony, which is an interesting place.
                    I only was in the capital city and you would think you were in the Mediterranean
                    there and you do not see very many native faces, at least in those years it was
                    very much a French town. Flew an awfully small plane between Vanuatu and New
                    Caledonia. And from New Caledonia I went to Australia and spent some time there.
                    I did not visit, I just landed to change planes in New Zealand, which was
                    somewhat of a chagrin to the New Zealanders who of course were interested in
                    talking to us and interested in visits even at my level at this point because
                    they felt neglected because of their non-nuclear policy. But we weren't being
                    hostile, we treated them as friends, but we didn't treat them as allies. We
                    weren't warm and fuzzy.</p>
                <p>Q: Right, and that proceeds to the present point actually with New Zealand. One
                    of the things that impacted it before you start on the desk, don't the French
                    blow up a Green Peace ship...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, they sure did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:...in Wellington Harbor so aren't the Australians and the

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes, the French nuclear tests is a big, big issue. And in New
                    Caledonia, there was an independence movement at that time. I think it was
                    settled with various agreements, but I think the native populations were restive
                    in New Caledonia as well, plus a certain amount of it in French Polynesia,
                    although that was less important. Our responsibility for New Caledonia and
                    French Polynesia was somewhat attenuated. The embassy in Paris and the French
                    desk had a proprietorial viewpoint, plus of course the French constitutional
                    arrangement was these are departments and not colonies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, it started falling apart before I got there. But,yes, we went
                    through a whole series of coups in Fiji.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues in Fiji as far as we were
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The issue, for those of us who have worked in Asia, is a very familiar
                    issue and that's race. The native Fijian population was I think something less
                    than 50%, it was about 45% of the population. And an immigrant Indian
                    population, and in many instances of two or three generations, who had
                    originally been brought over by the British to work on the sugar cane
                    plantations, were I think somewhat larger at that point, and in addition were
                    economically dominant, except that the native Fijian population owned the land.
                    And the land could not be alienated as it was owned by the various tribes and
                    clans and whatever their arrangement are there. I'm not an expert on Fiji. The
                    Indians had won an election and formed the government, and the military, which
                    was largely native Fijian, thereupon staged a coup. The first coup...</p>
                <p>Q: 1980...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I said, it was before I joined the office, which was in 1987, so I
                    would think that the first coup was in '87. The chronology gets a little dim
                    here as to what happened when. But a number of native Fijian political
                    leadership, the non-Indian, were nonetheless interested in constitutional
                    arrangements and trying to restore rule of law and so you had a tug between
                    those traditional political leaders and the new military leadership, General
                    Rabuka. Again, the Australians were putting pressure on them, the New Zealanders
                    were putting pressure on them to restore a constitutional order and restore
                    civil and political rights to the Indian population. This goes on long after I
                    left the desk. They did work out a new constitution which gave promise of more
                    equal... they're still trying to work it out. Those who know Fiji well, and I
                    don't include myself in that number, but I know people who know Fiji well, feel
                    rather discouraged by the whole thing and rather saddened because apparently
                    it's a rather charming, rather nice country with many nice people and it has one
                    of these seemingly intractable kinds of problems which don't offer an easy
                    solution. The Indian population, because of emigration subsequent to the coups,
                    is now less or smaller than the native Fijian population, but they still are
                    economically and culturally quite dominant. Although, as I mentioned earlier,
                    the native Fijians own the lands and the land cannot be alienated. Most of the
                    land was being farmed by Indians who held it in 99-year leases, and these leases
                    are all expiring, and what kind of arrangements are going to be worked out is a
                    big, complicated issue and terribly difficult... what kind of future is there
                    for the Indian population which is still over 40% of the population. Very
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>Q: So I would expect that if Australia is particularly interested in this that
                    your desk is probably writing a background paper on Fiji every time the
                    Australian foreign minister goes through town or the osman comes up or... those
                    kinds of circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Precisely. And we hold annual meetings with the Australians. Various
                    parts of the government get together regularly. It's a country, which you are
                    well aware, that we have fairly close, intimate relations with, and cooperate in
                    a number of areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Do you recall now, we talked about this, the two
                        island offices are then later joined with Australia New Zealand. Can you put
                        a timeframe on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was about the mid-'90s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because I worked with Mike Carpenter and he was
                        officdirector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, was he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of Australia New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands, at
                        thatime they were all together. So that was early '94.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, maybe it was early '90s that it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok. After the Pacific island adventure, you are still
                        iWashington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: My next assignment was in Personnel, was it not?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, and that was a very interesting and enjoyable tour, quite frankly. I
                    wish I had done it earlier in my career. I was a career development officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that what we called “career manglement...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, “career destruction...” there's all sorts of those. But obviously
                    you're handling too many officers, and I was doing political officers at the
                    four and three level at this time. I don't know how many hundreds of officers
                    that I had that I was the CDO for. Certainly it was a fairly large number.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you back up and give us a sense of how the office of
                        personnel is organized. You were saying you were doing fours and fives.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: This wasn't the office of personnel. The office we had was Career
                    Development and Assignments, CDA. It has subsequently undergone different name
                    changes. Within CDA, there are essentially two big divisions. One group of
                    divisions that are handling officers' career development. And this consists of
                    the normal cones, the political, the administrative, the consular, and the
                    economic cone. We each had two or three officers handling all the officers in
                    those cones. And there's also a senior officers' career development, but
                    obviously they aren't really being developed at this point. Then you have the
                    assignments. Each of the geographic bureaus has an assignments office that's
                    part of the same CDA and they're trying to make assignments to their bureaus
                    both domestically and of course their embassies. Those officers also were
                    responsible for various domestic bureaus, political military affairs. I forget
                    which office, whether it was European or Asian affairs did that, and IO had
                    somebody doing them..., etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the regional offices were hooked up with a functional
                        bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the NEA individual down there might have handled IO and
                        hmight have handled...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't really remember how that was, but they each had responsibility
                    for certain functional bureaus.</p>
                <p>Q: So on the one side, where you are looking at the officers' career development
                    and the other side you've got assignments. So now that is the officers are
                    divided into the cones and the conal system came in in the 1970s or so. Now
                    we're working in a system where for some time now state and Washington puts out
                    a list of coming available slots so that everybody knows what's coming up. In
                    the old days, nobody knew what was coming up. Mentoring took on special meaning
                    under those circumstances because it wasn't opaque.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, sure. Well, it was an old boys' network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now it's all very open.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, pretty open.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Q: Pretty open. This list goes out, the individual officer is told give us bids
                    off this. That comes in to you, depending on which ranked officer you were
                    looking at, right?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you're saying within the political cone, somebody
                        handled FS1s and 1-3s, and maybe 4s and 5s and 6s and 7s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, no, there was a senior officer and the junior officers (the Jos)
                    who were being handled by another group. We had three people working in the
                    political office. There was a guy doing 1s, there was a guy doing 2s, and there
                    was me doing 3s and tenured 4s. And everyone who was not tenured was under the
                    JO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's a tenured 4? A little bit taller? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: [laughter] Well, you remember the tenuring system where theare given

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. And as you say, the system is meant to be transparent and in many
                    respects it is. It was a very interesting experience seeing the care and the
                    enormous effort that goes into almost every assignment. You have routine
                    assignments where somebody is bidding appropriately and there's not a whole lot
                    of competition for a job and that guy gets assigned. That's pretty routine.
                    Although, in some instances, a CDO might look as somebody's bid list and say,
                    this guy doesn't know what he's doing. He's harming himself by bidding on these
                    jobs. And you might advise him that you don't really want to pursue this, and
                    even though it meets the needs of the service... well, if it meets the needs of
                    the service you might let him harm himself, and just say, well, you know,
                    everybody's got to be their own CDO. That's another one of those slogans, which
                    is true to a certain extent. I mean, you are responsible for seeing how your
                    career should develop, but we try to talk to people. We try to help them, we try
                    to push them along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, if the guy turns in his bid list and he's a FSO3

                <p>IFSHIN: You're not being realistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not being realistic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: One of the interesting things, one day a week we met in thso-called
                    Panel. The Panel was a very interesting exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who sat on the panel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Basically, we all sat on the panel. The director of the office, the
                    deputy director, and all of the CDOs and the assignment officers. You had the
                    front benchers, or the people who sat around the table, and you had the people
                    in the back. But if one of my officers was being assigned or a job that I
                    considered one of mine was being assigned, I would often be the one from my
                    little division sitting at the front table and certainly speaking on behalf of
                    my client. For the political officers, of course, it was always a question of
                    outsiders trying to get political jobs. It was always the economics officer and
                    the consular officer bidding on political jobs, and we would always point out
                    that there weren't enough political jobs and there was a surplus of political
                    officers. Every time a nonpolitical officer got a political job we were
                    aggravating that situation and some political officer who was assigned to a
                    nonpolitical job was not going to get promoted and was going to suffer, from our
                    point of view, because of this.</p>
                <p>Q: So, the system worked on the background that every job that was out there,
                    whether in Washington or out in the field, had a cone attached to it.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Well, not every job. No. There were many jobs thawere
                    multifunctional as well. But overseas, just about every job is...</p>
                <p>Q: Well, the list that goes out says ok here are all the political jobs and they
                    are ranked FSO1 down. And you look at your rank and you say, okay, I'm a 3, I'm
                    an Asia guy, here's the ten bids I'm going to send in. So now you are sitting on
                    the panel, and one of these jobs has come up and the guy who is sitting...
                    Honiara?</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Honiara. Well, the bureaus will often identify their candidates and if
                    they identify one of your guys, as you described it, here's the EAP bureau has
                    identified an O3 political officer for an 03 job, you're not going to fight
                    that. For one thing, you'll lose. I'm talking about as a political CDO, I'm not
                    going to fight it, I'm just going to go along with it. He's also my client, this
                    guy that they've identified, and he wants the job and the fact that I have
                    another client who I feel might be more deserving, or who I wish he could have
                    gotten it, or I wish they'd given him more consideration, I'm not going to make
                    a big stink about that or try to change things that are not changeable. But,
                    when they've identified somebody who is in another cone, or when the bureau
                    wants to give a stretch assignment, and of course there were all kinds of rules
                    regarding a stretch assignment, you can't assign somebody to a stretch
                    assignment...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please define a stretch assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, an 03 officer is bidding for an 02 job, or an 0officer is looking
                    for an 01 job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're looking for a job slightly above your current
                        personagrade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, and the rules that were operative, and I may not have them
                    exactly, and they may have changed since that time, but in those days, while you
                    had an at-grade officer bidding on a job, you did not make stretch assignments.
                    You couldn't. And there were also time frames when you couldn't make stretch
                    assignments. Early in the bid cycle, you could not make stretch assignments. But
                    at a certain point, if all the at-grade bidders had gone away, that is, been
                    assigned, then the bureau would try to sneak in their stretch assignments. But
                    meanwhile, you might have an at-grade bidder, who although he hadn't bid on this
                    job, was qualified for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or his other things had fallen through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Or his other things had fallen through, or didn't seem very likely to you
                    that he would get them. So you would be encouraging him to submit a bid. But as
                    a CDO you can't bid somebody. You can't bid for him. You have to get his
                    authorization. But you try to keep those jobs available, even though the bureau
                    is trying to slip in a stretch assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: So you have this list of jobs to be filled, and you've got your people who say
                    yes that's the one I want but my fallback position is this one over here. Is
                    there any particular way that the panel approached this list?</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the panel will not typically consider a job until the bureau has
                    pretty much made up its mind. The bureaus determine when the panel will consider
                    the job. At that point they'll have their candidate and say who they want.
                    Assuming that he's at the right grade and the right cone, that's pretty much a
                    fore-ordained thing. Although not always. Even then, sometimes we'll decide this
                    is not a good job. On one occasion, it was a woman seeking to extend in Mexico
                    City. The panel determined that it was not in her interest to extend in this
                    job. Although the bureau wanted her and she wanted to extend, we felt that for
                    health reasons and career reasons, we turned down the assignment. We wouldn't
                    allow her to.</p>
                <p>A point I'd like to make: the panel was extremely fair. Everyone was heard. And
                    you would be amazed at the amount of time devoted to a single assignment at the
                    04 or 03 level, the amount of thought...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is midlevel people, this is not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Or even junior level jobs. Some of them go through very quickly with a
                    minimum of fuss and feathers. It's just a rubber stamp type operation. But when
                    someone, and a large number of people, and this was about the biggest office I'd
                    ever been in. This was an enormous office. Bigger than some bureaus. It was
                    certainly bigger than HA was in those days. This was a really big office. And
                    everyone had the right to be in the panel room, and would be in the panel room,
                    typically on an assignments day and everyone had the right to speak. Many people
                    did speak. A great deal of thought and care went into assignments. If I say an
                    hour was spent on an assignment, I'm not exaggerating. We would examine every
                    aspect of it. People who knew the officer in question, people who didn't know
                    the officer in question, people who knew the job, people who didn't know the job
                    but had some other contribution to bring to the considerations. It was really a
                    very thoughtful and I think a pretty fair process.</p>
                <p>And the bureaus don't automatically win. I remember at least one instance where I
                    succeeded in getting an officer an assignment that the bureau wanted to give to
                    a former staff assistant as a reward and they made a big thing about how the
                    bureau should have a right to reward people who had done a good job. And 'this
                    person hadn't ever shown any interest in this country'... and I was able to show
                    that this was untrue and that's why I think I won, that in fact he had regularly
                    bid on jobs in the country involved, in fact it was Japan, in Japanese language
                    training. It was a very interesting and very illuminating assignment for me. I
                    wish I had done it early in my career.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Q: I'd had the same experience. I sat on a promotion panel one time and I came
                    out with most of my negative stereotypes in tatters because I thought people
                    really worked hard and they were trying to make it... In these panel meetings
                    were there rules, professional rules or unwritten rules as to what kind of
                    information you could bring to the discussion? Say the person being discussed
                    was a good friend of yours and you'd just been on an assignment together. Would
                    you be in a position to say, well, I just served with Dave and I happen to know
                    him...?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In fact you would. I don't whether there were any rules as to personal
                    material that could not be covered. Of course, there were personal things we
                    were not privy to. And I'd like to address that separately in a moment, because
                    this does not deal with panel type things. But we had access of course to the
                    personnel folders and we would read excerpts that favored our cause of course
                    showing what sterling officers they were and how able they were and why they
                    were the perfect candidate for the job we wanted for them.</p>
                <p>What I wanted to say was, in addition to our, in my case CDO, responsibilities,
                    we all had other jobs in CDA. One of the things I handled was handling people
                    who were on short tours. I'm trying to think of just exactly what the job
                    entailed. These were people who largely, for one reason or another, could not be
                    assigned and often had lost their clearance. Very often it involved alcoholism
                    or some other reason for withdrawing their security clearances. Nonetheless,
                    these people needed jobs. We would often find jobs for them. But sort of stuff
                    was held very closely, just what the problem was. Often it was my responsibility
                    to find jobs for people. I often knew there was a problem, I didn't know what
                    the problem was, and I wasn't supposed to know what the problem was.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of this sort of thing, one of my clients, in this day of... I had
                    a client who I knew that the reason he had lost his security clearance was that
                    he was homosexual. He had a court case where he was fighting to be reinstated,
                    but in those days DS had withdrawn his clearances. That wasn't that long ago,
                    but things have changed a lot, and they changed in part during the time I was in
                    personnel.</p>
                <p>I remember an officer came to me, in training in Arabic language training. He was
                    going to a very conservative Arabic peninsular country or he was destined to go
                    to one. But subsequent to his assignment he had discovered that he was
                    homosexual. He had a lover. He said he was perfectly willing to go because of
                    course he would be protected by his diplomatic status, but his lover would be
                    going into what was potentially a life-threatening situation because this was a
                    country where they executed people for homosexual behavior. So he wanted his
                    assignment broken. I took this situation to the deputy director general, and we
                    broke the assignment. The next panel that met broke his assignment. He
                    subsequently came up with a very nice job.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember an absolutely fabulous language officer, brilliant political
                    officer, and in the 1970s it was discovered that he was homosexual, and he was
                    gone.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: As I said, I had had an officer who gone through a similar process. He
                    had been “outed” in some sense, not personally, but I really don't know how his
                    homosexuality came to light, but he had lost his security clearance. He was
                    still in his foreign service and was trying to have his clearances reinstated.
                    But the whole time I was in personnel, I kept having to find jobs that didn't
                    require clearances for him so he could work and continue as an officer. But
                    someone who came along a little bit later, the deputy assistant secretary in
                    personnel, took it on his own to break the assignment and find him a job and not
                    call this to the attention of DS on the grounds, that as he told me, we'll never
                    win this. “If he takes us to court, it may take months or years and this may go
                    on for ever, but eventually he would win and the State Department shouldn't be
                    fighting this because we are going to lose.” This was in the period where we had
                    already lost the women's suit, which by the way I think was an injustice and
                    most of the people who were involved in it recognized that it was an injustice.
                    Many of the assignments and many of the complaints, if they had known why the
                    assignments were made and that in fact that they were supportable and could be
                    backed up it could have been shown in court that these were not gender
                    discrimination cases. But that's another story.</p>
                <p>Q: I had to read one of the statistical reports that went into that case. Or at
                    least a case in which they were trying to prove that women couldn't pass the
                    foreign service exam and that therefore you had to dumb down the test. It was
                    one of those things of bad statistics because it said X number of females took
                    the test, X number passed it, and that's not the same percentage as males taking
                    the test. What statistic was missing was, why were those females taking the
                    test? What they found out was they were wives or sweethearts of the guy who had
                    a master's degree in international affairs and they had an art degree and the
                    couple said, what the hell, why not?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Sure. For example, and this was something that we used to discuss as
                    panel fairly regularly. One of the things that happens in making tandem
                    assignments is that often one part of the tandem has to take a down stretch. Now
                    a tandem assignment is of course when a couple, both foreign service officers
                    are assigned to a post. A down stretch is when say an 02 officer is assigned to
                    an 03 job or an 01 officer is assigned to an 02 job. In putting officers into
                    the same post often those are the only jobs that are available and it has to be
                    done, if you want to keep them together, and they make the choice that they want
                    to stay together and one of them is willing to take a down stretch. Usually, it
                    turned out that the female half of the tandem was willing to take the down
                    stretch. We would always note when we made such an assignment that this was
                    going to look bad in our court records because it was another female being
                    assigned below grade. We were doing it to accommodate the officer and it was
                    voluntary on the officer's behalf. Nonetheless, it was going to look bad on our
                    statistics, and the judge who was reviewing our statistics was not going to ask
                    why was this down stretch made? It was just going to be another case of a woman
                    being put in a job below her grade. So we would always want to put the man, but
                    we couldn't always do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that woman's case was impacting on the way in which you
                        wernow looking at...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, this was subsequent to the judgment, but the court was reviewing our
                    practices. We were subject to having all our assignments looked at on how we
                    were treating women.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh, so the court case was over the final judgment hadn't been made, but you
                    knew what you were doing at the current time was going to be fed into the final
                    judgment or the attitude toward the final judgment.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Mhm.</p>
                <p>Q: Interesting. What's the role of the director general, in assignments?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In assignments of the highest level, and it's all kind of vague in my
                    memory because I didn't participate in those assignments. But as I recall, the
                    Panel would prepare lists of who got considered, for let's say consul generals
                    and jobs like that, but those were decided by a special panel which was chaired
                    by the director general. The director general, on occasion, would direct an
                    assignment. It didn't happen often, and we were usually not privy to the reasons
                    why it was being done. I think it often involved...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was higher level people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Not necessarily. Sometimes you had a directed assignment at the lower
                    levels. But usually I think it involved a court case or some such type unique
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't get the idea that it was just because somebody
                        wawell-connected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No. I don't it ever involved that sort of thing. It was always some
                    special reason which was outside. Again, I had a client, I don't want to dig up
                    too many skeletons and I don't want to identify people. I had a client who was
                    in the foreign service for compassionate reasons and it was a very difficult
                    assignment always. And this often ended up being a directed assignment, her
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. That would be interesting. On the basis of then what you saw and the
                    system is pretty still pretty much the same way, right, in this year, 2001?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I, guess, I don't really know exactly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What can they do in ten years? [laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There have been various name changes and reorganizationwithin
                    personnel.</p>
                <p>Q: If you were standing in front of this month's A100 class, just coming in, what
                    would you say to advise them as to how to guide their own career?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I would say that the system tries to be fair, but it is incumbent upon
                    you to be concerned about your assignments and to work on your assignments. If
                    you are bidding on a job and you're serious about that bid, you should be in
                    contact with the embassy or the office or the bureau, the bureau at a minimum,
                    that you are bidding on. Let them know who you are and why you would be good for
                    the job. Often that's the only information they have to go on, the bureaus. The
                    bureaus aren't seeking to school anybody by and large, and they occasionally
                    have their fair-haired boys and they want their fair-haired boys to go into
                    jobs, but they're not out to screw anybody. And many jobs, the only thing they
                    know about you is if you came in and saw them and spoke to them. As a CDO, I
                    don't want you, well, I want you to do it if you are my client, I want you to do
                    what you can to promote yourself. But of course, it takes control out of my
                    hands. But it's still something you should be doing.</p>
                <p>Q: Would you find people who happen to be in Washington come in to you and say oh
                    don't forget to mention this about me and I'm really interested in the PM job
                    and...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes...</p>
                <p>Q: Because I believe when people telegraphically submit their bids they also have
                    a little paragraph or so that this is why I'm so fabulous for this job. And that
                    helps you a little bit. And people could come or would come and you would
                    say...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes. Some people in Washington came regularly, and others didn't. As
                    a CDO you try and at least get a certain sense of the people. You try and talk
                    to as many of them as you can. You can read their file. You can have some sense
                    of what kind of an officer this was... you try and have some sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was asking this because when I was mentoring my junior
                        officers, I would always say, pick one or two people with whom you are
                        stationed and keep in touch with them for the rest of their career. Because
                        you may be overseas and your friend may be in Washington and he's going to
                        be able to scope out who makes this assignment or what it's about. That's
                        part of you having to be in charge of your career.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: A couple of things that I think I did wrong in my own career development
                    early on. I was always interested in broadening myself. I went from being a
                    political officer to being an economic commercial officer to being this or that
                    and did a lot of things. I thought this was great, it was preparing me to be a
                    manager and in charge and eventually an ambassador. But of course, promotions
                    especially in the mid-levels are basically what you did in your cone. You are a
                    political officer, you ought to get political assignments and that's important.
                    Doing assignments out of cone is a multifunctional, promotional possibility, but
                    basically it doesn't help you. You want to get promoted on the basis of what you
                    did as a political officer. The other thing is I was always interested in the
                    big fish in the little pond sort of thing. I was always looking for where I
                    could be in charge, or close to being in charge. For the reason that you just
                    pointed out of having broad acquaintanceships with people, I think there's a
                    certain advantage to working in larger posts where you do get to know a large
                    number of people and people get to know you. Subsequently, when you are
                    competing for a job, somebody knows you. And if you served at small places where
                    people don't know you, well, that's a handicap. It hurts you. There are
                    tradeoffs for everything. Everything has its advantages and its disadvantages,
                    but those are two things that I kind of noted.</p>
                <p>Q: You just raised something that I think we need a little background on too.
                    Promotions in the foreign service is a whole different process from the
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That is correct.</p>
                <p>Q: Promotion panels are convened basically in the summer. They read people's
                    files on the basis of files they rank people and that process goes absolutely
                    separate from the assignment process.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That is correct, except that sometimes we can't get a holof files because
                    the promotion panels have them.</p>
                <p>Q: Doesn't it also mean that you might come up with somebody that is right on the
                    cusp of being promoted and that would impact on whether he takes job A or job
                    B?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. Occasionally we would get somebody had an assignment and he would
                    seek to have it broken because he subsequently was promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It made he eligible for a whole new category...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, he doesn't want to go into a down stretch and this was going to hurt
                    him. We were usually reluctant to break those assignments, in fact, we'd say oh
                    it's not going to hurt you to do two years. You not eligible for promotion
                    anyway...</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Q: The timing... the promotion panels tend to meet in the summer and have their
                    results by early fall. The assignments... of course they are meeting year round,
                    but actually that timeframe is also rather compressed and unique, isn't it?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: The bulk of people are moving in the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the panels are looking at them in the
                        winter/spring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Theoretically, the two cycles should meet each other
                        smoothly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. You have problems occasionally, but it's seldom major. We don't
                    advise people on the basis of, well, I'm going to be promoted this next cycle.
                    That is not a wise thing to do. You might be right, but you might be wrong. You
                    do get people who are promoted and were assigned to a job which is now a down
                    stretch for them, and sometimes they come in and they want to break the
                    assignment. I don't think we allowed them do it very often, but sometimes it
                    happens. Occasionally you have someone who has a job, it's a desirable job, the
                    bureau feels that they're not going to have any trouble filling it. They are
                    willing to accommodate this officer who is presumably one of their people
                    anyway. So they will allow an assignment to be broken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As career development officer, you were looking at
                        differenregional bureaus, right? Not just Asia-Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you get a sense that the job requirement actually differed in different
                    bureaus, that an 02 in Paris what he had to face and what he had to do is a
                    different set of skills than an 02 in Africa?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I assume that there are differences in the job, but there are enormous
                    differences in the ways the bureaus go about filling their jobs. For better or
                    for worse, the European bureau tended to be picky and selective and very
                    clubbish, and it was hard to break into the European bureau if you hadn't done
                    previous European tours. The African bureau tended to be willing to take
                    anybody. If you'd been on an AF job, there were exceptions, but basically if you
                    had bid on an AF job and you were at grade and in cone, you were gone. They
                    assigned you. EAP was somewhere in between, more selective than most. NEA was
                    also, well, once you had the language, you tended to be one of theirs.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Q: That was true for any regional bureau. Once you learned Spanish or Portuguese,
                    you're not going to end up in Africa or Asia. It's the ARA Bureau.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: NEA... now we also had what we called hard-to-fill jobs, where we would
                    occasionally... a whole different set of rules applied, including sometimes
                    forcing people to go into those jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would define these jobs as hard to fill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It was defined by the number of bidders. You have jobs thanobody bids on,
                    but nonetheless they have to be filled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody has to clean the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Somebody has to go into them. Depending on a whole series of
                    circumstance, occasionally we would, again it was up to the CDO to sometimes to
                    persuade people to bid on these jobs and convince them on the desirability of
                    these jobs or the potential for enhancing their careers or how it's going to
                    enable them to go on to another job which they wanted. I remember a good friend
                    of mine and I think he had a good tour, and I was quite sincere in telling
                    him... he had bid on Moscow and didn't get anything. A fine officer by the way.
                    I convinced him to bid on Ulaanbaatar, or I discussed bidding on Ulaanbaatar
                    with him. And of course, he bid and he went like that [snaps fingers].
                    [laughter] I think he did enjoy the assignment, but he never did get to Moscow,
                    as far as I know.</p>
                <p>Q: You're giving the impression that the regional bureaus had a strong sense of
                    its people out there and how it wanted to fill those jobs. Did the functional
                    bureaus have the same sense?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Much less so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they weren't exactly in a position of taking what
                        thregional bureaus had left over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: No, it depended on the functional bureau that you are talking about. INR
                    always had a hard time filling their jobs. I had done an INR tour and we
                    discussed earlier and found it very rewarding. I enjoyed my INR tour and often I
                    advised, I mean this was my personal experience, I wasn't just talking, I would
                    tell political officers who hadn't gotten the desk job that they wanted that if
                    they could go into INR and working on the country or countries that they were
                    interested in, that they would be working intimately with the desk. And if they
                    did a good job, that the desk would think of them for their embassies. They
                    couldn't just assign their desk officers, they had to look at other people as
                    well.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Right, so I thought this was a good job for a politicaofficer.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed my tour in personnel and would certainly recommend it to anyone as
                    something that would be enjoyable and useful to their careers, preferably doing

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I think so. Usually, they are not hard to fill. They attract a lot of
                    bidders and personnel gets to pick and choose. They have everybody's records in
                    front of them. They make a big deal about we want to be very selective about who
                    we bring into personnel because it's important that we get the right officers
                    because we are making assignments for other officers. I remember that they asked
                    me to come down and interview for the job I had bid on. It was one of the more
                    interesting interviews of that kind. Very frank. Obviously they had had complete
                    access to my records and they knew a lot about me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: My last assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, your last assignment, 1991 to 1993. I turned the
                        papeover. OES.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It's an interesting office. Nuclear Safeguards was the namof the
                    office... Nuclear Technology and Safeguards, NTS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: It's an office that was then assigned to OES when I joined it although it
                    was subsequently transferred to PM. It's a non-proliferation office. Safeguards
                    is a term of art which refers to the measures that are taken to ensure that
                    nuclear material is not getting out of where it is supposed to be. It's people
                    who have nuclear materials and nuclear technology, or it's people who are
                    authorized to have it and it's not being used for any nefarious purposes. Of
                    course, the discovery of Iraq's nuclear program, which again was just about
                    contemporaneous with the time I joined the office, was a sign that safeguards
                    procedures which were being instituted by the International Atomic Energy Agency
                    in Vienna had not been adequate. A lot of toughening up of those procedures was
                    what we were doing.</p>
                <p>Q: So that nuclear oversight community, which would include state and the agency
                    and energy, were focusing again... because safeguards is obviously an issue that
                    was understood... but you are saying that this is further evidence that this is
                    an important issue.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. And it was also discovered during this time that I was in the
                    office, that South Africa had also manufactured a bomb. A little known fact.
                    They basically voluntarily dismantled their weapons program when the apartheid
                    government realized that they didn't have that much of a future and they
                    wouldn't be around that long and closed up shop and got rid of the technology
                    and materials that would have allowed them to build a bomb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody took it for them? For safekeeping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I don't really remember the details, but they basically voluntarily
                    decided that they weren't going to do this because they weren't going to have
                    control over the government very much longer.</p>
                <p>Q: And that sort of thing would draw all kinds of pressure. When I was in Taiwan,
                    the Taiwanese, Kuomintang, had played with the nuclear program back and forth.
                    And we had been watching that and tapping them on the knuckles from time to
                    time.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Sure. Right. Then the other issue I got involved in in that office was
                    nuclear safety, which has nothing to do with safeguards. This was post-Chernobyl
                    and Three Mile Island... of course, it's well, post them, but because of the
                    changes in the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, we were working
                    very closely with the Europeans and the Eastern Europeans in developing
                    international measures to increase the safety of peaceful nuclear reactors.</p>
                <p>Q: Just for administrative background, can you give me that line structure? You
                    are the deputy director in the office of nuclear technology and safeguards. Is
                    there a deputy assistant secretary in OES?</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Richard Stafford was our deputy assistansecretary. I don't recall
                    who the assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And OES for nuclear energy reported where on the seventh
                        floor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There was a specialist, I can't recall his title, Richard Kennedy was a
                    long-time head of the nuclear thing, and he was an S/... I don't remember
                    what... but he was a special assistant to the secretary for nuclear energy and
                    our delegate to the IAEA for many years. He had done this job for many years and
                    one of the real nuclear experts in the U.S. government in international affairs.
                    The office I was in had two foreign service officers. Myself and a junior
                    officer, who was in fact a nuclear engineer himself, he had been in the nuclear
                    navy and had come to the foreign service out of that. A relatively junior
                    officer. The other people were all civil servants. My boss, the office director,
                    was a lawyer. The other people were all nuclear engineers and nuclear
                    physicists. There was at least one guy who was a long-time nuclear type but had
                    his background in political science, I don't honestly recall. But people who
                    were all very highly qualified.</p>
                <p>Q: So this office has been in the OES for some time, and this is state's way of
                    monitoring the foreign policy implications of these policies.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: We worked very closely with the IAEA. That was our basic liaison. IAEA.
                    There were other international organizations that we worked with, of course
                    bilateral nuclear cooperation was also something we worked on. But we had a
                    major focus on the international atomic energy agency to the extent that we were
                    the principle office in the State Department dealing with that agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what kinds of policy issues came up during your
                        tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: What could be done to toughen the safeguards regime was a consistent
                    threat. Policies toward North Korea and their nuclear program was a major
                    element, focus of the office's work. Not mine so much, unfortunately; I would
                    have been interested in getting into that. And safety issues, which I did get
                    into. We were then working on and eventually did achieve, I believe, we were
                    pretty close to having a working draft when I left, of an international
                    agreement on nuclear safety, that is... what kind of international cooperation
                    could be established and what sorts of ground rules would be established for
                    operating nuclear power plants around the world. And it was recognized that
                    there was an international concern that if, as in Chernobyl, there was a nuclear
                    accident that this did not just involve the country in which the plant was
                    located, but involved its neighbors as well. So there was a need for
                    international ground rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the disappearance of the Soviet Union impact on
                        youoffice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It had an enormous impact. For one thing, we were also involved with the
                    various measures to control nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, along
                    with other people. But this of course became a major focus of the tension. The
                    people working in our office were very much involved in that aspect of things as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did the office do to illustrate its participation in
                        thoskinds of policy areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'm trying to think of what was going one. We had people who were
                    constantly visiting the former Soviet Union and working on the modalities of how
                    we were going to control this material and what could be done, and how we were
                    going to help their scientific establishment and in particular their nuclear
                    establishment. We worked very closely with ACDA, ACDA may have had the lead in
                    that area. Let me say that in some sense, this was not the most satisfying job
                    that I'd ever had, and it was basically, although I was the deputy director of
                    the office, you had these people who were not foreign service, highly trained,
                    very technical people who had been doing these jobs for a long time... and this
                    is something I've seen in other offices of this kinds, that there's a tendency
                    to see this work as being, having a very proprietorial attitude to their work,
                    and hold it very close to their vest exactly what they are doing, and how they
                    are doing it, and not to want to share and bring more people in on it. It tended
                    to be very closely held work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you had very highly skilled technical people and
                        thebroad brush foreign policy types...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right.</p>
                <p>Q: And you were trying to mix the two so that State could monitor these kinds of
                    issues. If somebody dropped a briefcase on that office, what kind of documents
                    would show up?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, surprisingly, I don't think we had all that much paper, or not all
                    that much highly classified paper. We had an awful lot of stuff classified at a
                    low level. I don't think we normally kept so-called restricted data or formerly
                    restricted data, although we were all indoctrinated, and I had all the
                    clearances. I had cosmic and Q and everything else you could shake a stick at. I
                    had all these clearances and sat in on all these meetings where highly sensitive
                    things were discussed. But it wasn't on paper all that much.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, it sounds to me like state's role in this was a
                        liaison role. Was tapping into the technical expertise and then saying,
                        look, here's the policy we need to follow to keep this technology within
                        certain bounds..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. And of course keeping the high level people in thState Department
                    familiar with what was going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Because obviously the Secretary of State is going to go to Russia, he's
                    obviously going to need a background paper on this sort of stuff and it's your
                    office that's going to put that in...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. Nuclear safety was always a major area for discussion and working
                    out of agreements. There was a general recognition that this was in everybody's
                    interest, so it was something we could agree on. Although the former Soviets,
                    the nuclear technology people in the former Soviet Union were sensitive to
                    criticisms of their technology and didn't like to be told that some of the
                    things they were doing were not safe. Nonetheless, I think it was widely
                    recognized that some of their technology at least... some of their technology
                    was excellent, world class, cutting edge, very good... but other things were
                    seen as not so good. Major potential problems.</p>
                <p>Q: Nuclear safety would have brought you into contact with other countries, like
                    Brazil, the French, all of whom have peaceful nuclear energy programs,
                    right?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. And it did, and we worked closely with the Europeanon all these
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do some traveling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I went to Belgium for a negotiating session. I don't remember what the
                    organization was but it included both the Europeans and the Eastern Europeans
                    and we were working on a nuclear safety protocol, which I'm sure must have been
                    enacted. We were very close. We had a good working draft by the time I left. By
                    the way, this was all being done by... I don't know limited official use basis,
                    unclassified. This was just to show that we didn't have a whole lot of highly
                    sensitive material. We were exchanging drafts of protocols constantly. It was
                    not sensitive in that sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these large or multilateral delegations, were there one
                        or twdelegations that sort of spark plugged the whole thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or everybody was all on board and it was so

                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: There's always a certain delegation... Everybody always looks to the
                    United States to take the lead on these things and sort of we are the number one
                    nuclear technology nation with the former Soviet Union as the other country.
                    France has a very extensive peaceful nuclear program, of course, and there are
                    other excellent programs around the world. Yes, not everybody plays the same
                    role. Everybody was active and I don't think there was any intransigence
                    involved in developing these things. They tended to be more legal questions in
                    just how we are going to word this in a way that satisfied everybody's
                    needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about liaison with the Congress? Were they kept
                        informed athese things went along? Or was that at a different level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: That was at a different level. I had nothing to do with the Congress on
                    these issues. There is a congressional committee dealing with nuclear
                    energy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would be briefed by OES?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Somebody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point did this office then move into the
                        politicamilitary bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: About halfway through. I think largely it was as a result of the Iraqi
                    experience. This whole thing sort of comes out of the Eisenhower administration,
                    Atoms for Peace. I think that's where this office gets created. That we are
                    going to share nuclear technology with everybody for peaceful purposes. That is
                    the IAEA's secondary role, or one of its principle roles is sharing nuclear
                    technology around the world. We gave little reactors to all sorts of countries
                    at this time. But safeguards is a term of art, became another important role in
                    the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and became increasingly important.
                    Again, IAEA has these inspection teams that go out and make sure that these
                    little nuclear reactors which we had given to people were being used as they
                    were supposed to be used, and that the enriched uranium, for example, is all
                    accounted for. And any plutonium that has been produced has been all accounted
                    for. This safeguards area, as I said in the wake of the experience with Iraq,
                    got increasing attention and the need to strengthen our inspections and our
                    procedures for safeguards.</p>
                <p>Q: I assumed that that meant increased observation or interest in what other
                    countries than Iraq... Iran is coming to somebody's attention?</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: A number of countries. And of course, the United States and particularly
                    the intelligence agencies had their own inspection methods and various
                    technologies that had been developed over the years for seeing if certain ions
                    are present in atmospheres or to be able to tell what might be going or what is
                    going on. And they were more sharing. The policy here was sharing more with the
                    IAEA so that their safeguards team could take advantage of some of these
                    technologies and some of these observation techniques.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any unclassified, worldwide human rights report
                        on non-proliferation being done at that time? That is,
                        non-proliferation...we're worried about this country or that country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I can't remember an unclassified report being by a government entity.
                    I've read such things, and I think they were done by non-governmental and these
                    tended to be pretty good where they rated the various entities around the world
                    and what's going on. Who has, what is the status of any potential nuclear
                    weapons program in country “X.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when this office moves to PM, is it just that office,
                        or dithe deputy assistant secretary move with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, and in fact, there's been subsequent reorganizations. But at the
                    time, OES had three nuclear offices. NTS and I don't remember what the other
                    ones were. We all worked closely together and we had our deputy assistant
                    secretary for the three offices. This basically takes place after I left, but
                    the three offices were all merged subsequently and the deputy assistant
                    secretary became an office director. The various office directors became I guess
                    deputies. Although the gentleman who had been my office director had already
                    moved on to, what is the domestic nuclear agency... NRC... Nuclear Regulatory
                    Commission, as the head of their international office. But I believe that is
                    their current setup, they are within PM and what had been three offices in OES
                    is now one office. There were other things that happened to work on nuclear
                    affairs within PM, and I think there are new offices as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the whole range of nuclear affairs, and whatnot, do you
                        thinstate's a viable actor? Did they make any contribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, there are certainly international issues that have to be done by
                    state and there's always a tension, I think, that you have long-term career
                    professionals who are not foreign service, their whole ethic and way of working
                    is somewhat different from the foreign service way which obviously I'm more
                    comfortable with the foreign service. We tended to be broader brush and kind of
                    more open as the idea is that everyone in the office should be kept apprized of
                    things that they need to know. Whereas, these people tend to hold on to things.
                    That's just my impression. Everything is held close to their chest and they
                    don't want to share. It's very secretive about what they are doing. But it was
                    an interesting and fun kind of job. These were interesting people to get to
                    know. I learned a lot.</p>
                <p>Q: The liaison with other government agencies that were in the same policy area
                    went smoothly...? Was there a policy issue that came up that there had to be an
                    interagency group set up?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There were a lot of interagency meetings, frankly. This was an area where
                    obviously energy had a big interest, and ACDA had a big interest, and defense
                    obviously. There were other agencies that got involved and we met with them on a
                    regular basis for various issues. I don't recall any great problems or clashes.
                    You always have different ways of looking at things, but there wasn't any great
                    hostilities or problems. There was an international project to develop a fusion
                    reactor. I don't know if you remember that. The Europeans, the Soviets, us and
                    the Japanese were all working together in this multistage project and eventually
                    of course the Soviets couldn't meet their budget. We were trying to accommodate
                    them by accepting various forms of technology as their contribution and
                    financing them. We were coming under more and more budgetary pressures about how
                    we were going to finance our contribution and eventually the thing broke apart.
                    The Europeans had devoted many more resources, it seems to me, to peaceful
                    nuclear activities than we have. But then we have a big military effort, and
                    peaceful nuclear activities in the United States, well, particularly reactors,
                    of course, we saw a standstill for better than 20 years dating from Three Mile
                    Island and those sorts of things where we just... our efforts just
                    collapsed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, OES is a functional bureau as opposed to a regional
                        bureau. Do have any final thoughts as to workload or...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, as a nuclear area in OES, we were part of but sort of separate
                    from... They were all doing environment and oceans and basically a lot of
                    non-classified. We were doing much more sensitive kinds of stuff. For example,
                    in the meeting that we subsequently learned was bugged by the Russians, perhaps
                    by the Soviets before the Russians, the conference room was an OES conference
                    room. We used to meet there fairly regularly. But whenever we met as part of
                    OES, at least when I was our representative which was fairly often, I tended to
                    be very silent at those meetings. Because the things that were being discussed
                    were non-classified and if I had anything non-classified to say I would say it,
                    but if I had anything classified to say, I just sat there quietly and didn't
                    talk about it. Because it just wasn't people who needed to know about those
                    things.</p>
                <p>Q: Sounds like one of the benefits of a functional bureau job is that you get to
                    touch base with a lot more countries. If you are on the China desk, you talk to
                    China, but here you are going to international conferences, you are talking to
                    the Brits, the Russians.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: But a lot of the job as you correctly pointed out is liaison with other
                    U.S. agencies that were interested in nuclear affairs. That was a major part of
                    our function. But I enjoyed it. I actually had taken that job at the time with
                    the idea that I was going to retire and that it would help prepare me for
                    something that I could do in the future. I still think I was correct. I applied
                    to a couple of nuclear firms, pointing out that the future of nuclear energy was
                    largely, for the foreseeable future, was in Asia. South Korea and Taiwan and
                    possibly China, and I had a background that I thought would be helpful to them.
                    There wasn't very much interest shown in that. I still feel my calculation was
                    correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired in September 1993. What have you been
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: For a year I lazed around. My wife says it was for two years. Maybe it
                    was for two years. And enjoyed myself. I took a part-time job for a while, but
                    that was basically small beer and not terribly interesting. And then I started
                    doing the human rights report in 1994 or 1995 and have done it ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is the State Department's annual human rights
                        reporwritten out of the human rights bureau which is now HA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right, which is now DRL, Democracy, Rights and Labor. When I was working
                    in it, I think I described this, it was under Plans and Programs within HA that
                    my office of multilateral affairs was merged into and they had oversight of the
                    human rights report which was done by this team of former foreign service
                    officers. When I joined it, the program had been moved to the office of asylum
                    affairs. The office of asylum affairs at that time consisted largely of retired
                    foreign service officers, WAEs working part-time on asylum affairs, and our
                    group of human rights report officers of the same ilk, that is, retired WAEs.
                    Subsequently over the years, the office of asylum affairs and, what's the
                    office's full title now? They've incorporated human rights report into the name
                    of the office, it's the office of asylum affairs and human rights reports or
                    some such... I don't think that's the actual name of the office but it has the
                    human rights report in the title.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can look it up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: In any case, they've hired more and more permanent personnel. A lot of
                    them are presidential management interns that they had brought on for two years
                    and have subsequently stayed on in some instances. It's a much larger office and
                    more and more people working on asylum affairs and on the human rights reports
                    and they still bring back a handful of us who give them that surge capacity
                    during the human rights report compilation.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, isn't that a bit of change? Because, I remember working on the desk, and
                    we wrote these things on the desk, well, actually you tasked the embassy... the
                    their report came to the desk and the desk sort of continued to reformat and
                    re-edit and then it went to an office, but it basically was in final already.
                    Now is it not as in final or...</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: The embassies and the desk still does what they always did, but because
                    we have so many more personnel working on the reports now, there's much more
                    fact checking. And with computers particularly and we now have access to the
                    Internet and all that sort of thing at our desks as well as confidential data,
                    the normal State Department databases, and these people have a lot of time, we
                    do a whole lot of... how come you did a report on this and Amnesty International
                    reported that such and such and such and such happened, what about that? Didn't
                    it happen, or don't you think it's reliable, this information, or what do you
                    think? And there was a press report that two people were executed summarily on
                    such and such an occasion, what was this all about? There's a lot more of that
                    which makes the reports much harder to do, and much more time consuming than
                    they used to be, for those of us who are working on them. When I first started,
                    basically we had an editorial function. We wanted to make sure that the reports
                    conformed to the style and format. Every report was supposed to follow the same
                    format. Every report uses the same language to describe the same sorts of
                    situation. We have lots of rules about inflammatory languages and avoiding them.
                    Occasionally we would ask questions. For example, if I was working on the
                    Malaysia and I was reading their religion section and they fudged around
                    conversion, and I'd go back and say, isn't true that a Muslim can't convert to
                    Christianity or any other religion? Well, technically they can, but it might be
                    life-threatening if they did, was the embassy's response. But typically, we
                    didn't do a lot of fact-checking. We just accepted the embassy's facts. We had a
                    little bit where somebody would have kept the file and had some clippings and
                    sometimes things got left out and we'd go back and say what about it. Or there
                    was a major coup in the country and we've ignored that, does it have any impact
                    on the human rights situation. This is not a human rights but surely the fact
                    that the constitutional procedures were abrogated and people were arrested
                    without due process deserves mention in the human rights report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the fact-checking that you do with the embassy... are
                        yosending a cable out to them, e-mail these days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Nowadays it tends to be much more e-mails and OIs than cable.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Yes. We used to do it with cables. Now it's much more the e-mail process.
                    Depending on the post. Not every post has classified e-mail.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Well, last year we started in mid-October and our reports are finished
                    the last day of February. And this year they want us to start in the middle of
                    September. I think that's for bureaucratic reasons rather than work reasons.
                    They want to bring us in on the old fiscal year, rather than on the new fiscal
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there's more reports these days, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Oh, yes. We are always adding new countries. [laughter]</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: The reports keep growing and they are longer every year. We have more and
                    more material. And now the Congress has added the international religious
                    freedom report.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: Separate from. Now we cover religious freedom in the human rights report.
                    It's a major issue. It has to be covered. But we don't cover it to the
                    extent...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the format of the report, is that pretty set, or has
                        thachanged as to its categories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: It's pretty set. We've added categories over the years. Labor rights came
                    in and got major attention at one time, it still gets major attention, and now
                    we are doing trafficking in persons that has become a major human rights
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who decides that? Responding to congressional pressure

                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, often it is. Women's rights began to get much more attention with
                    the Clinton administration and became a major focus at the time of the Beijing
                    conference on women's international... The rights of women, I can't recall what
                    the title of the conference was, but in any case women's rights assumed a much
                    higher profile. A year or two later children's rights and child labor suddenly
                    got a much higher profile. And the last two years trafficking in persons has
                    gotten much more. The original format of the human rights report as it
                    developed... When I say original I'm not saying from the first year but as it
                    developed over the early years is very much drawn from the universal declaration
                    of human rights. If you sit down with the universal declaration and you see how
                    it's laid out and what they laid out as human rights, that is the order with
                    which we treat human rights in the human rights report. We are just taking it
                    directly from the universal declaration and saying, the universal declaration
                    said that was a right so how about this? How does country “X” treat that right,
                    how is it handled in that country? That was the initial human rights report,
                    followed very much from international instruments on human rights. But as
                    international instruments have come to incorporate more and more areas, so has
                    the human rights report come to incorporate more and more areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As pressures or attention...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. A lot of this is congressional, or coming from within an
                    administration. With women's rights, the story was it was Hillary Clinton who
                    wanted this. I don't know if this is true necessarily but that was always sort
                    of the stick with which we threatened desks and embassies. We understand that
                    Hillary wants this.</p>
                <p>Q: At the highest levels. I would assume that if somebody wants to demonize a
                    particular country then they generate pressure for something in that area.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: There's always a certain amount of adversarial atmosphere to the
                    compilation of the human rights report where many desks and particularly
                    embassies, less so the desks, want to defend their country or want to cover up
                    or ameliorate or make it sound better or in some way not want to call their
                    country a human rights offender. And then your pariah states, Sudan,
                    Afghanistan, others, North Korea, that nobody's interested in defending and
                    nobody cares what you say about them and it's kind of the job of us as the human
                    rights gurus to write down the report. We don't use that language, this is not a
                    policy speech or something, this is a human rights report. We write it in very
                    dry, bureaucratic language. We try to keep the same kind of language to describe
                    things in every report and we try to be as accurate as possible and we try not
                    to speculate to the extent that we can avoid speculation. So for the countries
                    that don't have any defenders, we end up not as their defenders so much as
                    trying to keep the integrity of the reports more than the defenders of the
                    countries.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: In the last three years I have worked in the declassification business.
                    What they call routine declassification, documents that have reached the age
                    where they are supposed to be declassified. And it's been interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do you do that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, the first year I did it in Newington, where there is State
                    Department facility, a repository or records.</p>

                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Raiders of the Lost Ark. I understand that there are such buildings and
                    there's one in the Washington area and the name escapes me. The Newington
                    facility is large, warehousey, we're in offices, but there's a warehouse
                    attached to it where they have stacks and stacks of cardboard boxes with these
                    records. The first time I did this job I worked there. Some of the boxes are
                    boring. They are really dull. They are chron files and you are going through
                    page after page of really boring stuff. And sometimes it's exciting. You are
                    looking at the Seven Day War, the Yom Kippur War, or whatever war was developing
                    from New York, and I'm reading all the cables as they situation develops. That's
                    kind of interesting and fun to see how that works. The last two years I've
                    worked out at College Park, at the National Archives. Last year was particularly
                    interesting. I was doing records from INR which dealt with... the records before
                    there was an assistant secretary in INR. I forget the name, the director of
                    intelligence and research. It was the files of the director of intelligence and
                    research and some of these were dating from OSS creation of CIA and they are
                    working out of their relationship between the State Department and CIA. Those
                    were fascinating records as you might guess. Some of them dealt with... I
                    remember one long memorandum which spelled out all the potential problems, and
                    by God it was dead on. It was just exactly what happened. [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] Potential problems in this bureaucratic
                        organization...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. How this relationship was going to impact on thState
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because basically, INR was the research end of OSS, and
                        the CIgot the operatives and state got the records.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Right. There were some very interesting records. And you were mentioning
                    this year your having read U. Alexis Johnson's personal records. I was doing his
                    personal files. We all were. I wasn't doing all of them. I'd get a box and
                    somebody else had a box.</p>
                <p>Q: His biography is one of the best ones I've ready about Foreign Service
                    careers, called The Right Hand of Power. It was very interesting. Knowing who he
                    was and what he did, again, very American Foreign Service guy starts out... He's
                    a Midwesterner, Kansas or Missouri or...</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Actually he grew up in California, but his family originatein the Midwest
                    and then they...</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, they do and then he gets lucky and has the talent and the opportunity as
                    he comes up through the system and gets involved in all these fascinating
                    things. But those are his personal papers then?</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, I don't know about... well, basically his files, his mem-cons
                    dealing with meetings he held. The ones I was looking at, he was already a
                    senior officer. He was already the undersecretary for political affairs. Maybe
                    he had two tours as undersecretary of political affairs. I think he did. He did
                    that. He went to Japan as ambassador. He came back and was undersecretary again.
                    Maybe he had some other job before he went to Japan. He was senior in both
                    incarnations before going to Japan as ambassador. Those were the papers I was
                    looking at, surrounding the years of his period as ambassador.</p>
                <p>Q: As a segue into an overview of your own career, what advice would you give to
                    a college student who asks you, gee should I go into the foreign service?</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: I'm glad I was a foreign service officer and I enjoyed my time in the
                    foreign service. I'm not sure I would advise, I mean everyone has to follow
                    their own interests and do what they feel what they want to do. I think, in many
                    ways, for a white male it has not been, it's harder than it used to be. The
                    system is out to create greater diversity, and for better or worse, this results
                    in a certain amount of reverse discrimination. But it can still be a rewarding
                    career. It can still be exciting. I would also add, it's easier for a bachelor,
                    it's a little harder for a married couple. It gets much harder for families.
                    Many families do it and do it well. And the children thrive with the exposure to
                    different cultures, but not every family. It is certainly a more difficult thing
                    to do with a family. But if you are interested in international affairs, sure.
                    Foreign service. Great. A lot of good people. You're going to have a lot of
                    interesting experience.</p>
                <p>Q: On the interesting experiences side of it, I would expect too, that there's
                    different experiences with different generations. When you and I started, it was
                    Vietnam and Coke bottles through the embassy window. Now I bet you probably
                    couldn't get a good anti-American demonstration going in most of the old
                    places.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, maybe not the old places, but you still have...now we have
                    globalization and... You know, the United States as the world's remaining
                    superpower, to repeat a clich�, is always going to be the target of people who
                    are against modernity or who are appalled at the world as it exists now or the
                    direction we see it's probably going and we're around the world, and the flag's
                    out there and there will always be people who want to throw a brick or what have
                    you. Although the majority of the world is moving in that direction as fast as
                    they can.</p>
                <p>Q: Isn't that why we are talking about the foreign service as being the first
                    line of defense overseas. That is, the people on the ground watching the
                    changes, seeing how these trends are hitting the various countries and various
                    societies...</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>IFSHIN: Yes, well, I think the United States needs a good foreign service in this
                    era of instantaneous communication. Well, I was saying the United States needs a
                    good foreign service... the United States needs good intelligence about what's
                    happening overseas, good information about what's happening overseas. I think
                    having a government agency, a foreign service gather that information is good
                    and useful. It's clearly not the only way we will learn about what is happening
                    overseas. But there is an important role for the foreign service, yes.</p>
                <p>Q: On the analytical side, you've got capabilities and intent. It's the human
                    intelligence that State Department collects that gets you to the intent
                    issues.</p>
                <p>IFSHIN: Well, I suppose. We have so many foreign students studying in this
                    country... Well, we don't have so many Americans studying overseas, I guess
                    [laughter]. This doesn't prevent the enormous misunderstandings. Obviously,
                    relations with ourselves and Iran hasn't been helped by the enormous numbers of
                    Iranians who studied in the United States in the good years or the friendly
                    years. Now we have significant problems with China and of course, we've had
                    enormous numbers of Chinese studying in the United States. I don't know if that
                    has improved things or not. But managing those relations requires people who are
                    familiar with both cultures and can address the American needs thoughtfully and
                    foreign service officers are in a position to do that kind of thing.</p>

                <p>IFSHIN: I've enjoyed it. I didn't know we were going to take amany tapes and as
                    much time as we took, but it's been fun.</p>
