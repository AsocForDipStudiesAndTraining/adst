                <p>AMBASSADOR JOHN J. CROWLEY, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 27, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, could you give a little background of yourself
                        before you got into the foreign affairs business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, Stuart, I entered the Foreign Service fairly early. I did teach
                    English for two years at the University of Puerto Rico. Following that, I
                    entered the Information and Education Administration of the State Department,
                    which shortly afterwards was separated off and became USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had you gone to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I got my undergraduate degree at West Virginia and my master's degree at
                    Columbia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming out of West Virginia, did you get much in the way
                        of foreign affairs? Were you able to develop much in the way of foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, very little, Stuart, but, you see, I had spent only my high school
                    years in West Virginia and actually grew up in the southwest and had had
                    exposure to Spanish and lived El Paso and Tucson and Albuquerque, New Mexico, so
                    I had that kind of experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you developed rather early on an interest in Spanish
                        culture and foreign affairs and all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Somewhat. I think it coalesced during World War II when I was still in
                    high school. My aunt lived in Washington. She worked in the State Department,
                    and I met some of her friends, some of whom I guess were role models for me, and
                    my interest developed in that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, unlike many, you actually knew some people in the
                        State Department prior to coming in. The almost not quite universal theme
                        is, “Well, I really didn't know what the hell the State Department was or
                        how it worked until I came in,” but you'd had some of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I had at least the experience of meeting some Foreign Service people who
                    were stationed in Washington at the time who were friends of hers. I didn't have
                    much idea about the Department as a whole, but the people I met I liked, and I
                    thought I'd like to do that kind of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you first get into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I took my master's degree at Columbia and was hired as an English
                    instructor at the University of Puerto Rico, and after two years, I took the
                    Foreign Service exam. However, there was a hiring freeze brought on by Senator
                    McCarthy's investigation of the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Joseph McCarthy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Joseph McCarthy. And I was not able, even though I passed the written
                    and oral exams, I wasn't hired as an FSO. But I was hired as an FSS to—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be Foreign Service staff officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Staff, because of my experience in the cultural field. My first
                    assignment then was not as a Foreign Service Officer, but as a staff officer to
                    Maracaibo to work in the information center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing there in Maracaibo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Another fellow and I opened the place. We received a shipment of about
                    3,000 books. We found a suitable site, and we went through the leasing
                    procedure. We put the furniture in, and we went into business as the Biblioteca
                    Bolivar Washington, which was open for about three years. Unfortunately, in a
                    budget crunch it was decided to close it when I was leaving. But the books were
                    all donated to the local university, and we felt that we'd gotten a good bit of
                    mileage for the taxpayer out of our operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any sort of training at all, or did you just
                        sort of drop into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: In my Army service I had worked in public affairs and I was a writer for
                    a magazine. That, combined with the fact that I had been teaching in a
                    Spanish-speaking country in Puerto Rico, I think, is what convinced the people
                    in the State Department to give me a chance as a public affairs assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're going to sort of move ahead, but did you get any
                        impressions in how the United States was seen in Venezuela at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: One of the things that impressed me most in Venezuela was the fact that
                    my first residence abroad, not counting Puerto Rico, which, of course, is part
                    of the United States, was in a country which had quite a repressive
                    dictatorship. And for the first time I realized in the flesh, so to speak, what
                    it was like not to be able to have sources of information in a free press. We
                    couldn't buy Time magazine, radio was censored, people were arrested
                    arbitrarily, and it was a pretty tough regime.</p>
                <p>We were blamed to some extent for that, because right in the midst of this
                    dictatorship, the US Government awarded a medal to the dictator, Marcos P�rez
                    Jim�nez, against the advice of some of the people in ARA. But nevertheless, it
                    was done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea what was behind this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, it had to do with the feeling that he was a staunch opponent of
                    communism, and I think also because we had then about three and a half billion
                    dollars' worth of US investment in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about you were in Maracaibo from 1952 to
                        1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: To '55.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '55. Then you went back to the State Department for what?
                        Were you melded into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, unfortunately I missed the opportunity of having a class. Most
                    FSOs have a class and a class picture. But I was appointed FSO in the field, and
                    from the field I returned to Washington, and my schedule didn't track with any
                    junior officer courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: In '55. And I was already on my way to Lima. So what they did was to
                    improvise a short training course for me alone, and I went around to several
                    offices and did things on the job and then went on to Lima as a consular
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just stop for a second. [Tape interruption]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We're not going to dwell on your early time, but you went to Lima. This is 1955
                    to '59. You were there a fairly long time.</p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes. My first two years I was assigned as a consular officer. I worked
                    for my first woman boss, Sophia Kearny, who was a rather legendary figure in the
                    consular corps and a wonderful person, and she taught me the trade. After two
                    years working with her, I became the labor reporting officer. I think that
                    probably the high point of that tour was to see the effect locally of US trade
                    restrictions, because at that point Washington, in its wisdom, imposed import
                    restrictions on lead and zinc, both of which were important contributors to the
                    Peruvian economy.</p>
                <p>All my labor contacts I found to be up in arms about this, and I had to go around
                    and try to make peace with some of them and explain why Washington had done
                    this. So I attended rallies, and even street demonstrations, against the United
                    States, and, fortunately, they didn't involve me. [Laughter] They said he's just
                    the agregado de trabajo from the embassy. But it was an eye-opener to see, you
                    know, the effect that a decision in Washington could have on things abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I worked first for Ellis Briggs. Of course, he was another
                    legendary ambassador. And then for the late Ted Achilles, who was a very
                    different one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they were certainly two professional
                        ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes, indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they able to get anything done on this lead and zinc
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Not during my time there. It was a question of the domestic industry
                    here being able to have its way.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How to work in a situation like that? I mean, all of a
                        sudden you have something which you know is going to have a major effect,
                        and there you are as the labor officer and there is the ambassador. How does
                        an embassy work under these circumstances? What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, we tried to explain it reasonably and we tried to compensate for
                    it in some ways. Through AID, we expanded our labor exchange program. AIFLD had
                    not yet been created as the American Institute for Free Labor Development, but
                    Bill Doherty, who is now the head of AIFLD, was the inter-American
                    representative for some of the white-collar unions, and he had already started
                    the program up here at Front Royal to conduct seminars and classes for the labor
                    people from abroad. So we tried to expand that program, and we tried to get our
                    message across that this was something only temporary. And we hoped also through
                    the AID program that other compensations could be . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the Peruvian labor people looking at you at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, fortunately they had a kind of fraternal feeling for me as an
                    individual since they knew that I had been a member of the American Federation
                    of Musicians, and so I was “Brother Crowley.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you play, by the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I played piano. But they didn't have much sympathy for the decisions of
                    Washington, I must say, so it was kind of a damage-limiting operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the labor officer in an embassy, the labor officer is
                        often sort of the odd man, or odd woman, out, because traditionally our
                        interests in the Foreign Service is looking at political parties and not
                        labor, and this is a fairly new concept still. How did you fit into the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, organizationally I was in the political section. I was the labor
                    reporting officer, but I also covered some other areas. I was, I think, very
                    well accepted. I was covering the Aprista Party, which was a labor-based party,
                    anyway. As Haya De La Torre used to say, “The intellectual and manual workers
                    together form the party.” So everybody in the party felt, in a sense, they were
                    labor representatives. And since it was the second largest party in Peru, I was
                    not shunted aside as a kind of a labor specialist, but was treated as a
                    full-fledged political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trying to get some idea of how embassies operate, you said
                        Ellis Briggs and Theodore Achilles were two quite different people. How were
                        they different and how did they operate within the embassy and within
                        Peru?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Ellis Briggs, by the time he came to Lima, had been ambassador, I guess,
                    in six or seven countries, and he was well settled into the role. I don't mean
                    to say he was pompous, but there was a kind of air of majesty about him and he
                    moved with a lot of poise and he impressed people very much, both in English and
                    Spanish. He was a very kind person and very sociable, but he had a certain
                    hauteur, I guess you could call it.</p>
                <p>Ted Achilles, on the other hand, despite the fact that he was born to a large
                    fortune, was a much less imposing person. He was much more down to earth. Some
                    people might say that he was a little out of his element in South America. He
                    had spent most of his time in Europe.</p>
                <p>I liked both of them and I learned a good deal from both, but there was quite a
                    difference in their personalities. I would say that probably Briggs was the more
                    broad-gauged type. He had been ambassador in Korea, in Czechoslovakia, in
                    Uruguay. He knew many languages, and he was very cosmopolitan. He felt at home
                    in those places. And I think that Achilles, at least at the beginning when he
                    came from Paris (where he had been DCM) to a Third World country in Latin
                    America, took a little while for him to get accustomed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here was the second country you'd been in. How did you
                        feel was our policy towards Peru and Latin America in general? Did we sort
                        of take them for granted? Did you think we were giving sufficient
                        understanding to their needs and pride and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, in Venezuela we made the mistake of becoming too much closely
                    identified with the dictatorship. And after the dictatorship was overthrown in
                    1958, there was a tremendous outpouring of emotion against the United States,
                    and it took us several years to help to counter that. Finally, when R�mulo
                    Betancourt was elected president, he was a person who had always had ties to the
                    Democratic Party in this country, who had been a communist at one time, but had
                    become quite anti-communist. And through careful management of the relationship,
                    we built up to the point where we became relatively popular again in Venezuela,
                    but it cost us some effort.</p>
                <p>In Peru, we were not that associated with General Odria, and, in fact, General
                    Odria did us a favor in the late ''50s—I forget which year—by voluntarily
                    stepping down, which was a very smart thing for him to do because forever after
                    he could come back to Peru and walk on the streets and he was accepted like any
                    other citizen. Nobody was out to assassinate him.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I think our policy then, and certainly later, was perhaps too much dictated by
                    the interests of individual companies that were there. The economic side of it
                    always seemed to me a little out of proportion. On the other hand, we went out
                    of our way to show friendship and support as much as we could for the Apristas,
                    who were basically a sort of leftist, social democratic party and
                    anti-communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we weren't completely entrapped with the rightist side
                        as often as was happening in those particulars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: No, I don't think so. The fact that we had this large labor program
                    spoke pretty well for us, and we dealt not only with the Apristas, we dealt with
                    the Christian Democrats, and their unions, that is, Christian unions. The only
                    people we didn't deal with were the communists because, in my experience, there
                    has never been very much point in dealing with them because they are usually so
                    convinced of their own viewpoint that, you know, there's not much point in
                    seeking them out. But among the others we worked with a pretty broad
                    spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then had a pretty grounding in the labor field. You
                        went back for labor studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes. You see, the distinction between labor reporting officer and an
                    attach� was that the labor reporting officer, at least in my time, could be
                    assigned by the Department without necessarily consulting the American labor
                    movement. But the attach�, once you reach that level, the Department of Labor
                    and the AFL-CIO like to have some say, at least give their okay, to the job.</p>
                <p>Since my labor background consisted of being just a union member, they didn't
                    consider that without further specialization, I was really that well prepared to
                    do technical labor work. So I went to Wisconsin, with two other FSOs, that year,
                    and we went through a curriculum that was mainly in the economics department,
                    and had to do chiefly with technical labor subjects. And then I went from there
                    as—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1959 to 1960.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Right. And then in '60, I was transferred to Brussels, which, as you
                    know, is sort of the world headquarters of the international noncommunist labor
                    movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, I wanted to ask how did the
                        Foreign Service look upon labor specialization? Did you feel that you were
                        moving on the leading edge of something new, or did you feel that you were
                        getting into something that interested you, but didn't seem much opportunity
                        within the Foreign Service? What sort of advice and pressures were you
                        feeling as you moved into this specialty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I found it quite interesting, but I had a notion back in my mind that it
                    was not something that you wanted to spend your whole career in. And so at the
                    same time that I was pursuing it, I felt that I probably wanted to go on and
                    broaden myself to become a general political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you could do that, or did you feel once
                        you got labeled a labor specialist, that was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, having come from the Foreign Service into labor, rather than from
                    labor into the Foreign Service, I felt that I had enough flexibility, and it
                    turned out, in fact, that I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Brussels from 1960 to '64. What was the
                        situation there as far as you saw it? I mean, what were you dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I'll describe my arrival. I arrived with a wife and two small
                    babies in New York to go on to Brussels, and in those days, we could travel on
                    foreign airlines. We were booked on the Sabena, which is the Belgian line. We
                    arrived in New York and we called them up, and they said, “Well, all of our
                    flights are canceled.”</p>
                <p>And we said, “Why?”</p>
                <p>“Because we have diverted every available aircraft down to Leopoldville to
                    evacuate our people.” As it turned out, not only the whole Belgian air force and
                    Sabena was down there, but we had sent our transport planes down from the old
                    Wheelus Air Force base in Libya. There was a huge airlift going on out of
                    Leopoldville up to Brussels.</p>
                <p>So we finally, after a day or so, we got on another line and made it via London,
                    and we were quite exhausted by the time we got to Brussels. But when I did
                    report to work, they said, “The highest priority around here is to go out to the
                    airport and work in these 24-hour shifts to receive the evacuees as they come
                    in, because we haven't had time to document them in Leopoldville.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So I went out to the airport. My French was rather poor at that point, so I got
                    some fast practice. We were basically making a record of these people, because
                    it was expected that we would send them bills for their transportation, the ones
                    that came on US planes. [Laughter] But after we did all this work, it turned out
                    in Washington someone made a decision that it was a humanitarian operation and
                    they wouldn't have to pay after all, but that was my introduction to
                    Brussels.</p>
                <p>I went to work there as the assistant labor attach� to Arnold Zempel, who was one
                    of our leading—he was a real labor expert, had come out of the Department of
                    Labor. He assigned to me the local socialist labor group and the local Catholic
                    labor group, and he dealt mainly with the ICFTU, the International Confederation
                    of Free Trade Unions, and the other one which was then called Christian, and
                    which now they've taken “Christian” out because they have affiliated so many
                    people in Asia and Africa who are not necessarily Christians, but who have the
                    same kind of ethical philosophy.</p>
                <p>So that was quite an education. I learned about the international labor movement
                    by helping him, but I was also more specialized in learning about Belgium. At
                    the same time, of course, we had the Congo blowing up occasionally, and we got
                    called in to do things there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me deal with the Congo thing a bit first. What was
                        your impression of the people coming out of the Congo? Had they understood
                        what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: In the first place, there was not an awful lot of sympathy. I was
                    surprised. There was not an awful lot of sympathy in Belgium for these people
                    because it was assumed that they had been down there making a lot of money over
                    the years and there were tales about how they had exploited the natives. The
                    socialists, in particular had put this out. They had been exploiting the natives
                    and they kept the natives under their heel and they had made all this money, and
                    when they were finally getting thrown out, there was a large sector of Belgium's
                    public opinion didn't care very much.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, of course, the government did, and we worked with them on the
                    coordination of the later U.N. operation movement that came in to try to keep
                    the peace. But, in general, there was not a terrible outcry until later, when
                    the U.N. forces at Elisabethville, actually took aggressive action and some
                    Belgians were accidentally killed in that operation. That caused quite an
                    emotional outcry, and there were photos that were shown over and over on
                    television in Belgium, so it whipped up a lot of public outcry. That was
                    basically an Indian force that was serving under the U.N., but we got part of
                    the blame for it because we were looked on as one of the chief sponsors of the
                    U.N. operations in the Congo.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then back to the labor side, what did you do? Say you had
                        the socialist side. These interviews are being done for people who don't
                        really necessarily understand what people do at an embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Surely. We had some routine kinds of reporting, including studying the
                    wage levels in the different industries and reporting them here so that the
                    people in the Department of Labor in Washington would have a good idea of the
                    international picture, helping them make union directories, getting together the
                    numbers of people in the unions, and the names of the officers and so forth
                    because they publish an international directory here. We also contributed to
                    studies made in the economic section, to present labor costs and labor influence
                    and so forth. That was the technical part of it.</p>
                <p>The political part I always found more interesting. For example, in 1961, the
                    socialist labor confederation called a general strike in protest against some
                    legislation that had been passed. The government was a Catholic government. This
                    general strike grew to the point that practically all of Wallonia, which is the
                    southern half of the country, was involved in it. Stores were shut down,
                    factories, schools—it was really a highly effective thing. It seemed likely that
                    if the Catholic unions were to join with the strike that the government would
                    have to fall because it would create be such a ferment.</p>
                <p>Nobody in the embassy was able to find out what the Catholic unions had in mind
                    at the top, so they called me and said, “See what you can find out.” And I
                    remember going over to the headquarters and talking to some of my contacts. They
                    all assured me that the Catholic unions had no interest whatsoever in joining
                    the strike at all at that point. So I went back, and this was reported to
                    Washington. Fortunately, we made the right prediction, [Chuckles] and I had a
                    certain feather in my cap because I was able to ascertain that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were serving two bosses? I mean, was
                        there the United States, i.e., Department of State policy, and the AFL-CIO
                        Labor Department policy, or not? Did you feel yourself caught between
                        these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, not usually, because George Meany came frequently—the late George
                    Meany—to the meetings of the ICFTU and he basically had no great discrepancy
                    with US policy. In fact, he was, you know, rather conservative, and very
                    anti-communist. He was in favor of higher wages overseas so that foreign workers
                    would have more purchasing power. And second, because the cost of production
                    would rise so that our expensive goods would be more affordable in those
                    countries. I never saw any particular conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't feel any tug. Well, for political reporting
                        and all, you say that maybe we would have very little influence on the
                        communist union and the communist movement, but at the same time, there
                        often are areas of cooperation, I mean, mutual interest. Sometimes they just
                        dovetail or would want to know which way they're springing or what's going
                        to happen so that it is handy to have contacts within the communist's, i.e.,
                        often the workers' world. Were you inhibited from doing this or did we have
                        these, or was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: What we had was the socialist movement which had a spectrum from, you
                    know, right to left, and at the left end of the socialist unions, it sort of
                    transitioned off into the communists. I used to go out to that edge, and I dealt
                    with a lot of people. In fact, my ambassador one time chastised me for my
                    association with a guy there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: This was Douglas MacArthur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Douglas MacArthur II, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: The second, exactly. The nephew of the general.</p>
                <p>Because the fellow I was dealing with, Ernest Glinne, who later became a
                    socialist labor minister and was really quite respectable, was somewhat radical
                    and he talked a lot about socialism and the bourgeoisie and that kind of
                    business, but I found by dealing with him that he was basically
                    anti-totalitarian, so he drew the line at getting in bed with the real
                    Marxist-Leninists. In fact, he later promoted US investment in his district in
                    Wallonia.</p>
                <p>The socialists and the Christians in their unions had done a pretty good job in
                    Belgium of purging themselves of the really totalitarian types, both right and
                    left. The communists were only strong in a couple of very minor unions where
                    they were largely isolated. So I more or less agreed with the ambassador's
                    policy that since they were isolated and since the majority of the union people
                    didn't want to have anything to do with them, it did not serve our purposes to
                    be seen associating with them. On the other hand, by keeping up with the far
                    left of the socialist party, you could know pretty much what the Communists had
                    in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the communist movement within the
                        international labor movement at the time? We're trying to get somewhat the
                        perception of how we saw the world, and in your particular sphere, how did
                        you see it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I must say, I agreed pretty much with George Meany that there are
                    no free trade unions in communist countries. They're all government
                    organizations, and if the union doesn't have enough independence to be able to
                    bargain and to be able to speak freely, then, it's not free. I can understand
                    why we agree that they should be in the International Labor Organization for
                    political reasons. We accept it. But I think one also has to say they're not
                    really unions. It's like their amateur athletes. We compete with them, but we
                    know they are not amateur athletes. There were many front organizations that
                    they presented as unions which were not in my definition of a free trade union.
                    What we were trying to deal with and trying to promote was free trade
                    unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So moving on, how effective do you think American policy,
                        as you saw it, was with the labor organizations? Did you feel that we had a
                        role and influence, or was this sort of an amateur operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, in Europe, after World War II, the AFL-CIO helped to create the
                    anti-communist labor movement in France, because the CGT was
                    communist-dominated—the main confederation of labor—and we helped to create
                    Force Ouvriere. US labor was also active in helping unions in Germany and Italy.
                    If there hadn't been some outside help, the communists could have tried to wreck
                    the Marshall Plan for the recovery of Western Europe.</p>
                <p>In Belgium, we didn't have to do that, fortunately, because the Belgians
                    themselves defeated the communists—they purged a lot of them out of important
                    unions, and they ended up in, as I said, in some of these small, isolated
                    places. So I don't think there was any resentment, except among the far left and
                    the communists. We were helping the free trade unions, just as the Marshall Plan
                    was helping the economies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we giving any support to them? I mean, I'm thinking
                        of financial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes. Well, I know at least we gave office equipment. Irving Brown, who
                    has been on the international side of the AFL-CIO for many years, and I think is
                    still head of the—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He just died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Did he die?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, about six months ago, I guess. In Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: I didn't know that. Well, God rest his soul. He was the one who led the
                    campaign to start the Force Ouvriere, and I remember him saying he had to get
                    typewriters for them and desks and set up an office and get them telephones.
                    [Laughter] I don't know that it was a very big expenditure, but it was pretty
                    important at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the Belgian labor leaders
                        compared to some of the other ones? I mean, did you find them
                        different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: The division was pretty strong based on the religious line. You know, if
                    you were a socialist labor leader, I suppose you could go to church, but you
                    couldn't talk about it very much. On the Christian, Catholic side, they expected
                    to see you in church. So this divided Belgian political life and the parties,
                    and the labor unions followed the parties pretty much. There's more politics
                    involved in it, because a lot of people in the Parliament and other politicians
                    come out of the labor movement much more than they do in this country, so it's
                    more political.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, they're quite professional, too. I was impressed by the
                    organizations. They had good organization, good systems of education, teaching
                    the local union how to keep its books, how to conduct meetings, techniques to
                    use in bargaining, that sort of thing. So I would say the main difference,
                    probably, is that they are more openly political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Belgium in 1964, and you came back and you spent
                        two years in the Department. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, this was my second experience with Venezuela. I was the desk
                    officer for Venezuela for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Perez Jim�nez still the ruler, or had he been
                        ousted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: No. He had been ousted in '58. There had already been the presidency of
                    R�mulo B�tancourt, and there was the second president of that same AD party,
                    Raul Leoni. But it was the second democratically elected term. For the first
                    time in the history of Venezuela, they had ever managed to have two democratic
                    elections in a row.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One to another.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: That's right. It was the same party, but then, of course, the next
                    election they transitioned to the opposition party, which was the real test of
                    whether democracy was going to stick there, and it did.</p>
                <p>But the problems we had at that time had to do mainly with the oil market. The
                    fact that we had at that point the program called the oil import program. We had
                    oil imports limited on national security grounds that we should have more
                    incentives to discover oil in this country. You could also make the other
                    argument, of course, which was that we were draining out all of our reserves and
                    not buying the foreign oil, but at that point, the administration came down on
                    the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a philosophic argument, or was this one of the
                        local Texas interests and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: It was mainly the local interests, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this time when the Venezuelans were told they couldn't
                        send as much, yet Canada was getting a better deal. You know, it didn't make
                        much sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: You have a very good memory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it was Ambassador Bernbaum, or somebody who
                        at one point was talking about this, and attributed it to Senator Humphrey
                        and company.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, reportedly on national security grounds, they made an exception
                    for both Canada and Mexico. It was called the overland exemption, and the
                    rationale was that since both of these countries were contiguous to the US, they
                    were more certain suppliers and, therefore, we should let their oil in without
                    any quota. However, the thing that was laughable about it was that Mexico at
                    that point had no oil to export. So we used to ship some Texas oil down there
                    and transship it back up so there would be some record of barrels of oil coming
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Am I correct in saying this was a rationalization in order
                        to allow our people along the northern upper tier of states, particularly
                        Hubert Humphrey's Minnesota, to get their oil from Canada?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Sure. That was certainly a strong motive.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a political decision, internal one, but had major
                        repercussions. Now, did the Venezuelans buy this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: They said, after all, they had been just as reliable suppliers as
                    Canada, why should they be penalized? I must say, I was hard put to find
                    argument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was one of the times you have to sort of learn a line
                        and just keep repeating it, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes, I'm afraid so.</p>
                <p>That was one of our main areas of interest. The other was that they had an
                    insurgency going on in Venezuela that was fomented by Castro, there was the
                    great find of a large arms cache on the beach down there, which served as the
                    basis for condemning Cuba for the first time in the OAS, and then later, for
                    their suspension, when they ceased to be members. So that was a time-consuming
                    and important activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you do? I mean, here you are the desk
                        officer for Venezuela. You saw Cuba seeing Venezuela as being a possible
                        target, a possible weak spot, in which you could work. What did you do as
                        the desk officer? I mean, was this just reporting, or were there things one
                        could work with to try to stop this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, one of the things we did at that point was, with the cooperation
                    of the US Navy, we did some aerial patrolling in the area off the Venezuelan
                    coast, and suspicious vessels were reported and the information was given to the
                    Venezuelans. I don't know that they ever caught anybody, but at least this was
                    something we did.</p>
                <p>It was difficult because the coast is, particularly between the Dutch Antilles
                    and Venezuela, the waters are full of small boats, mostly smugglers, and it's
                    the kind of boat you might use if you were going to haul in arms, you know. So
                    it was very tough from the air for anyone to say what it might be. But anyway,
                    the sightings were reported.</p>
                <p>We also beefed up their military assistance. And, in fact, after I left the desk,
                    the program that we started resulted in the formation of several ranger units in
                    Venezuela, who were the ones who put the final coup de gr�ce to the
                    insurgency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time we obviously had a policy, but how did you
                        personally see the Cuban threat? Did you feel that Venezuela was vulnerable,
                        that Cuba might be able to do something, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, in those days, we weren't too far from '58, which was the
                    overthrow of P�rez Jim�nez, it revealed a tremendous increase in the influence
                    of the left wing there. They were never satisfied with the electoral process,
                    and that's why a number of them decided to go into the bush and become
                    guerrillas. It was widely known, for example, that we had many weekend
                    guerrillas there. During the week, they were at the Central University, and the
                    weekend, they put on their camis and went out to fight—yes, really—so that we
                    felt it didn't have any legitimate base. After all, it was one of the countries
                    with the highest standard of living in Latin America, and you had a democratic
                    government, you had a land reform program going on.</p>
                <p>In fact, I remember one short anecdote where the guerrillas came into a mountain
                    village and they came into recruit people, and they asked this campesino there
                    if he would join them, and he said, “No.”</p>
                <p>And they said, “Why not?” And he showed them his little house. He had a big
                    picture of B�tancourt, you know, R�mulo.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Because we have Don R�mulo and we have the agrarian reform, that's
                    why I'm not going with you.”</p>
                <p>But it not only failed because it was repressed, but it also failed because it
                    didn't have roots in the country. It was mainly a kind of intellectual, radical
                    program, of the stripe of the Tupamaros in Uruguay or revolutionaries in
                    Argentina, but down there, of course, there was a tremendous discontent already
                    which they were able to take advantage of which didn't exist in Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then we move to your assignment as deputy chief of
                        mission from 1966 to 1969 in Quito in Ecuador. How did you get this
                        assignment? This is always a sort of crucial assignment in the Foreign
                        Service career ladder, and how did this one come about?My question was, how
                        did you get the sort of very important assignment as deputy chief of mission
                        to a good-sized embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I think one of the reasons was because I had good lungs. There
                    were a number of candidates, some of them, for one reason or another, were not
                    accepted by the ambassador. The ones who were that were tested by the medical
                    branch (given the fact that they had to serve at a post at 10,000 feet altitude)
                    were eliminated. And finally, by process of elimination, I took the lung test,
                    passed, and I was given the opportunity. [Laughter]</p>

                    arrived there, I soon realized there was a good deal of tension—well, you could
                    sense it in Washington, but you could see it better down there—tension between
                    the embassy and the government there on the AID program and on the conditions
                    that were being sought by the United States for various kind of aid. In fact, it
                    had been a little bit much, and we had rubbed the sensitivity somewhat raw.</p>
                <p>So Coerr, I think with the best will in the world, made a speech, for which he
                    had permission from the Department, although they hadn't reviewed the text. He
                    told them more or less what he was going to say and the Department said, “Go
                    ahead.” He made a speech in which he very mildly put forward our side of the
                    question. It was immediately picked up in the press, and, in fact, I remember
                    the leading newspaper of Quito, the way they started the story it said, “In an
                    obvious retort to the president of Ecuador yesterday, the American ambassador
                    said the following and the following,” so the press put it right up as if it
                    were a shootout between the American ambassador and the president.</p>
                <p>But I still found it hard to believe when, a couple of days later, the ambassador
                    called me and he said, “Well, it happened.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “What?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I've been PNGed for that speech.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PNG meaning made persona non grata. In other words, told
                        to leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes. And what happened was that the Ecuadoran Embassy had delivered the
                    note here in Washington, and they couldn't find anybody on Saturday to deliver
                    it to. They finally gave it to somebody, and they took it to the op center. And
                    then when the senior people got it, they sent it down by immediate NIACT to
                    Quito, because we did not have daily plane service and the Ambassador and his
                    family had to plan to get the next convenient flight within 48 hours. So that
                    meant that he had to be out by Monday, and the Monday flight was less than 48
                    hours away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue? You say we were pushing too hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: It's not only my view, but I think it's been documented by scholars who
                    had better knowledge than I later, that the Alliance for Progress began with a
                    great spurt of idealism and enthusiasm, mainly the personality of President
                    Kennedy. And after President Kennedy passed from the scene, the idealism in the
                    program began to go away, and it became much more a matter of dollars and cents.
                    And in some cases, it became a gravy train for American business because of the
                    tied aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Tied aid” meaning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, in other words, the United States would give you, Ecuador, ten
                    million dollars to build a road, but you're going to have to give eight million
                    to this Texas company which is going to come down and build it. Tied to American
                    procurement of goods and services.</p>
                <p>This went to the extent in Ecuador that it was a real irritant, and then it was
                    compounded by the fact that the president realized that he could find and
                    exploit a political issue there, you know. So, when he went to the meeting of
                    Latin American presidents, at Punta del Este on the Alliance For Progress—what
                    year would that have been? Well, in '65 or '66, I guess. He was the only
                    president who refused to sign the charter, and when he came back to Ecuador, he
                    received a tremendous ovation. Thousands of people went to the airport, because
                    he was standing up to the Yankees. He portrayed US aid as a program in which the
                    US Government and companies were taking advantage. And he even issued a stamp
                    which showed him there pounding his fist on the table in Punta del Este and
                    saying, “By God, I won't sign it!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we tempted to just say, “Okay, if you don't want it”?
                        [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Unfortunately, Ambassador Coerr had tried to make what I thought was a
                    very reasonable speech, but the president thought, “Ah, this is another chance
                    to kick the Yankees.” I think he regretted it later. In fact, we were told by
                    various sources that he had regretted it, but there was no way to reverse his
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the president of Ecuador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: The president of Ecuador regretted having taken such a rash
                    decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a lingering anti-Americanism going back to
                        our role in—was it '42 or something like that—of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian
                        border dispute where we ended up as a guarantor of boundaries which the
                        Ecuadorians didn't like, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: I didn't detect a lot of—of course, there was a lot of anti-Peruvian
                    feeling; it has been for years—I didn't detect a lot of anti-American feeling
                    based on that. Because after all, the boundary was delineated. It has never been
                    fixed, but it was delineated by a Brazilian geologist, and that boundary was
                    then guaranteed by the guarantors.</p>
                <p>However, other geologists in the area dispute the physical findings that he made
                    there about watersheds, and the Ecuadorians said right away, “Ah, he picked the
                    wrong watershed. He meant that one. He didn't mean this one.” And in the
                    meantime, the poor fellow had died, and so now nobody knows what he really
                    meant.</p>
                <p>So it's a stalemate, and they have never been able—they were supposed to proceed
                    with putting in the markers. The markers have never been placed there because
                    Peru says, “No, that's the watershed,” and Ecuador says, “This is the
                    watershed.” But I didn't detect a lot of blame against the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we able to move away from this issue? One, did it
                        leave you as charg� for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I got a lot of experience in a hurry, yes. I was what used to be called
                    FSO-3, which I guess is called FSO-1 now. The ambassador departed. I got a cable
                    from the Department—or not a cable really, a letter—from Bob Sayre, who was then
                    the deputy assistant secretary, and he said, “We are not intending in the near
                    future to replace the ambassador here because of this offensive treatment that
                    we received and, therefore, you will be charg� for a while.” And he knew that my
                    only previous experience really was as desk officer. I'd never even been a chief
                    of section. But he said, “Jack you have to run it.” And he said, “I mean, you
                    have to run it.” [Laughter] So I got the word about that.</p>
                <p>About six months later, they sent the deputy inspector general down, the late
                    Spencer King, on a kind of a special look-see, and I must say I was pretty
                    nervous. But as he was leaving, he made me feel a lot better by saying he
                    thought I was doing pretty well under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what do you do? I mean, here you are, a relatively
                        junior officer in the system. A persona non grata of an ambassador is really
                        a major step. This is not a minor incident. This means relations are bad,
                        and one of the weaknesses of the whole diplomatic system, not just the
                        American one, is that the worse the relations get, the more the day-to-day
                        work devolves upon less and less senior people as you withdraw. I mean, it's
                        a peculiar system. But what do you do? What type of instructions were you
                        having? How did you see the situation? What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: We were instructed to just go on with business as usual, no new
                    programs. The AID director proposed—since it was the AID program which was the
                    source of the irritation—he proposed to have a major review with the senior
                    Ecuadoran officials of the AID program and see if there were areas where we
                    could reduce the tension and try to look at some of their criticisms. So that
                    was approved, and he then launched on this with some of his staff.</p>
                <p>On the other side was an Ecuadorian Foreign Service officer whose name is Jaime
                    Moncayo. The reason I mention his name now is that he's the current Ecuadoran
                    ambassador to Washington, but then he was one of the few young economists that
                    they had in their diplomatic service.</p>
                <p>This review took place over a period of several months, and it did not have a
                    satisfactory conclusion, and as a result, AID withdrew the AID director. So we
                    had a charg� in the embassy and a charg� in the AID mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the AID mission continued?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes, but with no new programs, only the continuation of what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>Now, in the meantime, what was exacerbating the situation even more was that we
                    were having the constant seizures of our fishing boats off the coasts because of
                    the difference in interpretation of international law. At that point, we were
                    still recognizing only three-mile territorial water and ten miles for a
                    fisheries zone, I think. We also held tuna to be a migratory fish which anyone
                    could follow into anybody's territorial sea.</p>
                <p>That was our interpretation, and the Chileans, Peruvians, and Ecuadorans were
                    holding out for 200 miles. This is what they based their claim on an action that
                    President Truman had taken during—I'm sorry, President Roosevelt. It was during
                    World War II, so I guess it was President Roosevelt—when he declared a 200-mile
                    security zone around the United States, which was intended to be just for the
                    war. But the people down there said, “Well, that would be a good idea to do that
                    permanently, so we'll just say everything in that zone is ours and it's our fish
                    and our security.”</p>
                <p>So over the years, we had a lot of problems with them, and it's interesting to
                    see how it's turned out. Basically, they have won, you know. That now is the
                    accepted position. The Law of the Sea Conference has come down on their side,
                    but at that time it still hadn't. And every time we had a seizure, we had to go
                    in to the Foreign Ministry to protest. We had to send a consular officer down to
                    the port to make sure that the crew was all right. We had to negotiate about the
                    catch and all that, because that would cause the inflammatory headlines in the
                    paper. Fortunately, this troublesome president's term was ending.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which president was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Otto Arosemena was his name. A new president was elected, the old man,
                    Velasco Ibarra. Washington, at one point, was thinking of sending a new
                    ambassador before Velasco Ibarra was elected, and I advised Washington that I
                    thought that would be bad—it sounded a little self-serving—but I said, “Why
                    should we reward Arosemena with a new ambassador? Let's wait and send a new one
                    to the new president,” and they finally did agree to that. And that's when
                    Edison Sessions came down and relieved me, because I had been charg� for 11
                    months, and we started a new regime. But the fisheries problem remained and the
                    AID problem was only somewhat improved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were improving the AID problem by mainly toning it
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Mainly, yes, cosmetic things. Also Velasco was not as tempted as
                    Arosemena was to keep making issues out of it. But I was there less than a year
                    with Ambassador Sessions, and then I left to come to the National War College.
                    And after I left, the fisheries problem became worse, and we retaliated by
                    cutting off their military assistance, at which point they kicked out the
                    MAAG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MAAG means military assistance group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Advisory group. I wasn't there when that happened, but that is the way
                    it evolved. It hit bottom, and we've been, I think, coming back up since
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We seem to have more problems in Ecuador than in many
                        other places where, in many ways, we shouldn't have these issues as much.
                        It's pretty much a democratic country. I mean, it's had its military juntas
                        coming in and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I think their policy in terms of the fisheries was more severe because
                    they had, unlike Chile and Peru, they had actually incorporated into the
                    constitution of Ecuador that the territory of Ecuador extended 200 miles to sea.
                    And, of course, it also extended 200 miles back from the Gal�pagos Islands, so
                    they had a hell of a lot of water, but not very much area in between. [Chuckles]
                    And they also were more energetic in enforcing, going after the poachers.</p>
                <p>The Peruvians and the Chileans sometimes would say, “We saw one of your boats out
                    there, and you better get it out or it's going to be in trouble.” The
                    Ecuadorians would just go out and take it, you know, and shoot some shots across
                    the bow and bring it in, and they'd say, “We've got one of your boats.” So they
                    had a much more energetic policy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself in a position where some of
                        our people who were fishing said, “Hell, we'll buy an Ecuadorian license,”
                        and we said, “You can't do that,” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: You're exactly right. That's right, yes. And, finally, I think that was
                    acquiesced to. It was after I left, but at the time, Washington was adamant that
                    they should not buy the licenses.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, they were being compensated. You know Congress had passed a law to
                    compensate them for any fine that they had to pay and also for any catch that
                    they lost. The fishing industry is small in this country, but it has a lot if
                    clout. I think, partly, because it's kind of romantic. You know, man against the
                    sea, and everybody says, “Gee, those guys are brave out there, and they're
                    picking on our fishermen.” So they suffered really very little financially.</p>

                        Domingo. How did you get that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, that was pretty normal. I actually had wanted to go to Caracas,
                    because my career interest has been in Venezuela. I tried to do that, but Joan
                    Clark, who was then the personnel officer in ARA, said, “But we want to send you
                    to Santo Domingo because the DCM from Santo Domingo, Frank Devine, is going to
                    Caracas, and the ambassador has already accepted you”—Ambassador Frank Meloy. So
                    I said, “Okay.” So it was just a normal assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation in Santo Domingo? You were
                        there from 1970 to '74. When you arrived, what was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: It was a relatively prosperous time. The price of sugar was up and the
                    price of petroleum had not yet taken its great leap. It was still about $4.00 a
                    barrel. The Dominicans sold a lot of sugar to us and other places; they had
                    plenty of foreign exchange. Not to say they were not a poor country, but they
                    have since been in worse shape. They are, in fact, in worse shape today,
                    relatively speaking, than they were then.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>As far as embassy problems are concerned, I began to run into security problems
                    for the first time. My namesake, Lt. Colonel Donald Crowley, the Army attach�,
                    had been kidnapped just a few weeks before I went down there. Fortunately, he
                    was released after the government gave in to the demands of the kidnappers. But
                    we began to see that we did have a security problem. The ambassador began to
                    travel with a follow car and bodyguards, and I had a bodyguard all the time I
                    was there, plus a driver.</p>
                <p>We had a security watch committee, and we declared different levels of alert for
                    the USG community. Some alerts meant everybody should stay home, and others
                    meant you could go downtown, but not to the beach. We had a very large post. We
                    had the residue of LBJ's huge civilian invasion which followed the military
                    invasion in '65 to help straighten the country out, and we had all kinds of AID
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general judgment in the embassy, not
                        officially, but among yourselves, about the calling in of troops and all.
                        This was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '65. I've heard varying accounts of it. What was your
                        judgment? You know, five, six years later, people who were around there are
                        wondering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: At the time, in '65, although I was part of the task force here in
                    Washington, my personal thought was maybe it was an overreaction based on the
                    imperative not to have another Cuba in the Caribbean. Based on the evidence,
                    though, it didn't look like we were about to have another Cuba.</p>
                <p>However, during my time there, when Colonel Camano Deno, who had been the leader
                    of the '65 revolt, came back into the Dominican Republic clandestinely with
                    about, I forget, 30 or 40 people, armed by the Cubans and apparently in a boat
                    that they bought for him, came in and declared that the savior had returned and
                    the people should all rise up. Then I began to think, this guy left here, went
                    to Mexico, he's been living in Cuba all this time and he visited the Soviet
                    Union. He's here with their arms and their money, maybe LBJ was right and I was
                    wrong about this. As you probably recall, the support he got in the Dominican
                    Republic was zero. Nothing happened, and, in fact, he and everybody got wiped
                    out in the mountains. I think there was one survivor. So I think that there is a
                    possibility that in 1965 the place could have gone the way of Cuba if we had not
                    intervened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often, in retrospect, it's very easy to say, “Well, it
                        wasn't necessary,” but you're never quite sure what you've squashed. What
                        was the feeling of the Dominicans towards Americans after this? I mean, the
                        fall in party lines, or was there sort of a general feeling of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: You know, Dominicans are conscious of the fact that, as they say, when
                    Uncle Sam sneezes, they're liable to get pneumonia down there. They're very
                    conscious of the fact that they are in our zone of influence. They know that
                    we're the largest trading partner, we're the largest aid benefactor, and all
                    that. Some of them accommodate to that very well. Others don't, and they say,
                    “Well, we don't like this situation. We want to change it.”</p>
                <p>Juan Bosch is one of those people, and the people in his party. So there could be
                    outbreaks of anti-American feeling, mainly stirred up by people like this. Not
                    long ago there was a ship visit down there and there was a violent riot just
                    because an American ship visit was coming in for the first time in several
                    years.</p>
                <p>We had threats that we received through intelligence sources against the
                    ambassador, sometimes against me or against military people. We didn't have any
                    attacks, bombings of any of our buildings, but there was a feeling of tension.
                    We did have a second kidnapping. You know, the late Barbara Hutchison, who was
                    the PAO, was kidnapped, so these things could always happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in Santo Domingo or the Dominican
                        Republic, American interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: They're so close to us and, as you may know from history, they almost
                    became a state. During General Grant's time, some of his cronies went down and
                    they figured that it would be a nice real estate speculation around Saman� Bay.
                    Well, you can't see it there too well on your map, but Saman� Bay is one of the
                    best natural harbors in the whole Caribbean.</p>
                <p>So they wanted to negotiate a deal whereby we would pay the government so much
                    money and then the Dominican Republic would be annexed and the Saman� Bay would
                    become a naval base, and these birds were going to buy up all the real estate
                    around Saman� Bay and make a million. Fortunately, it was stopped by one vote in
                    the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senator Sumner found out what was
                    going on, and he put his foot down and that ended it. Even though they had
                    conducted a plebiscite also in the Dominican Republic about whether this was
                    acceptable, and it came out some tremendous number of people in favor of it and
                    only 11 against. [Laughter] Obviously a rigged result.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>We've done a lot of intervening down there, so we feel, I think, we have to feel
                    a certain responsibility for the place. We wanted to see a democratic system
                    evolve from the legacy of Trujillo, and it has pretty much. And we wanted to, at
                    least in the State Department, wanted to keep the sugar trade up so that they
                    would have a decent income, but the Department of Agriculture has other
                    interests, of course. The domestic sugar people now have reduced our purchases
                    down there to the point where it's very serious for the Dominicas, and people
                    are going out of the sugar business trying to find other products they can
                    sell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So really looking at this, this is a case where, say, when
                        you were in Peru, American economic interests in Peru were quite
                        influential. In the Dominican Republic, our economic interests were such
                        that we were just trying to, at least from the State Department point of
                        view, help the Dominicans as opposed to American interests. In other words,
                        we were not involved in the Dominican Republic for economic purposes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: That's right, although we had some major investors there. We had ALCOA,
                    who were mining bauxite in the south, and we had Gulf and Western, which had the
                    most economical sugar mill. But if you take a minute and look at what Trujillo
                    did, Trujillo made the country his private preserve, and he took over
                    practically all of the profitable business in the country. So that when he died,
                    the state's influence there was such that they didn't privatize, which they
                    should have done, but they kept it all together. So they have about 30 or 40
                    enterprises run by the government, most of which have not been very profitable,
                    but they had the bulk of the sugar production and the other exports,so they
                    didn't have a lot of US investors that would come clamoring, you know, beating
                    on our door.</p>
                <p>But I think it's fair to say that they have been a—I hesitate to use the term—but
                    it's like a client state, and they know that and they need to operate within our
                    sphere of influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you're operating within this thing, and here you are
                        as a deputy chief of mission. You had two ambassadors while you there. How
                        were you used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, Ambassador Meloy, Frank Meloy, this was his first time in Latin
                    America. He was still learning Spanish, and he used me quite a bit in visiting
                    the number two official in the foreign office. Most of the other things I did,
                    though, were internal, because we had a large mission. We had AID and many
                    appendages of AID, we had a Peace Corps and we had the MAAG, so that there was a
                    good deal of administration to be done and coordination, mainly, to make sure
                    that everybody was adhering to policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID? Sometimes these programs
                        tend to be over-administered and run more for the convenience of the
                        bureaucratic apparatus of AID. How did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, in contrast to the program in Ecuador, which I think was serving
                    American business too much, the one in the Dominican Republic was very labor
                    intensive. The strategy of it was to soak up the unemployment so there wouldn't
                    be a lot of disaffection that might go over to the left and build pro-communist
                    and anti-American sentiment.</p>
                <p>So the reconstruction of the city, and actually the reconstruction of the damage
                    of the war, plus the rebuilding of old Spanish colonial buildings down there,
                    was an AID program which absorbed lots of people, thousands of workers, with
                    pick and shovel and paintbrush and everything. It was good for the country
                    because it made a real jewel out of the old part of the city. It was wonderful
                    for tourism. You know, the oldest cathedral in the hemisphere and then now these
                    buildings are there, Columbus' nephew's house and all that. So it served a good
                    economic purpose and, I think, good political purpose, and there was no way,
                    except for some Americans maybe selling them a few tools, there was no way that
                    a big American contractor could get in on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the AID apparatus itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I thought they were two very good directors. Strangely enough, two
                    succeeding directors, both named John Robinson. The Dominicans thought there was
                    some kind of plot. [Laughter] The first one, Jack Robinson, died just last year,
                    and the other, John, is retired. But they had, I thought, a good basic program.
                    They had some difficulty operating there because the Dominican bureaucracy was
                    not well developed, having been run as a one-man show for so many years.</p>
                <p>A book that I have read recently and which I'm reviewing for the Times of the
                    Americas is on the Dominican Republic, and the authors think that in the last
                    couple of decades, there's been considerable economic reform and democratic
                    progress. And they say now if the people at large can get a better share of the
                    benefit of all this, then they can say something has been achieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that we were calling the shots more than,
                        perhaps, we should have been as far as saying, “Well, you should vote this
                        way in the United Nations, and you should open up this sector of your
                        political life to . . .” I mean, were we being a bit big brotherish?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, when I was there, Joaquin Balaguer was the president, as he is now
                    again. At that time, I guess he was in his late '60s and he could still see.
                    He's a very astute politician. He's not terribly attached to the niceties of
                    democratic processes, but he goes along with them, although he doesn't really
                    think a lot of it is necessary.</p>
                <p>He would take our advice on some things, but on other things, he was very
                    independent. And if he didn't like a particular AID program that was proposed,
                    it wouldn't get signed. So I would not say that Balaguer is a kind of person you
                    could put under your thumb. He recognized our influence and our power and all,
                    but one of the reasons why the Dominicans liked him, I think, was that they knew
                    that—although he never confronted us the way Arosemena did in Ecuador—they knew
                    that he was a tough customer and that he would not give in to anything he didn't
                    want to.</p>
                <p>One experience I recall was Ambassador Meloy chatting with him one time and
                    saying, “Mr. President, you've been president now for two terms and you're
                    probably looking forward to retirement. Have you thought about a successor? Is
                    there someone that you would want to sponsor?”</p>
                <p>And Balaguer thought about it, and he said, “Yes, probably,” but he didn't say
                    who, you know. As a matter of fact, there was nobody, because he's been
                    re-elected twice since then, and could he's now 83 and blind. But I don't think
                    he had any successor in mind at all. [Laughter] He was considered himself
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p>Very interesting man. Never accused of any personal corruption. No need for
                    money. Lived in a very modest house, and really had nothing to spend money on.
                    He worked all the time. Even at his beach home he wore a coat and tie. The
                    problem was that there was a good deal of corruption in his government, and we
                    always thought that probably the military corruption, he definitely didn't look
                    at, because that was the way to keep the military happy.</p>
                <p>On the civilian side, it may have been just incompetence or ineffective
                    bureaucratic procedures. But it was not only common to him, this corruption
                    problem, because his successor, Antonio Guzm�n, later committed suicide when he
                    found out the amount of corruption that his own family had been engaged in, and
                    he was millionaire. He didn't need the money, either. So corruption, I'm afraid,
                    is kind of endemic there, as it is in many Third World countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, to make the next step, you went from this place to
                        becoming the director of northern European affairs in '74 to '77, which I
                        can't think of a greater contrast. What did this involve, and how did you
                        get this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, what happened was that, having served my four-year tour in Santo
                    Domingo, I was coming back to the Department and I was assigned as coordinator
                    of Cuban affairs in ARA. But in mid-flight, there was a policy enunciated rather
                    suddenly by Dr. Kissinger that people who had been too long in one area would be
                    sent to another area. I forget, there was a—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: GLOP.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Oh, GLOP, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: G-L-O-P, which stands for global placement, or something.
                        Anyway, the idea was to get people to serve in different areas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I'm glad you remembered that, because I'd forgotten. Anyway, the fellow
                    who was coming into the northern European job was sent to be Cuban coordinator.
                    [Laughter] Actually, I was a deputy for a year. I worked for Bill Buell, and
                    then Bill retired and I became the director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to stick more to the Latin American side. But just
                        quickly, what did your northern European affairs, what did that cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, it covered a wide range of territory. It covered all of
                    Scandinavia, Britain, Ireland, and the Benelux. But the way the Bureau of
                    European Affairs is structured, the functional bureaus handled some of the most
                    interesting business, you know. NATO was handled by a functional, not
                    geographic, office, but I and the economic office handled economic problems, so
                    that we didn't have a full plate of major issues and it wasn't quite as
                    challenging or stimulating a job as one might think.</p>
                <p>In fact, we did an awful lot of travel bureau type work, particularly in '75,-'76
                    during the bicentennial. We were organizing visits by royalty, you know, the
                    King of Norway, the Queen of Denmark, the Queen of the Netherlands, and all this
                    scheduling was very time-consuming and it required working with protocol all the
                    time. It was interesting, but as far as challenging problems is concerned, I
                    imagine, out of all that we had, one of the few would have been maintaining the
                    Navy base in Iceland and trying to maintain a receptive environment to it up
                    there by Icelanders. So our tiniest jurisdiction was often our most
                    critical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you? I mean, what did we have to offer Iceland, or
                        how did we keep relations with a country that is essential neutralist in
                        outlook?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, it's neutralist, but it is also a member of NATO. And the
                    territory, or the land where the base is located, is given free by the
                    government because, NATO members don't charge each other for base rights and
                    base rent.</p>
                <p>But the presence of 3,500 Americans in a country that only had 250,000
                    population, had quite an impact. They have a low birth rate there, and not a lot
                    of young ladies coming of age each year. I think there was a good deal of
                    jealously there by the younger Icelanders. They didn't like to see their girls
                    going out with the Americans. So there was a good deal of that, and there were
                    cultural problems.</p>
                <p>We had, for example, US armed forces radio and television. We broadcast the
                    normal American programming, and it could be picked up as far away as Reykjavik.
                    There was a big campaign against that, and we had to set up a screen to block it
                    off, even though the average Icelander was enjoying it and knew enough English
                    in order to understand. But the politicians grabbed it as a political football,
                    so we had to turn that off.</p>
                <p>You know, you couldn't drink beer in Iceland. You could drink all sorts of rot
                    gut they made there, but somehow beer was wrong, and a lot of times our military
                    wouldn't realize what was happening, or didn't know the rules, and they'd go off
                    base for a picnic and take some beer and they'd be fined.</p>
                <p>So we had a continual public relations problem. But on the substantial business,
                    they said, “We're giving you the base free, but we need certain improvements. We
                    need a better highway there, we need another section in the base for the—because
                    the base was used by both the military and civilians—we need a better passenger
                    terminal and so on.” We had a constant battle with the Defense Department, who
                    didn't like to go to Congress to get money for these construction projects. We
                    had to actually show progress in that field, and at the same time, we had to try
                    to mollify and conciliate all these other complaints.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we move on? Now this would be your third DCMship,
                        going to Caracas at last. You were there from 1977 to 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, I assume, was a fairly normal assignment. Had you
                        been asked for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, it was interesting. As I was leaving the northern European job,
                    there was a possibility I would go as a DCM somewhere in Scandinavia, which I,
                    frankly, didn't look forward to very much. And there was a possibility that I
                    might work for Ambassador Todman, who was then assistant secretary of ARA, and I
                    was of two minds about that. I would have looked forward to the job, but I had
                    just spent, you know, three years in Washington and I was anxious to get
                    overseas. So when Ambassador Vaky asked for me, I said, “Fine. That's where I'd
                    like to go.” [Chuckles] So I went to Caracas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pete Vaky is one of the well-known ambassadors. What was
                        his operating style?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, Pete is a very scholarly kind of person, but I don't mean to limit
                    him in that way. He, as you know, as far as I know, still doesn't have a Ph.D.,
                    but his ability has been recognized to the point that he teaches courses here in
                    Georgetown and he's at the Carnegie Endowment. So he is a scholarly person.</p>
                <p>He is also a surprisingly public kind of person. In other words, if you talk to
                    him, you get the impression of someone who's rather reserved. But on the other
                    hand, in a public setting, he is a marvelous speaker. I heard him give a speech
                    in Spanish that I was—you could have recorded it, and you would have thought you
                    had a native speaker speaking, and I mean Latin oratory. You know, not carried
                    to the absurdity, but moving, very, moving.</p>
                <p>So he is a person of many talents, I think, who doesn't flaunt them as much as
                    some other people. He's not flamboyant. He's very detailed. He was a faster
                    typist than almost any secretary in the embassy. He would come in early in the
                    morning and you would hear him tick, tick, tick, and he was typing up his
                    schedule and notes for the day. He's not a person of very many hobbies. I think
                    the only thing he likes to do besides work is the garden. He had nice flower
                    beds around the residence there. His Spanish, as I say, is bilingual. He had
                    good rapport with all the Latins, and he had good rapport with his staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did you play as DCM? How were you used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, once again, I was mainly an insider. He told me again, as in Santo
                    Domingo, to cultivate the senior people in the foreign office. Not the minister,
                    of course, but the vice minister, and that turned out to be a pretty useful
                    thing to have done, because this vice minister was one of these people who got
                    his hands on the way things operated in the foreign ministry pretty fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I did some representation for him. You know, speaking engagements and things that
                    he couldn't do, but it was mainly, again, inside work. We didn't have an AID
                    mission, but we had several other agencies. We had the FBI there and we had the
                    permanent IRS mission. We had the DEA, and we had a lot of kind of personnel
                    turbulence, morale problems, because of the high crime rate there. We had a
                    location that was when we put it there 20 years ago, out in the country, but
                    Caracas has grown so fast that it's now on a big, heavily traveled street
                    surrounded by shopping centers. Not a good area for security. We had a lot of
                    muggings, purse snatchings, house-breakings and that kind of problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do in a case like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, one thing we did, you know, we didn't have any hardship allowance
                    there, and we doubted that we could justify it because the elements of hardship
                    just weren't there. However, it seemed to me that people were sent into Caracas,
                    some of them for three years without any leave, into a very expensive place, a
                    place that had practically no recreational opportunities for kids. They had the
                    most horrendous traffic outside of Calcutta, plus the security problem. It
                    seemed to me they really needed to get out of there for a change.</p>
                <p>So the security officer and I got together and, with his statistics, I wrote a
                    telegram to the Department including all the problems we were having, water
                    shortages, and all the things that contributed to bad morale, and then a listing
                    of the number of incidents that affected our people in terms of being mugged,
                    robbed and so on. And I sent it in and said that although—with the ambassador's
                    approval, of course—although we were not applying for a hardship allowance, we
                    were applying for authority for rest and recuperation (R&amp;R), and lo and
                    behold, the Department accepted it. So, where there had been no R&amp;R before,
                    that meant people on a three-year tour, at the end of a year and a half got
                    their way paid home to Washington with their families. A single person could
                    probably have done it on his own, but somebody with children could never. So
                    that was one of the things that I took some satisfaction in, and it improved the
                    morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying you had contact at the foreign ministry at
                        the vice ministerial level, and this was very profitable. How was this
                        profitable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: For example, this is another inside case, but one of the children—well,
                    he was a young teenager—of an employee of the embassy came down from the States
                    and didn't realize that the culture was different down there and he wore long
                    hair and looked a bit like what we would call a hippie. And he was picked up one
                    night on suspicion of having drugs. I don't think he had drugs, but he had long
                    hair, which was definitely not looked kindly on by the police.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>So they locked him up, and when we tried to get him out the next day, this police
                    chief was adamant. He wasn't going to let him out, and he didn't recognize his
                    diplomatic immunity or anything. And so it was rapidly becoming a crisis because
                    the employee's wife was frantic and he was saying, “If something isn't done, I'm
                    calling my congressman.” So we got the Vienna Convention out and showed the
                    Venezuelans that it said in there that even though this—of course, he was a
                    dependent—that he was immune from arrest. In other words, he didn't have total
                    diplomatic immunity, but he was immune from being put in jail.</p>
                <p>So I went over to the foreign office, and the vice minister then called in the
                    head of the legal department, and he was shilly-shallying around, but I pointed
                    out to him that they had actually incorporated the Vienna Convention into their
                    own legislation and I asked if they were going to break their own laws? And the
                    vice minister said, “Yeah, are we going to break our own law?” [Laughter] So the
                    legal eagle guy said, “Well, I guess we'll have to do something.” So they
                    finally read the riot act to this police chief and got the boy out. That's a
                    minor thing, but those are the little crises a DCM is often faced with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because something like this could get played up. How were
                        relations with Venezuela during this period you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, our relations were good, particularly with the party that's back
                    in power now, the Acci�n Democr�tica. The main issue we had with them was that
                    they nationalized all the US oil company holdings there in '75 and had made only
                    partial payment in compensation. And so we were under pressure from—and it was
                    reasonable—to try to get the government to finally settle, because, you know as
                    the lawyers say, justice delayed is justice denied, and so we pressed them on
                    that quite a bit.</p>
                <p>After the AD Party was defeated in the election of '78, then we didn't have such
                    good relations.</p>
                <p>[End Tape 1, Side 2] [Begin Tape 2, Side 1]</p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I was just saying that the Christian Democratic Party in Venezuela has
                    always been more oriented toward that type of party in Europe, the French, the
                    Italians, the Germans, the Belgians and so on, and they don't have the relations
                    with the Republican Party in the US that the AD has with the Democratic Party.
                    And so, therefore, you could tell when they came in there was a slight
                    distancing. We didn't have the same rapport with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>But it was satisfactory. There weren't any great problems. I suppose the biggest
                    problem that we had was that we, frankly, didn't really know much about what was
                    happening at the end of Carlos Andr�s Perez's term (that would have been through
                    '77 and into '78) concerning the fact that he and Torrijos in Panama and the
                    president of Costa Rica, whose name I forget, and a few others, were conspiring
                    to send arms to the Sandinistas. And every time we got a report that this might
                    be happening, we would go in and all these people denied it. “Oh, we'd never do
                    that.” Finally, some of these arms were actually observed in Panama, and one of
                    our people there got some serial numbers and it was pretty clear that they had
                    come out of things that we had sent earlier, many years earlier, to
                    Venezuela.</p>
                <p>I think that, in retrospect, we felt that we'd been had to some degree, and I
                    think now, you know, Carlos Andres has shown in recent years that his faith in
                    the Sandinistas was rather misplaced, because, when they had their first
                    elections, he refused to go to the inauguration of the president there because
                    he said the elections were not fair. And now he's president of Venezuela again,
                    Carlos Andr�s Perez. He has also held them pretty much in arms length. But at
                    the time, these people were so anti-Somoza that they were somewhat blinded to
                    what was going to happen once Somoza fell and there was a vacuum. There was only

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Panama Canal business at that time? Did that
                        give us a shot in the arm as far as relations in that part of Latin America?
                        This was during the time when President Carter had—we gave up our control
                        over the Panama Canal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: It raised our stock, I think, all over Latin America—I saw in Venezuela
                    that they were very pleased. In fact, I remember President P�rez saying one
                    time, “If you keep doing this, there won't be any issues for the leftists to
                    come out and riot about.” [Laughter] “Your behavior will become too

                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: That's been solved since then, yes. The other major experience I had
                    there was, you know, as they say, if you ask an ambassador what are the worst
                    things that could happen to him, one of the stock answers is if you had an
                    attack on your embassy and some of your people were injured, that would be
                    terrible. Second, if Washington suddenly did a big flip-flop in policy and left
                    you hanging in the end of the limb, and the third thing is if you have a
                    presidential visit. Well, that's a disaster, also.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I was the control officer for the Carter visit which took place there in—what was
                    it—'79. And I must say, that was a rather traumatic experience dealing with the
                    hordes of advance people who came down, the Secret Service, who didn't care
                    about anybody except the president and his immediate family, and the rest of the
                    arrangements, they couldn't care less about, the local officials who thought
                    they were being pushed around by these Americans. It was a major undertaking.
                    And after we got them through that, in a few more months then Vice President
                    Mondale decided to come with his wife. So we had more than the usual exposure.
                    [Laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a Foreign Service saying, “One presidential visit

                <p>CROWLEY: I would endorse that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then a place where I don't imagine any president

                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I believe—I never saw it in writing—but I believe I was under
                    consideration before—you know how the system is in the Department. They make
                    lists of people. I think I was on lists before. But one time Lowell Kilday, who
                    was then in personnel, called me and he said, “If you want to, your name could
                    be on a list for Suriname.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Lowell, you know, I spent my whole career practically in Latin
                    America. I'm much more comfortable in a place where they speak Spanish, but . .
                    .”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, but you served in Belgium and, you know, they speak Flemish
                    there and so forth.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The language in Suriname being Dutch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: The official language being Dutch. So I said, “Okay.” And so, lo and
                    behold, it went through. They were having a bit of a crisis because the
                    democratic government had been thrown out in February of '80 by the
                    then-Sergeant Bouterse, who later became a colonel and the dictator for all
                    intents and purposes. And so I was sent there rather hurriedly with no training
                    in Dutch, and I hadn't really learned any in Belgium, either, because I was
                    concentrating on French over there. [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I arrived and presented my credentials to the last elected official, who was the
                    president. He was the only one—he still had enough prestige that the military
                    hadn't thrown him out. But a month after I presented credentials to him, he was
                    out, and from that time on I dealt with either Colonel Bouterse, or his
                    hand-picked government, which consisted of a civilian cabinet, but they all
                    answered to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, what were American interests in the
                        area, if any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: ALCOA had bauxite mines, an alumina plant and a smelter, plus its own
                    hydroelectric dam. That was a major American investment. It was still the eighth
                    largest aluminum producer in the world. Next to the government, ALCOA was the
                    largest employer in Suriname, so we had this big, sort of elephantine, you know,
                    kind of investor there, and nobody else. Well, Castle and Cook were there
                    canning a few shrimp, packing a few shrimp, but as far as investment, it was
                    this giant that had supplied the aluminum during World War II when other sources
                    were not available. And they had their own shipping line, and also we had that
                    to look out for, besides our own political interests in not wanting to see areas
                    of communist influence expand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with ALCOA? I mean, did they have sort of
                        their own foreign ministry and take care things? I'm speaking with some
                        experience. I was in Dhahran with ARAMCO, where they generally went along
                        with us, but actually they had a far larger staff and all. I mean, was this
                        a similar case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Very much. We were, to a great extent, overshadowed. Visitors used to
                    look at the ALCOA manager's house and say, “Well, he's got a much grander house
                    than the ambassador.” I used to say what you say, “He's got a bigger staff, too,
                    you know. A bigger investment.”</p>
                <p>We got along very well. Our personalities were compatible and he came to call on
                    me, you know, and he was deferential to a certain extent, and we became good
                    pals. So we had no conflict with them. Their policies were basically not in
                    conflict with anything we wanted to do. The only bad thing that happened when we
                    were there was the world price of aluminum declined, and they had to lay off
                    some people and that caused some friction with the government. But we had no
                    basic problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had, by this time, a new administration. It was the
                        Reagan Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you felt any of the repercussions of the change of
                        administrations? Because the Latin American field, I was told, there was
                        sort of blood in the corridors. And on the Latin American side, where
                        actually in Africa and the Middle East and other places, you know, it was
                        done in a workmanlike way, but there were some zealots who came in—I mean,
                        this is the impression I have—from the far right who were allowed free rein
                        in Latin America. Did you feel any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I think a lot of that was concentrated in Central America.
                    Suriname is pretty far out at the end of the line there, although it was in a
                    certain amount of light because of the fear, you know, that the communist
                    influence would grow.</p>
                <p>No, I didn't feel any particular change in policy. I think the frustration I had
                    all the time I was there was that we had always counted on the Dutch to be the
                    leaders there. They had an enormous assistance program. They had the highest per
                    capita aid program in the world, sort of like conscience money. You know, the
                    Dutch were saying, “Oh, we treated these people so badly we have to make
                    amends,” and, consequently, they had a very high standard of living and they had
                    very high sanitary standards and almost everybody was literate, and all this
                    Dutch money kept coming into the country. So the thought in Washington was,
                    “Well, why should we give them anything? You know, the Dutch are in NATO, and
                    let them take the responsibility. We'll set up a little embassy and we'll have
                    20 people in it.”</p>
                <p>When I got there, like any other ambassador, I said, “What are my tools?” I found
                    that we could send five or six people to the States under USIS grants, and we
                    finally got a little IMET program started, but aside from that, we had no
                    leverage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IMET is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: IMET is International Military Education and Training. But that was
                    around $50,000 annually, and the Dutch had these millions available. We had a
                    trade fair and we did things to try to stimulate interest in US products. I was
                    working on a proposal to start a limited AID program and possibly a Peace Corps
                    program. But what happened? Bouterse kept getting rougher and rougher against
                    the democratic institutions. The Dutch then began to say, “Whoa,” and then we
                    had to hold back on the aid. The people here in Washington said, “Well, gee, if
                    the Dutch are going to cut back, maybe we should do that, too.” And whenever I
                    would talk to Bouterse, he would more or less say to me, “Well, what have you
                    done for me lately and what are you prepared to do?”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>It was a rather discouraging climate, and my messages to Washington on this
                    subject, I thought, elicited less than reasonable responses. They always kind of
                    put things off, saying, “Well, we'll have to see.” Finally, AID did send down
                    John Bolton, who was the general counsel and who is now, I think, the deputy
                    attorney general (in 1990 he became Assistant Secretary of State for
                    International Organizations), and he came back and gave a personal report to the
                    head of AID, and then they agreed that they would start the small mission.</p>
                <p>But what happened was that in the fall of—let's see if I have my dates right—'83.
                    I forget when the massacre was, but I think it was in the fall of '83—that
                    Bouterse had about 20 people rounded up whom he didn't like, including the head
                    of the Free Trade Union movement, and ex-minister whom he thought was
                    traitorous, some media people and so on. He had them all beaten and shot to
                    death, and then later the explanation was that they had to be shot because they
                    were trying to escape, you know, ley de Fuga.</p>
                <p>In any case, then at that point, the Dutch cut off every penny of aid. Nothing.
                    And we said, “Well, we aren't going to give any, either.” I wasn't there at this
                    point, but I could feel for whoever was there, because he or she was left with
                    nothing. Our strategy then became, since these people are sitting up there on
                    the shoulder of Brazil, let's get the Brazilians to do something. The Brazilians
                    don't want Castro, you know, screwing around up there in the country next to
                    them.</p>
                <p>So they did have some success. The Brazilians were very lethargic because they
                    said, you know, there are many hundreds of miles of jungle between us and then
                    some. But, finally, they went up and they offered Bouterse some simple
                    stuff—boots and uniforms and some M-1 carbines and some trucks and a few, I
                    think, joint business ventures. But the deal was: no more encouragement of
                    Castro down here. So he's been playing pretty much by that rule and has
                    permitted elections.</p>
                <p>Now they have an elected government, but he's still sitting in the background
                    with the Army. Plus they have an insurgency going on in the part of the country
                    near French Guiana, so it's not terribly stable. But I must say that it was a
                    frustrating time, and I was caught up the rigidities of policy and there wasn't
                    any time to change it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Bouterse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, he was a very clever man. He had probably a high school education,
                    but he had been in the Dutch Army. He had been stationed in Germany and he spoke
                    German. He spoke fairly good English. His mother was Carib Indian and his father
                    was Creole, the name they give blacks there. He had certain superstitions. He
                    told me several times about things that he had to do, you know. Like he had to
                    go a certain time of the year and make a pilgrimage to certain shrines—they were
                    not Christian ideas.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>He was also a physical culture type. When the revolution took place, he was head
                    of physical education for the Army and a sergeant, and he was a natural leader.
                    He took over. They raided the arsenal, he and the other NCOs, they got their
                    guns out, they arrested all the Dutch officers, they put them on a plane, sent
                    them out, and they were in charge of the country. The only people they had to
                    worry about were the police, and so they went over to see what the police were
                    up to. The police took a look at them (all the police had were sidearms) and
                    they said, “We're with you.”</p>
                <p>I think he was probably surprised that he took over the whole country in 24
                    hours. But then once he got a taste of it, it was pretty nice. He became a
                    colonel and he indulged in quite a few luxuries around there, although he always
                    looked like an austere person. He always wore a camouflage uniform.</p>
                <p>My impression of him was that he was a person of no ideology, that for a while he
                    was swayed by these leftists, particularly when the Dutch cut off the aid and he
                    wanted to retaliate against them and against us. But after his friend Maurice
                    Bishop of Grenada was killed, and when the Brazilians came up and told him about
                    the facts of life, he retreated from that Marxist position, and what he wants to
                    do is just be in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself having to go up and say, “You really
                        shouldn't do this. You should be more conscious of human rights and all,”
                        and getting a rather fishy-eyed stare? Did you find yourself having to do
                        things that you realized weren't going to get anywhere but were
                        instructions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, during my time, you see, it hadn't come to the point of actually
                    committing these atrocities, and there were always doubts. If you went to him
                    and said, “Well, there ought to be more freedom of speech,” he'd say, “There's
                    freedom of speech. They can print anything they want to, the newspaper here.”
                    You couldn't really pin it down. Of course, once the murders were committed,
                    then he was over the hill.</p>
                <p>What I used to do with him was talk mainly—I talked some about local
                    conditions—but it was mainly geopolitical, saying, you know, it was bad for his
                    country to get off in this orbit with Grenada. And, as it turned out, Bishop was
                    murdered and so on, and this was not a good thing. But he always assured me, he
                    said, “Mr. Ambassador, your country has nothing to worry about from me from a
                    security standpoint. I know that we're in the US sphere of influence and all
                    that.” But his bottom line was really, “What do I think is good for me? How far
                    can I go?”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your find our invasion—or whatever you want to call
                        it—of Grenada, did that have a solitary effect in that part of the world? I
                        mean, the feeling that if they went too far, who knew what Reagan and
                        company might do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: I wasn't down there then, but I know that earlier in the Reagan
                    Administration somebody leaked a plan that CIA had been working on to
                    destabilize Bouterse, and the fact that it was leaked then killed it. But I
                    understood from people down there that this had quite an effect on him. He
                    thought actually the CIA was actually moving. [Laughter] He moderated his stand
                    on a few things.</p>
                <p>What I heard about Grenada was that it scared the hell out of the Sandinistas,
                    and some people said this is the very moment to go over there and negotiate. But
                    we didn't, you know, because the White House hard line was “no negotiation.” At
                    the time that we hit Grenada, they would have been ripe to talk to because they
                    were really concerned; they were frightened. But we let it pass. I don't know if
                    that's accurate, but I heard that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To sort of get on towards the end, you left in 1982 and
                        you were an inspector for two years. Without going into all the details of
                        it, how effective did you find the inspection corps at that time? It's my
                        impression that at one point, going back to the ''50s and ''60s or so, when
                        the inspectors came around, everybody sort of snapped to attention. They had
                        a lot of clout. I had the feeling later on that the inspections were done,
                        but you sort of had the feeling the inspectors' reports really were sort of
                        rather benign documents. Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I can only speak from my experience. I inspected about 20
                    countries, I guess, and people who worked with me were all pretty serious,
                    particularly what we called the AQIs, the audit qualified inspectors, looking
                    for financial problems and that. I found, in general, people were fairly strict.
                    There was a built-in conflict of interest, I must say, with the lower-ranking
                    inspectors, because it's quite possible that they might hold back a bit on
                    criticism of a senior, thinking that they might some day have to work for him.
                    This is one of the things, of course, that Senator Helms pointed out, and there
                    is some truth in that.</p>
                <p>I was a senior inspector. I was an MC and had been an ambassador. Even when I
                    inspected the European Bureau, I had a big to-do with the Assistant Secretary
                    and I changed some of the language that I had put in my report, but it had the
                    same meaning. In other words, he thought the language was inflammatory, and if
                    it were quoted out of context, it would make him look bad. For example, I said
                    that he ran the bureau with a kind of “kitchen cabinet,” and he objected to that
                    very much. So I said, “All right. Let's put down here that you run the bureau
                    with a group of close-knit advisors.” He said, “Okay.” [Laughter]</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>So the other thing I thought was good about inspecting was that it gave you such
                    a marvelous bird's-eye view of everything. You know, you can see the whole
                    operation of the embassy. When you get the inspection team together and they
                    say, “I've seen so-and-so today and I've seen this,” you get a picture of
                    embassy operations I don't think you can get any other way, unless maybe you're
                    the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your overall impression of how the Foreign
                        Service was run—this is in the early '80s—from your inspections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, you know, we saw all those problems that were common in posts.
                    Where the wives were able to work, we had good morale, and where the wives
                    weren't able to work—or spouses, I should say, low morale—that was almost a
                    measuring rod you could use. The style of the ambassador was very important. We
                    had a lot of ambassadors who were very caring and very open, like some who said,
                    “Call me by my first name,” and that kind of thing. We had others who were very
                    distant, who never dealt with the staff at all, and let the other people deal
                    with it.</p>
                <p>But, in general, I thought we were doing a pretty good job. One thing we tried to
                    do was quantify political reporting, which was very hard to do. But we got to
                    the point where we would take all of the political reporting for a whole year
                    and survey it and appraise it, according to a matrix that one of our people put
                    together, and try to weigh it and have it evaluated that way and then have
                    someone also evaluate it separately in the old-fashioned way, and it was quite
                    surprising how they would match. So now they're using that system more often,
                    instead of just doing the horseback evaluation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression about the various major
                        bureaus? Was there much of a contrast between, say the African, Middle East,
                        Latin American bureaus? Could you weigh them or say there's a problem
                        more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, no. I didn't see anything. You know, they have their reputations,
                    I think, but it depends which bureau you're in as to how you feel about the
                    others, so I don't think there's anything very scientific you could say about
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>EUR, of course, is still the largest bureau, has the most people, has the most
                    posts, actually, even still larger than Africa. And it is the one that, except
                    for people who are kind of specialized, like yours truly, it's the one I think
                    generally people would like to be in. However, there is a price to be paid at
                    the senior level in that very few ambassadorships in EUR go to career people.
                    Whereas, as you know, if you can stick it out in Africa, you have a fair chance
                    of getting one of the—what is it they have, 35 embassies down there? But I would
                    say if more younger people could somehow be exposed to the inspection process,
                    it would be excellent, because they would learn an awful lot in a very short
                    time about how things actually work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to you last assignment, you were a deputy US
                        representative to the OAS in 1984 to '86. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I suppose, Stuart, you could say that was my last DCM shot. I may
                    have set some kind of record, because I was a DCM in four different jobs and I
                    worked for eight different ambassadors. And, as somebody said to me, “You're
                    lucky none of the eight ever kicked you out,” because it's a fairly common
                    occurrence. [Laughter] So I guess I must have been doing something right.</p>
                <p>By the time I got to this job, the OAS had been in decline for some time, decline
                    simply because the members had decided that there were better channels to use.
                    The ones who didn't like certain things about the OAS would take their cases to
                    the U.N., or people wouldn't take anything to it. I must say, frankly, some of
                    my first meetings at the Permanent Council were rather discouraging. We would
                    discuss what should be the pension of a retiring gardener. [Laughter] This is
                    the council representing ministers, you know, at ambassadorial level.</p>
                <p>Then the previous Secretary General, who had just left, Alejandro Orfila, had
                    brought some, perhaps unfavorable publicity to the OAS because of his flamboyant
                    lifestyle and the fact that when he left, he had already been working for Gray
                    and Company, the public relations firm, had received several thousand dollars
                    prior to his departure that he hadn't told anybody about and the fact that he
                    fired his secretary, as it turned out later, so that she could receive the
                    benefits of severance rather than having her quit, and then he immediately hired
                    her over at Gray. So there were little, you know, minor scandals going on.</p>
                <p>But it was rather disappointing in that nobody seemed to use it for, you know,
                    substantive reasons—now, fortunately, there's been an opportunity in Central
                    America for it to have a bit more of a role, and they were in, as you know, on
                    the cease-fire between the Contras and the Sandinistas. And now there's this
                    mission which—I wish them luck—they're trying to talk General Torrijos into
                    stepping down. If they do that, I think—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean Noriega?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CROWLEY: I'm sorry, Noriega. Excuse me. It'll be quite a feather in their cap,
                    and it could help to raise their stock, and then maybe the countries, the
                    members, will take another look at it and say, “We can do some effective things
                    here after all.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Jack, it's been a long interview. There are sort of
                        two questions that we usually ask. Looking back on your career, what gave
                        you the greatest satisfaction, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Well, I suppose it's not any great accomplishment in foreign affairs,
                    but the fact that, as a young, fairly inexperienced officer in Ecuador, I was
                    suddenly put in charge of one of the 20 largest missions in the world and
                    managed to run it for 11 months without causing any disasters. [Laughter] I
                    think probably I look back on that as one of the things to be proud of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The last one is if a young—and I imagine they do—a young
                        person comes to you, man or woman, and says, “You know, I'm interested in
                        the Foreign Service as a career,” how do you advise them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: The Foreign Service, of course, is a lot different now, Stuart, as you
                    know. I came in at age 24. I know others, for example, Ted Briggs, Ellis Briggs'
                    son, came in very young. He was only 22. I mean, we had never done anything
                    else, almost fresh out of school, right into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>If you look now at the average age and education of people who are coming in,
                    they're well up into their '30s, and many have Ph.D.s. It's a different mind-set
                    also. It's a group of people—I don't want to cast any aspersions on them—but I
                    suspect they're not as amenable to, let's say, to the kind of discipline and the
                    kind of spirit that we used to try to instill in the younger officers. They've
                    been around more, they are more sophisticated, and they think more for
                    themselves and so on. So I would have to ask this person if this is the kind of
                    group they would feel comfortable with, dealing with a lot of people who are
                    maybe former assistant professors of international relations or whatever and
                    instead of the kind of younger, more generally educated, less specialized, less
                    experienced kind of group.</p>
                <p>Also, one would have to point out, although it would probably be unnecessary,
                    that service abroad is a lot more dangerous now than it used to be. When I first
                    came in, I never, never conceived that I would be the target of anybody—I mean,
                    after all, I had “diplomatic immunity!” They weren't going to shoot at me. This
                    is, of course, totally different now. That's something else to be
                    considered.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>And, of course, one has to think about the attitude of the spouse or the future
                    spouse, and I think that people should sit down very carefully with their wives
                    or husbands and say, “This is what the Foreign Service is going to entail, and
                    these may be the limitations on your or my career.” Even if you have a tandem
                    couple, I don't think they've still solved the problem of what happens when one
                    of them is eligible to be DCM, because the other one cannot work as a
                    subordinate.</p>
                <p>So there are these problems that didn't exist in my time. But, on the other hand,
                    I would say that if you're interested in foreign affairs and you like languages
                    and you want to be out in the thick of it, I would say, “Go for it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. This has really been
                        interesting. Thank you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CROWLEY: Thank you, Stuart.</p>
