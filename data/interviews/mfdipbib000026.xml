                <p>AMBASSADOR DARYL ARNOLD</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Hank Zivetz </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: November 21, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, I am very pleased that you are able to
                        find time to conduct this interview. Could we first start with some
                        background information on how you became an ambassador and when you first
                        arrived in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Sure, I worked with President Reagan when he was in California and more
                    specifically with Judge Clark. We are both from Ventura County, and Bill Clark
                    was the Secretary of Interior and National Security advisor. Anyway, when he was
                    chief of staff to the governor in California I was very active in politics in
                    agriculture. Judge Clark was also involved in agriculture although he was an
                    attorney. While Reagan was governor I served on many boards for agriculture. I
                    had served under Jerry Ford on the Energy Commission for Agriculture back in
                    Washington. I was deeply involved in agriculture. When Judge Clark went to
                    Washington he asked me if I would serve on an A.I.D. group called BIFAD, (Board
                    of International Food and Agriculture Development) under Peter McPherson, when
                    he was A.I.D. administrator. That group, which I thought was a very worthwhile
                    experience, was to spend about $70 to $80 million. The concept was to try to get
                    foreign countries to learn how to feed themselves instead of the United States
                    having to feed them. We awarded contracts to foreign universities and sent over
                    our agricultural professors to try to teach growing agricultural crops, whether
                    they be fish, or wheat or barley, or what-have-you. It was our responsibility to
                    make sure that the money was being spent for the proper purpose.</p>
                <p>After that, when I was serving on the board President Reagan decided to appoint a
                    commission called “U.S.-Japan Advisory Commission” of which Dave Packard was our
                    chairman; it included Don Rumsfeld, Jim Berek, Jim Hodgson, who had been the
                    ambassador to Japan, along with Doug Fraser of the United Auto Workers. I was
                    asked to serve and represent United States' agriculture. We were to try to solve
                    all the problems between the United States and Japan. As you know, having served
                    in Japan, it was a physical impossibility. The only thing agriculture got were
                    concessions on beef and citrus. I had a very rough time on lumber, and other
                    agricultural products.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Anyway, after I served the president on the U.S.-Japan Advisory Commission I was
                    deeply involved in foreign agricultural trade with the Pacific Rim countries. I
                    spent a considerable amount of time working in the Pacific Rim countries trying
                    to promote agricultural products. I was President of the Western Growers
                    Association, and we represented California and Arizona agricultural interests.
                    We tried to get those markets open. Obviously, Singapore being a wide-open
                    market, was easy. I was proposed to go to Malaysia and you know how those
                    battles go on between career and non-career individuals, one of the finest
                    gentlemen I have ever met, a dear friend of mine John Monjo, went to Malaysia
                    and I went to Singapore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: I arrived in Singapore in April 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In preparation for this interview I did some reading on
                        what was happening in Singapore in that period. You were greeted about a
                        month after you arrived with this so-called “communist plot”. Do you recall
                        that, particularly by those connected with the Catholic church? What was
                        your impression, coming to a country and having this kind of thing
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Well you know, there are problems you get in a foreign country when you
                    have benevolent dictatorships, and that is what Singapore actually is, you can
                    call it anything you want, but out of 81 members of Parliament, 80 are members
                    of his party and there has never has been another individual as prime minister
                    in Singapore except him. It is certainly easier to run a country if you are
                    benevolent. There are things that we disagree with, and one of those is
                    detention without a trial. I had no problems if they arrested people for, in
                    their eyes, communistic infiltration and overthrowing the government, however,
                    in our country they have the right to have a trial. Singapore has, (it is
                    British law), detention without trial and they would never try the people and
                    they would decide when they would let them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not directly related to this case, but we will come back
                        to it; were you there when they PNGed [declared persona non grata] one of
                        our people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Hank Hendrickson. And very honestly, the one problem I had with the State
                    Department, is that they are so fearful that somebody will attack one of their
                    own that they will never accept that maybe they did something wrong. And that
                    was the biggest problem I had in this instance. Certainly not for what Hank was
                    accused of, but in my estimation he certainly went beyond the areas he should
                    have as a diplomat in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Hendrickson a political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the little bit that I got on this was that he
                        addressed a group of attorneys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: What happened was that Hank was very much a liberal in his thinking and
                    he had great dislike for detention without trial, great dislike for limiting the
                    freedom of the press, great dislike for the type of government that was being
                    run in Singapore. In that empathy, he got friendly, and maybe too friendly, with
                    people in opposition parties. He was making statements that were taken way out
                    of context (and I don't want to hand Hank anything he didn't deserve - he was a
                    fine officer) but such as, if he is sitting out and talking to somebody who is
                    complaining about the government and saying “I don't like Lee Kuan Yew” and Hank
                    might have said, “well, why don't you run for office yourself and get involved
                    and get other people involved to try to get a good opposition party going?” And
                    one guy said, “well, we don't have any money” and Hank said, “with people around
                    here, money shouldn't be any problem”. Hank was maybe, and here I say maybe,
                    getting too involved with those people. One of the biggest ones, who was
                    convicted for income tax evasion, was one of the two elected opposition
                    parliamentarians. He got very close to him. The Government was following and
                    possibly taping this one gentleman. And Hank got caught up in this taping, and
                    when it got back to the prime minister, we think, they played this tape back
                    obviously and here is Hank all over the tape talking to this person and , quote
                    “interfering in their internal affairs” unquote. So the Government said.</p>
                <p>Hank never gave a damn about trying to overthrow the government or never got
                    involved in all the accusations they were making against him or offering them
                    money. Hank would never be that type officer, he was way above that, he would
                    have never gotten involved in that. What I am saying is that he went beyond
                    where he should have gone and should not have taken sides between the opposition
                    and the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We don't get that many persona non grata cases and I think
                        it would be interesting for any researcher to follow a case from start to
                        finish.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Let's get to the other side, that's more important. Why did they do this
                    to him? They could have done it as gentlemen, they could have come to me and
                    said “keep him quiet”, they could have done a lot of things. Instead of PNGing
                    him they could have called me and said “we want him out quietly” and I would
                    have gotten him out. That was not the problem. The problem was that I was in
                    Washington with the prime minister at the time, the foreign minister who was
                    very close to our country, was in Italy lining up the next stop for the prime
                    minister. The two people who were left in Singapore were, the first deputy prime
                    minister and the minister of trade and development. Who happened to be the prime
                    minister's son. The prime minister's son was in the original negotiations when
                    we were trying to get intellectual property rights passed in Singapore. He was
                    the negotiator for Singapore and he was asking for additional benefits under
                    GSP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intellectual property rights, the right of authors...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: To try to protect our movies, our tapes, they were copying our tapes, or
                    movies, everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that part of the world they copy everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Right. In Singapore we wanted them to stop copying, and we were
                    insistent. The negotiations were concluded with the prime minister's son. They
                    had GSP privileges and they wanted more tax-free benefits if they were going to
                    pass an Intellectual Property Right Law. We negotiated and settled an agreement
                    that gave them more benefits and they passed the law with the prime minister's
                    son being the key figure. Under that agreement, and I am sure there are two
                    sides to the story, under the GSP agreement, it was stated that either in 1992
                    or when a country reached $8,500 in per capita income, it would no longer be
                    entitled to GSP benefits.</p>
                <p>Well there was a third thing. The president of the United States can cancel those
                    benefits any time he wants to, in addition to 1992 and $8,500, it was a gift we
                    were giving to countries and if he wanted to cancel it, he could. Well in those
                    negotiations it was never brought up that he could cancel them, it was never
                    brought up about 1992 and $8,500, they knew what those provisions were. So we
                    gave them the added benefits, then we got into our big tax problems back in the
                    United States and trying to see where we could get more revenue, how we were
                    going to get more money, and so six months later, not only did they take away
                    the added benefits we had given them, they took them all away. They said “you
                    are now a developed country; we are graduating Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea
                    and Hong Kong”. Well that made this young man, who was 34 years old, irate. And
                    he went after Clayton Yeutter and George Shultz. He went after us because in his
                    estimation we negotiated these benefits to get a law passed knowing that we were
                    going to take the benefits away.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>There is no question in my mind that Clayton Yuetter did not even surmise they
                    were going to do that. If you look at the other side of the picture it seems
                    that we just negotiated to get that law passed. Anyway he was irate. Now then he
                    wants to get back at the United States, he is not necessarily a friend of the
                    United States and he is not an enemy. He looks to Japan as to what they have
                    done, he looks to the Soviet Union, they do business with everybody. When he is
                    mad and the prime minister is overseas and the foreign minister is overseas and
                    he is there in Singapore and he gets this tape of Hank Hendrickson and called my
                    charg� when I was away with the Prime Minister. He said we have got your man and
                    we are going to PNG him. The charg� said, “please wait, have you talked to the
                    prime minister yet, he is with the ambassador. I will get the ambassador back
                    home. Please wait before you go to the press, before you do anything.” I got on
                    an airplane and started back. When I got to Alaska I was called off the plane
                    and was told it was too late. The prime minister's son announced to the press
                    they had PNGed him. The prime minister called me in, but now it had gone too
                    far. All the television went crazy, accused Hank of being a CIA agent, accused
                    him of every bad thing, even to the standpoint that Hendrickson, who had had an
                    illegitimate child when he worked in the Philippines, (his wife, was our
                    economic officer), had adopted this illegitimate, half-Filipino girl, brought
                    her to Singapore as their own, announced over the television, the whole story
                    about Hank and his illegitimate child in the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Washington had asked to see if I could settle the thing down so I went over to
                    the prime minister and said, “Mr. Prime Minister, I can't sit here much longer
                    and take this. You are accusing Hank, you PNGed him and we are going to PNG his
                    equal in Washington, but this thing has got to stop as I am not going to sit
                    here and let you attack my officers. If you say they interfered, you've got to
                    look to me. They work for me and not one of them would do anything without
                    talking to me. You've got to get me. If you want to get somebody you better PNG
                    me, not just Hank.” He said, “Please, just take it easy, this is the second
                    generation coming, the younger leaders who are going to take over Singapore.
                    I've got to give them some space. Please don't say anything for a couple of days
                    and I will see what I can do”. Two days later there was a press conference with
                    this young leader, the prime minister's son, and he said every bad thing he
                    could, even to the standpoint of “they must be guilty, or why aren't they saying
                    something?” I went back to the prime minister and said, “Mr. Prime Minister,
                    I've got to know who is running this country; if you are running it I will
                    listen to you, but if your son is — you asked me not to say anything — so I did
                    not and our country did not, and I advised them of what we were doing and now
                    your son accuses us of being guilty by not speaking out. I don't know how we are
                    going to win this battle.” Finally Parliament met for five days, they never did
                    anything but American-bashing. I went over and saw the foreign minister, who was
                    a good friend of mine and a friend of the United States (there were just the two
                    of us, no officers were with us) and I said “Dhana, I've got to know what is
                    going on here, how this thing is going to be stopped. The United States
                    government is not going to sit here and continue to take this kind of
                    American-bashing. Talking about burning down the embassy, pickets in front of my
                    embassy, accusations of the CIA and the United States government, we can't
                    continue this way.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>He said, “OK, I will get up in front of Parliament and defend the United States”,
                    and so he did. He was berated by some people for defending the United States. So
                    then the prime minister called me on the last day on the phone. He said “Daryl,
                    I want you to come to Parliament tomorrow, and sit in Parliament.” I said, “Mr.
                    Prime Minister, that's putting me in a pretty bad light if I can be singled
                    out”. He said, “No, I am going to speak, I am going to get up and talk and I
                    want you to be there to hear what I say.” Of course I called Washington to say,
                    “What shall I do?” And I got the answer, “You make up your own mind”. [Laughter]
                    They asked if I thought I could trust the prime minister, and I said I did. I
                    think we are close enough friends so that I can trust him. They suggested that I
                    try to talk to him to about not being on television and no questions, but just
                    to sit there. So I told the prime minister that. He sent me over the speech he
                    was going to make and said if there are any problems with it let him know and he
                    will try to correct them. So I went over it and noted a few words we would like
                    to see changed and sent it back.</p>
                <p>I went over to Parliament and he gave the speech. As a benevolent dictator, once
                    he had said “That's enough”, that ended it. The situation was strictly based on
                    his son's dislike for all the things we had done and his desire to get even.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds almost like the “Good guy, Bad guy” routine. I
                        recall, this is digressing, where Khrushchev would create a crisis over
                        Berlin and then months later he would settle the crisis. He was the good
                        guy, people forgetting that he started the whole thing. Similarly here I can
                        see the son having a personal animosity, but why did this continue in the
                        Parliament. It seems almost like it was being orchestrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: You're right, it was to some extent. First of all, I can understand where
                    a son might call a father who was in a foreign country and give only one side of
                    the problem, I want to PNG him and the father saying agreeing to it. I am sure
                    he checked with his father before he took action. That's point one. But number
                    two, they were within four to six months of an election. They practically had
                    replaced every single old-guard leader in the parliament except for the prime
                    minister and he will be stepping down in October, 1990. I think, and this is all
                    conjecture, that the prime minister did not want to step on the second
                    generation of leaders. The prime minister's son felt that they were a third
                    world non-aligned country, and were not going to be dictated to by the United
                    States government. I am not sure that the prime minister still had the power in
                    his hand to stop it that he had had a little earlier. But that is a conjecture.
                    There was certainly a split within the hierarchy of the Peoples' Action Party,
                    no question about it, between the first and second generation leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now in terms of the embassy's relationship with a
                        variety of groups — if you can't call them dissidents, I assume there are
                        semi-opposition voices — how did this incident, this Hendrickson thing,
                        affect the embassy's relationship with other elements in Singapore
                        society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: For about two months it affected it, to the standpoint that I said,
                    “Let's back off, let's try to stay away from those who have been accused and
                    convicted of crimes, whether they did them or not. But let's ease back. But one
                    thing we must do. You must meet with opposition parties, we would not be doing
                    our job if we did not”. So for a period of about two or three months it affected
                    us in getting information from the opposition. It made other embassies nervous
                    too, because they were doing practically the same thing. Consequently, it
                    affected not only the United States embassy there, but also our allies and, of
                    course, it made the Soviet embassy very happy to see them getting down on
                    us.</p>
                <p>Before I left we absolutely went back to doing what we were supposed to be doing,
                    not interfering in internal politics, not getting into agreeing with them, but
                    certainly we were meeting with them and questioning them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another series of incidents occurred and I am curious
                        whether they involved the embassy or not. These were the restrictions on the
                        Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: There are two different stories on them. I could see their point on the
                    Asian Wall Street Journal, I believe in the freedom of the press, but I could
                    see their reasoning. On the Asian Wall Street Journal there were two people who
                    locked horns and neither was going to give. What had happened was that the Asian
                    Wall Street Journal had written about Singapore, about their second stock
                    exchange, complaining about it, wrote quite an article about it. Lee Kuan Yew
                    considers foreign press in Singapore as a privilege and not a right to be there,
                    that is his basic standpoint. And so consequently when they wrote this article,
                    he wrote a letter back to the Asian Wall Street Journal asking that it be
                    printed. It contradicted what the paper had said. The Asian Wall Street Journal
                    refused to print his letter. He said, “Wait a minute, you are talking about
                    freedom of the press, why won't you print my letter?” Our position and my orders
                    were that from the standpoint that the Asian Wall Street Journal is a private
                    periodical that they do not have to print anything they do not want to print, it
                    is not a government newspaper. It is not owned by the government and they do not
                    have to print the letter. Singapore's position was, “if you want to write things
                    about us and you will not print our answers to them, that is not freedom of the
                    press, so we are going to gazette the paper. If you print the letter you can
                    remain.” We were not sure that was the only reason, so I went to the Asian Wall
                    Street Journal and said, “Hey, look at it, I really want to prove whether or not
                    it is just not printing that letter is gazetting you, or whether they don't want
                    you here because you are writing bad things about Singapore?” So I said, “Would
                    you do this, if I can get Lee Kuan Yew to absolutely agree to reinstate you,
                    will you print that letter?” They said, “No, because he attacked the person who
                    wrote the article in the letter.” I said, My God, you guys attack people on a
                    daily basis, that should not be an issue”. Anyway they refused to do it. So they
                    are still out.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Now that is not true of the Economic Review. Davies knew all about this thing
                    with the Wall Street Journal and he was really attacking Singapore, but anytime
                    the government sent a letter he would print it. But he would go after them
                    again. But finally it proved out that it was not the same argument in the
                    Economic Review from the standpoint that he was not going to let them attack
                    Singapore without rebuttal. It was the standpoint that it was a privilege, not a
                    right, to be there. If you want to write about Singapore, stay out of Singapore,
                    and get out of here. But we do not want to say that we don't believe in the
                    freedom of the press, so we will gazette you and we will move you from 10,000
                    down to 400 and you can put your Asian Wall Street Journal and your Economic
                    Review in all the libraries in Singapore. Well then Davies, said, “If you don't
                    want my 10,000 copies you don't want my 400 copies” and he pulled them all
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am curious. Singapore has been called, Singapore Inc.How
                        could it calculatingly offend two of the principle media instruments of big
                        business. Wouldn't this have a chilling effect on people who wanted to
                        invest? Didn't they think about this or didn't this happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: No, it did. They are so self-centered and so overboard on thinking about
                    this little tiny country they feel that “everyone will attack us, everyone will
                    pick on us” that if any item is critical they over react. Anything that happens
                    in Singapore, whether it be a little law suit or something big, whatever it is
                    that might affect Singapore or members of Parliament, they will go to great
                    lengths to respond. It does not make any difference that they are totally
                    dependent on business, obviously they have no natural resources in Singapore,
                    yet we have a two and a half billion dollar trade deficit with them. Sure they
                    are totally dependent on business. And it was not the business people that were
                    involved, the business people were actually more on our side than on theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's project a little bit. In my research, I found that
                        Lee was going to step down. Has he stepped down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: No. He has already announced that this year, in September 1990, he will
                    step down. It has already been determined that Goh Chok Tong, the 1st deputy
                    prime minister, will take over for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whenever a man of this caliber, of this strength, leaves
                        the scene, you can anticipate that things will not go smoothly. Who would
                        you say constitutes the opposition in Singapore? Should there be a reaction
                        to Lee's stepping down, and from which sources would it come?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: The country that concerns them the most is Malaysia. You probably know
                    Malaysia supplies 50% of their water and they were kicked out of Malaysia in
                    1961 — they don't like to say that, but it was done because of the Chinese
                    influence in Singapore their great fear is Malaysia. They keep looking across
                    that causeway. So if the opposition comes up, it will be people of the Malay
                    ancestry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there enough Malays who live in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Fifteen percent of Singaporeans are Malays. And they keep on acting like
                    they are one big happy family, but the Indians, the Malays, and the minorities
                    compared to the Chinese do not quite feel that way. And so the opposition, is
                    made up of Malays and Indians, rather than Chinese is where your opposition
                    might come from, but they really are not organized. Remember they do have a
                    secret ballot election. But if I give you seven days and you do not know when it
                    is going to be held I can have everything prepared beforehand but you will have
                    only seven days to start and finish politicking. You don't stand much of a
                    chance to win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There still are secret ballot elections and people still
                        have a chance to express their desires. But they won 80 of the 81
                        seats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Right, but they only won 64% of the vote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a drop from what they had won before. This
                        brings me to my next question. Singapore is one of the “Four Tigers” -
                        so-called - and they have done very well economically, however, some
                        criticism has been leveled from this country towards some of the others in
                        this quartet, that their increase in economic growth has not been reflected
                        in an increase in living standards on the part of the people. For example,
                        in Taiwan, economic growth has not trickled down enough to influence the way
                        most people live. Now in South Korea, they say, the standard of living has
                        increased. What is the situation in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: They did something that I thought I would like to see us do in this
                    country. They have a thing like our Social Security program, it is a huge
                    retirement program in which Singaporeans put up 25% of their money in retirement
                    and it is matched by the employer by about 10% so that it is 35% that goes into
                    the retirement fund. The prime minister was trying to increase the stature of
                    all the poor people in Singapore, to get them out of the huts and the shacks. He
                    built low-cost, high-rise apartments for the people to move into, but they still
                    could not afford to and could not get into them. So the apartments were all
                    standing empty. So then he said there has to be a way. There was another
                    gentleman, Lim Kim Son, is his name, said, “Look at it, we've got all these
                    empty apartments, we've got all this money to build things with, let's make them
                    into condominiums, let's sell these condominiums to Singaporeans”. They said,
                    “Where are they going to get the money?” He said, “We will loan them the down
                    payment out of their retirement fund, and we will loan them their monthly
                    payments out of the retirement fund. What is the difference when they get to be
                    sixty years old, the retirement age, whether they have more retirement with
                    which to pay rent or whether they have less amount of money but they own free
                    and clear their own living facility?” So all the young people, who never think
                    they will get old and retire anyway, and 25% of their salary is being taken away
                    from them, said “Do you mean I can move into that place, I can own my own home
                    and I will not have to pay, you will use my retirement fund and you will make
                    the payments and if I want to I can rent it out, it will be mine?” The answer
                    was yes. Eight-five percent of all Singaporeans today own their own
                    condominiums, pride of ownership is so high so that now they are taking care of
                    their own property.</p>
                <p>I had employees living with me at my residence who moved their parents to their
                    condominiums that they were buying. It was a marvelous thing to come up with.
                    Can you imagine all the poor people in the United States into Social Security
                    who could use that for housing. It is a heck of an idea.</p>

                <p>ARNOLD: Certainly. The majority of the people support Lee, what they don't like
                    is the dictatorial attitudes they get into in Singapore, but as far as a
                    country, the people are very happy. You can't find poverty, there is no
                    unemployment in Singapore. As I said 85% of the people own houses in
                    Singapore.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy involved in any kind of human rights
                        violations charges? If so, in what respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Obviously we were concerned on the right of trial issue, the detention
                    without a trial business. Even on the drugs situation, they have no drugs in
                    Singapore, but they do it high-handed. If they find you are a pusher or find you
                    with X amount of drugs in your possession they hang you. And if in fact they
                    find you are a user of drugs they will immediately give you a urinalyses, and
                    they will put you into drug rehabilitation without a trial, they will decided
                    when you will get out. You can't do anything about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what form has the embassy become involved in human
                        rights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Obviously we have all the human rights group coming into Singapore. We
                    set up meetings with the Singapore authorities. With one of these men, whose
                    name I can't remember, I tried and the Singapore officials would not meet with
                    him. I finally went over to the Home Development Ministry and was told, “His
                    mind is made up”. I said, “Your mind is made up too, everybody's mind is made
                    up. The only way to change minds is talking to somebody. Sure his mind is made
                    up on the position of human rights, but your's is too. But why do you sit there
                    and not allow these people to sit down and discuss with you the human rights
                    issue even though their minds are made up. It just makes it worse on the United
                    States and harder on everyone and if you are not going to talk to our Human
                    Right Groups we will just take a worse stand against you. What if you sit down
                    and try to discuss the issues and hear why we feel so strongly about it.” Of
                    course we make a human rights report which they get very upset with. But in the
                    area of freedom of the press, or detention without a trial, are major human
                    rights issues in Singapore. On the other hand if human rights goes beyond that
                    they have made a lot of great accomplishments. But you can't condone, in my
                    estimation, the situation. Maybe in some countries we go too far in trying to
                    impose our will on them. But I still think it is the job of embassies to do the
                    will of Congress and the President of the United States, these are things we
                    feel strongly about and had to continue to make it known. In everything we did
                    we always mentioned human rights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another issue, I am not sure you were still there, that
                        may have exacerbated relations between Singapore and the United States was
                        the issue over their refusal to float the Singapore dollar. They refused to
                        lower the Singapore dollar as the United States dollar lowered; they foiled
                        our effort to become more competitive.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Actually that did not become an issue to any degree. Singapore was not a
                    problem, other countries were. Singapore proved that the percentages were not so
                    great. The reason was because when it was the other way around, when we were a
                    very strong dollar, they did not go up to match that dollar the way that South
                    Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan had done. Consequently if you looked at the
                    percentages that they were talking about in the other countries decreasing as
                    the dollar decreased it did not make that much difference. Anyway it did not
                    become quite the issue that it was in other countries. They had matched
                    themselves pretty much to the United States dollar all along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By pegging it to the dollar they eliminated our
                        advantage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: There is also a disadvantage. If the dollar goes down its to our
                    advantage and disadvantage if it goes up. But they were pegged all the way.
                    Anyway it was not a big issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I understand it we were threatening to withdraw
                        preferential trade status. Did we do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: That had already been done. That is what they had taken away totally. It
                    did not make any difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's range a little more freely here. Could you give us

                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Sure. Lee Kuan Yew, a true benevolent dictator, believes in the people,
                    works for the people and for his country. Would do anything for his country.
                    Very much friendly with the United States, very close to the United States. The
                    minister of finance, Richard Hu, very close to the United States, friend of the
                    United States.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Very friendly, we became very close. We would have dinner together. The
                    only ambassadorial residence he had ever been to before since he became prime
                    minister was ours, he came to our residence to have dinner with George
                    Shultz.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: He is an attorney. His wife is still an attorney and still runs a law
                    firm, Lee and Lee with his brother Dennis Lee. Trained in England and was very
                    much involved with the Communist Party when they first took over and saw that
                    that was not for him. That was his first big fight, breaking away from the
                    Communist Party and becoming an independent. He became very anti-Soviet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other parties in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: There are many parties, but no Communist Party anymore. On the ballot
                    there are generally six or seven parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you call Lee's party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Peoples' Action Party - PAP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Peoples' Action Party as I understand it has been in
                        power since the creation of Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Since it became an independent nation. It was part of Malaysia in 1960
                    and 1961, then it became an independent, somewhat independent, until 1965, when
                    it became totally independent. Lee Kuan Yew was the prime minister in 1962 when
                    he fought the Communist Party. At the time when Malaysia kicked Singapore out,
                    Lee's party was under communistic influence, but then he started breaking away
                    from them and it became totally the other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what about the fellow he has pegged to be his
                        successor?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Goh Chok Tong. Remember we have eliminated all the first generation
                    leaders, they are gone. The people he pegged, Tony Tan, who is minister of
                    education - he is the one that Lee Kuan Yew pegged to be his replacement, but he
                    was a first generation leader. He is still minister of education, but he is an
                    older man. Goh Chok Tong is a younger man so they made him first deputy prime
                    minister. I really think they are looking at Lee's son to take over, but he made
                    some mistakes, such as picking on the United States and more importantly he said
                    that no Malay should be high up in the military because they cannot be sure they
                    could trust them in a battle. It made the Malays in Singapore irate; they were
                    Singaporeans. He made too many enemies. He then was minister of trade and
                    development. Gho Chok Tong, first deputy prime minister, very much of a moderate
                    trying to keep the second generation of leaders calmed down. Trying to deal with
                    the first generation. He is kind of a middle of the roader trying to keep both
                    sides happy. I think a pretty good man. He doesn't have the charisma; he doesn't
                    have the speech making ability Lee's son has. Lee's son, who is not pro-United
                    States, is going to keep shoving Goh Chok Tong who is very much of a moderate
                    person trying to keep both sides happy. We would play golf together and I found
                    him to be a friend of the United States.</p>
                <p>The second deputy prime minister Ong Teng Chong, is also head of the union. Even
                    though they say they are unionized it is very difficult to have strikes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the union a government run organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: “Supposedly” it is an independent union, but the head of the union is the
                    second deputy prime minister. Now is that independent or not independent? I
                    don't consider it to be totally independent. But Ong Teng Chong is the second
                    deputy prime minister and is not very powerful in any area. The next one in line
                    and who I think will take over as first deputy prime minister is the prime
                    minister's son. Now Brigadier General Lee who became a brigadier general at the
                    age of thirty-four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a different son?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: No this is the same son I had problems with. He ran for Parliament. The
                    other son is not involved in Parliament - that son, I think, will probably take
                    over as minister of defense. That is when Goh Chok Tong becomes prime minister.
                    If I had to guess, that Lee's son (the brigadier general) will take over as
                    first deputy prime minister which will put him in line in five years or so to
                    push Goh Chok Tong out, but I think he will move up. He is the one I would not
                    consider a friend of the United States. One that would just as soon be close to
                    the Japanese, seeing what they are doing and how they are progressing, they are
                    the most powerful nation, and seeing the United States as dwindling. He takes
                    with him the minister of communications, he takes with him the minister of law,
                    he takes with him the second deputy prime minister, and also the foreign
                    minister, Wong Kan Seng, he takes with him that contingency that element who are
                    not aligned and want to show the United States and everybody else that they
                    should not “mess with us”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This raises another question. When you say “takes with
                        him” and when you are suggesting that the conventional wisdom has the son
                        taking the first deputy prime minister position, who's pulling the strings
                        in the party? Obviously all these decisions are made within the party. Is
                        there an eminence gris, someone behind the throne, someone whose word counts
                        more than the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: Lee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's still Lee after he is retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: He won't be retired. He will be retired as prime minister but he will
                    still maintain senior minister position in the Parliament, he not going to drop
                    out of Parliament, he is not going to drop out of being senior minister, he is
                    going to drop out of being prime minister, so he will still pull the strings.
                    The problem we are into here is that you can take the cabinet and say these
                    people are on one side of an issue and these people are on the other side, they
                    are trying to work things out and Lee Kuan Yew is the one that can make both
                    sides compromise. I fear and feel that when he is not the prime minister and
                    when they feel that he is getting older, that what will happen will be that the
                    group that is following the son will become less and less friendly to the United
                    States. However, I hope that the older parliamentarians will keep them under
                    control until they grow up a bit and recognize the importance of the United
                    States. That is where the problems will be when Lee steps down from his job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another possible problem is the continued viability of
                        their economy. We see that economic strengths change, as we know the old
                        smoke stack industries are no longer as important as they once were. What is
                        the basis of Singapore's economic strength and will they be able to continue
                        that into the 1990's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ARNOLD: Yes, I think they will. The bigger thing is the oil refining business.
                    The Middle East oil, the Indonesian oil, it all comes into Singapore and is
                    refined there. When there was an oil glut they were not refining that affected
                    them, but as long as there is not an oil glut and as long as they can keep on
                    refining they will do well. So that is their number one business. The other
                    thing is, of course, that they have become the second busiest port in the world
                    because most Eastern shipping has to go past Singapore. Their port facilities
                    are increasing rapidly and so they have 100% employment. Many companies would
                    like to get into Singapore to do business but there is no more labor there. They
                    had to make a decision that instead of bringing in day laborers from Malaysia
                    where they have big unemployment they would do without new industries. So they
                    are selecting which industries they want to come in; they will not give tax
                    benefits to businesses they do not want in, and they won't allow smoke stack
                    industries. Every computer outfit is there now, I think, electronics, that is
                    what they are looking for. With 2.6 million people they are educating them very
                    rapidly. They are building new universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is interesting, that recalls something I read about
                        the harsh, terribly harsh, penalties to people who were in the country
                        illegally. They obviously have very strong immigration laws. They do now
                        want to have new people. This does say that there is a limit to their
                        growth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ARNOLD: They are limiting the growth on purpose. They have said “we have had to
                    make a decision to limit our growth or whether we will allow in foreign
                    workers.” As you know, we are concerned about our bases in the Philippines and
                    we are looking for alternate basing sites in the area. We have got to look for
                    new sites. It is a matter of how long we can stay in the Philippines. Our
                    problems in Singapore are not having facilities there, they are that they don't
                    want to have American military people living in Singapore and influencing their

                        maybe in terms of life and morale of the embassy.</hi>

                <p>ARNOLD: As I said before we started taping, I think that the life and morale of
                    the embassy, even though a lot of them don't like political appointees, and I
                    can understand that, there were only one or two people, and not in my embassy,
                    that did not do everything in their power to work with me as the ambassador
                    regardless of where I was from the political point of view. I can honestly say
                    that some of the brightest, hardworking people I have ever met were in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
