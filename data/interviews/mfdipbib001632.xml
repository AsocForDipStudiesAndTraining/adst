                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Mr. Rickert]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Foreign Affairs oral history interview with
                        Jonathan B. Rickert. My name is Raymond Ewing. It's the 17th of December,
                        2002. This interview is being produced under the auspices of the oral
                        history program of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. So,
                        it's good to have this conversation with you and I'm looking forward to
                        talking with you today.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: So am I, thank you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jonathan, I see that you entered the Foreign Service in
                        1963 after your undergraduate education at Princeton University and it looks
                        like maybe some military service. I'm curious howhagot in you interested in
                        the foreign service in the first place and what else did you do before you
                        came into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Oh, thank you. I was born shortly before WWII and grew up in Washington,
                    DC, so I have an early recollection of involvement in international affairs
                    through seeing it in the evening papers for example that would come with the
                    Liebestrom through Europe where the current battle front was and those types of
                    things. Also, my parents: my father was a high school teacher in the District
                    and my mother was a housewife as was common in those years. They had a number of
                    foreign friends who would come to the house, particularly British, but also
                    others who spoke about the war and what was going on in other parts of Europe. I
                    remember an early fascination with maps which I think is common amongst foreign
                    service officers and also foreign stamps and coins. Another thing that I
                    recalled and found in many cases is that the people who were attracted to
                    foreign service are people who are with one another, with somebody on the other
                    side of the hill. There's a certain curiosity involved with beyond the horizon
                    that is common among people who end up in this career. As I was growing up, I
                    was a choirboy at the Washington Cathedral and had the occasion to see various
                    foreign visiting dignitaries. I remember the visitors Queen Elizabeth and Prince
                    Philip in the early '50s, shortly after she became queen. And the visit of Haile
                    Selassie of Ethiopia who presented a Coptic processional cross that is still in
                    use at the cathedral as far as I know.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>One of the most memorable things that happened in the '40s, late '40s, was about
                    1948. It was a time when as a choirboy I was there in the evening for a special
                    service which was to publicize and promote the European recovery program.
                    Secretary of State Marshall and John Foster Dulles were speakers of that service
                    and pictures were being taken of them down in the crypt area below the main
                    level of the cathedral of the full service. And I had heard of Marshall of
                    course. I had not heard of Dulles. I pushed my way forward to get a glimpse of
                    the man who was our top general during WWII. I was grabbed by the photographers
                    and placed in the photograph which was sent around the country by AP wire. My
                    father laughingly called it: “three great Americans.” I still have a letter that
                    I received from Secretary Marshall. I wrote to him afterwards and received a
                    very nice letter in response: a signed photograph and also ... I sent him a copy
                    of the newspaper photograph as well, which he signed in pencil because pencil of
                    course wouldn't run. I have those at home as memorabilia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've done quite a few interviews, I don't think I've ever
                        remember anybody saying they were a choirboy and had an encounter like that
                        with the Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, it's been downhill since then. [laugh]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laugh] Well, it's good to start at the top.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: But ... in high school there werin Washingtothere were several foreign
                    diplomats' sons as well as FSO's [Foreign Service Officer] sons whom I came to
                    know. I roomed with one in college for three years. In fact, two of my roommates
                    became foreign service officers as it turned out. In college I wasn't really
                    focused on foreign service as a career but I was interested in foreign affairs.
                    I majored in American and European history and paid attention to things that
                    were going on in the international arena to the extent that I could. I wrote my
                    thesis on post-war German history: my undergraduate thesis. I had an opportunity
                    to meet with Dean Acheson who was there on a speaking engagement and they set up
                    meetings with people who had thesis topics that were relevant to his particular
                    experience. So I had a half an hour alone with him which was set up by the
                    university which was very nice. Also I remember attending a session that was
                    sort of a career-type of session chaired by Livingston Merchant. I don't know
                    his exact title but he was very high up in the State Department hierarchy. So I
                    graduated from college and I worked for about a year and a half in the U.S. for
                    an internationally oriented private military organization and went in to the
                    military in a reserve's program.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The program that I was in involved a year of studying Russian at Monterrey at the
                    old Army language school. Two of my friends had already passed the foreign
                    service exam and had been told that they would be welcome to join the foreign
                    service but they should do their military obligations first. After talking with
                    them, it just came about eventually that I decided to take the exam which I did
                    in San Francisco; it would have been 1961 or 1962. I took the written exam and
                    passed, went back to San Francisco for Russian, took the oral exam the first
                    time and was interviewed by what seemed to be a panel of economics officers
                    which I definitely was not and I did not pass. I took the written again and
                    passed again ... in those days, if you could pass Russian or another language,
                    you got five extra points which in the second time I took the exam I had enough
                    Russian so I got the extra points on the written. And then at the end of my 16
                    months and 24 days in the Army, I returned to Washington where my mother was
                    living and after a couple of months, took the oral exam, passed it. So that
                    maybe is a long way of saying how I came to enter the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, growing up in Washington and the kind of experiences
                        that you had, of course also Princeton University, you probably were heading
                        toward the foreign service before you even realized it, in a way many others
                        of us only have the haziest idea of what it was all about in the same point
                        of our career. So you entered in 1963 then, after you have the necessary
                        clearances and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. I had clearance in the military, I was in military
                    intelligence which required a lower level of clearance but sped up the clearance
                    process so that I was able to come in rather quickly. I actually started at
                    State in March of 1963 as a GS3 [General Schedule Rank, Civil Service Job] clerk
                    because I was just waiting for my appointment. I was not otherwise employed and
                    a friend of the family was working at State as a civil servant and said: “we're
                    hiring clerks why don't you apply?” which I did. So I had several months of
                    clerical work. I started in an officI don't even remember the name of ibut it
                    was processing new hires and the main thing that I recalled during that office
                    where I was for six weeks or so, was taking finger prints of people. I became
                    rather adept at that and it was a skill that I never used since.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Then I moved to the passport office which was at that point, or the part that I
                    was involved in, was where the credit union later was, sort of underneath the
                    escalators. It was a factory-like operation where a lot of people, typists,
                    typed out names and data on a typewriter which produced a tape and then the tape
                    was put in to a machine called a flexiwriter and the flexiwriter and the
                    passport was inserted; it was like an over sized typewriter and then you pressed
                    the button and it printed out what was on the tape. This was not exactly
                    intellectually stimulating work but it did have its moments and I kept my sanity
                    by reading what was in these passports. One that I recall was a gentleman who
                    had immigrated to the states in the 1920s and for naturalized citizens they had
                    to have their naturalization certification along as part of that application. At
                    the time he became a citizen, he was five feet ten, but by the time he became or
                    was applying for his passport to go visit family in Italy 30 years later he was
                    six feet ten. [chuckle] So I had to check that out and found that it was at
                    typo.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was amusing was to see what women did about hair color
                    because the applications that you would see would say things like “blonde,
                    really brown” and other things indicating ... they didn't know whether they were
                    required to write how they looked or what nature it was given. So it was those
                    things that kept us on our toes a little bit. The other amusing thing, I've
                    never been in an office like that before but the doors were locked while we were
                    there and we had a coffee break in the morning for 15 minutes and a coffee break
                    in the afternoon and no one was allowed to come or go except during those times.
                    It was a real factory environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really could find ... [cough]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: After a few weeks of doing that, I was brought on board in May of 1963
                    as an FSR-8 and was put temporarily in the part of personnel headed by Don
                    Liddell who I crossed paths with many times afterwards and ______ Ester Rice.
                    They were looking at training. They had me look at evaluations that FSOs had
                    done of their long term training to try to determine what the value had been to
                    the employee and to the foreign service. I wrote up a little report on that and
                    that was my morning activity in that particular office. Maybe it presaged a
                    later assignment in PER. Don and Ester were delightful people to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile you were still waiting for a junior officer
                        class or an A100 class to be formed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct and I ended up going in to a class in July 1963. The
                    program was two months in the old Arlington Towers in Rosslyn. We had a class of
                    about 50 half of whom were USIA [United States Information Agency]. Mostly men
                    and all white. So the foreign service has changed very much since then and I
                    think pretty much for the better.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was fairly typical of entry classes in that period,
                        certainly it was true of mine. When you finished the junior officer
                        training, did you do some language training or did you go abroad right away
                        or what happened to you next? Or is there anything you want to say about the
                        training itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, I don't think there is anything particular about the training. The
                    one notable thing that I can recall. One of the few women officers in our class
                    was living in a house in Georgetown where one of her house mates was Mary Jo
                    Kopechne. She later came to a sad end in NantuckeMartha's Vineyard with a car
                    accident with Ted Kennedy. But I met her on a couple of occasions before that
                    accident. Well, actually, not that far before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had no connections with the State Department or
                        foreign services herself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. In those days, group houses were very common in a neighborhood. It
                    tended to always be unisex so it would be a house full of young women and a
                    house full of young men and a lot of them were in Georgetown. The lead officer
                    in my class, Janet Ansorge was her name, was in the house with about five other
                    women from different parts of the government and the private sector. Mary Jo
                    Kopechne was one of the residents of the house.</p>
                <p>When I ended the foreign service, I took the language exam in Russian and I got a
                    3/3+ which meant that I was immediately off language probation. It meant that I
                    wouldn't be assigned overseas because they wanted to send junior officers who
                    were still on language-probation to language training and then to posts where
                    they could polish their language and get off language probation. So I ended up
                    being assigned as my first assignment in the operations center. It was a new
                    office that had been set up under President Kennedy a year or so before in
                    response, as I understood, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and the inability to
                    respond as properly and as fully and correctly as everyone would have liked for
                    the State Department to respond at that time. As a result, the op-center was set
                    up and was in full swing by the time I came on board.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say full swing; 24 hours a day, seven days a

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. It was well staffed and there were foreign service
                    officers and there were civil servants who worked mostly in the day time and
                    there were officers on loan from military who provided that kind of support for
                    meeting State Department staff. I spenit was called a rotational assignmenso the
                    two years I was in Washington as a junior officer before going overseas, was
                    divided in to six month chunks. The first chunk was callewhen I arrived at the
                    op-centea “junior watch officer” but they very quickly changed that title to
                    “associate watch officer.” I did that for six months and worked with FSO named
                    Leojean Marvin who was my boss during that time. I learned a lot of foreign
                    service lore from him. Then I spent six months working in the editor shop, which
                    was part of the op-center. It was one senior officer and junior officer who
                    prepared the daily top secret summary that went to the seventh floor principals.
                    It was kind of a early-warning system for the top people on the seventh floor.
                    The most importanaside from substance relevancwas brevity. It was the most
                    important thing that we had to strive for. I worked with a fellow named John
                    Gwen there, who I also crossed paths with later on. The op-center had some
                    interesting things, of course. I was there at the time of Kennedy's
                    assassination. I wasn't actually on duty at that time.</p>
                <p>I had finished a night shift. I was sleeping at home and woke up in the
                    afternoon. We lived in Cleveland Park near the Washington Cathedral and the
                    central tower had just been completed and the bells installed. And it was the
                    first time I ever heard the bell from the cathedral. It rang in a long, slow,
                    mournful tone and I didn't know where it was. I woke up and went down stairs and
                    my mother and grandmother were downstairs and I said: “What's the cathedral bell
                    ringing for?” And they told me what had happened.</p>
                <p>So we set up one of the early task forces to deal with the very large number of
                    top-level foreign dignitaries who came, including de Gaulle. Everybody who was
                    anyone who came to Washington for that, for the Kennedy funeral in 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were part of one of the task forces or ... you were
                        involved ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: There were masses of people who were trying to sort out the protocol and
                    the arrivals and I was part of one of these task forces. They were set up to
                    work 24 hours a day during the peak periods because the logistics of the whole
                    thing was so difficult. Those of us, like yourself, who have had extensive
                    foreign service experience know that just planning for a senior U.S. government
                    minister, visitor, vice president, president, secretary of state, is a very time
                    consuming thing when you're in an embassy abroad. Well here we had tens of heads
                    of state and government protocol concerns, housing, security, the whole works.
                    Remember that it wasn't known if the assassination was part of a broader plot.
                    There was a lot of concern about the safety of the foreign dignitaries who would
                    be coming. So it was a very, very complex operation. I don't recall anything
                    except for a lot of scurrying and worrying that was going on before this
                    happened and a huge sign of relief when it was all over. There were a couple of
                    other things that happened in the op-center that were of interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Dean Rusk used to drop by from time to time because the best communications on
                    the seventh floor were there at the time. He would come to see things. I
                    remember one case when a fellow officer had just started eating an egg salad
                    sandwich and Dean Rusk came in. The officer got up and put the sandwich down on
                    the desk. Rusk sat down on the desk right on the sandwich and the officer was a
                    little reluctant to tell the Secretary that he had egg salad all over his
                    backside, but that's what had happened.</p>
                <p>Sometimes at night when the bars closed in California, we'd start getting calls
                    from people who were either inebriated or not mentally all there or both. I
                    remember one colleague, a fellow named Hugh Lobit who was senior to me but a
                    mid-level officer, would record, probably illegally, but record these talks. He
                    was a Texan with a very lively sense of humor. He'd string these people along
                    and he would get all sorts of crazy stuff out of them. Hugh incidentally was
                    later killed in Vietnam under the CORDS [Civil Operations and Rural Development
                    Support Program] program and he's on the plaque of our entrance. One of them was
                    a call from a man who said he had a way to solve the Berlin Crisis. Hugh had
                    this all on tape. The man said we should use special gas on the Soviet troops,
                    put them to sleep in the Berlin area, scoop them all up, fly them to the States
                    and wine them and dine them, give them a good time and take them back. Then they
                    would be our friends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [laughter] It'll never be the same.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Hugh would draw them out on this type of nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were working on the morning brief and writing
                        that, what sort of hours would that mean for you? Would you come in at 5:00
                        in the morning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, that was the mid-shift. I can't recall if it was midnight or 1:00
                    but it was midnight to 8:00 or 1:00 to 9:00. There usually wasn't much to do in
                    the first four hours and then things start to come in toward the latter half. So
                    there were periods of boredom and nothing to do and then you had to work like
                    crazy to get it collected, evaluated and written and then approved before it
                    could go forward. During the one year I was thersome very clever fellow did a
                    special one on the 1st of April. It was outlandish but was all done in the
                    proper jargon and it fooled one of the top aides on the seventh floor who was
                    not amused, running in to Under Secretary Ball or some arrangement and saying,
                    “have you seen what's happening?” and showing him that it was an April Fool's
                    joke. We were all sternly admonished not to practice our sense of humor on the
                    top secret report from that point on.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: One other thing I recall was one of my bosses was a fellow named Doyle
                    Martin who told me something that I've never forgotten. Very nice fellow, a
                    little bit of a cynic, but he told me about foreign service assignments and he
                    said, “you have to remember that there are three aspects to every foreign
                    service assignment: the job, the place and the people.” He said: “If you got one
                    out of three, you should be satisfied, if you got two out of three, you should
                    be delighted, if you got three out of three, don't believe it because it isn't
                    true.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That won't last for long, Tom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: [laughter] I had a couple that were three for three but it was a good
                    introduction to the vagaries ... I think a lot of people coming in, think mostly
                    about where they're going rather than the people that we are working with, both
                    Americans and foreigners which is an essential element for any assignment and
                    also what the job will be when you come in. It's all really exciting and you
                    just want to go and do things. But Doyle helped me to focus on the fact that
                    there's more to it than just another place that you'd really like to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. You said this was a rotational arrangement and
                        you mentioned that you rotated after six months in to the editing function,
                        still in the operation center. Did you rotate again or did you ... How long
                        were you actually in the op-center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I was a year in the op-center and then I had two further rotations. The
                    third rotation was the old office of munitions control which at that point was
                    somehow bureaucratically under the seventh floor, so it counted as part of that
                    seventh floor rotation. I worked there for six months. John Darby was the
                    director. Then I worked for a Greek American named Steve Cumonellis who was a
                    very interesting fellow, a philosophy major who had a very philosophical view on
                    life. That was mostly paperwork but it was good introduction. Then I moved on
                    for the last six months to actually working in the front office of the executive
                    secretary. Emory was the executive secretary at that time. I succeeded Ted
                    Russell who had a junior officer position there. It was mostly screening their
                    cables. There were two deputies. Emory and then Herb Thompson, who now lives a
                    block away from me, and a man named John Walsh. I did cable screening and it
                    wasn't terribly taxing from a work point of view, but I got to read a lot of
                    stuff that was very interesting: Overwhelmingly about Vietnam. Vietnam was the
                    issue at that time and I'd say 90% of the cables we got were about Vietnam.
                    EXDIS cables of course, were much more controlled medium of communication in
                    those days then it has become since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So all of this took about two years and so about
                        1965 you were ready to go abroad and use your Russian?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [whispers]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's fine. In October '65, I went on my first assignment to London. In
                    those days, you'd express interest in a geographic area, and then the system in
                    its wisdom, decided where to send you. I had put down as my geographic areas,
                    Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Africa. I had not mentioned the Soviet Union
                    which was a separate geographic area because I was single and I'd never been
                    abroad. Those were two strikeactually, that was three strikefor an assignment
                    for the Soviet Union at that time for security reasons.</p>
                <p>So I was assigned. Actually, they asked me if I like to go to Moscow as staff
                    aide to the Ambassador. I replied, of course, that I'd be delighted to do so and
                    they said, “fine.” Flec Horn selected me for that job based on files. He never
                    interviewed me but I guess he was given a bunch of files and my history and my
                    Russian or something, and selected me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the other thing, of course, was that you had seventh
                        floor, op-center experience. You had certainly learned about the State
                        Department but about the way the government and the national security system
                        was operating in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I hadn't thought of that but it probably was a factor. But what they did
                    was they sent me on a two year assignment to London as a consular officer with
                    the understanding that after the first year, iwell, there was probably going to
                    be a change in ambassadors and then the new ambassador could say whether you or
                    me or someone else who was a staff aide </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: in Moscow. If he had wanted someone else, then I would have stayed on in
                    London and finished the two year consular assignment. In the event I ended up
                    going to Moscow after a year. But I did spend a year doing consular work, mostly
                    consular work in London. David Kirkpatrick Bruce was the ambassador and Phil
                    Kaiser was the DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission]. Stanley Burns was the admin
                    counselor. I worked for about three months in a unit there that was called
                    A-vis. It was a visitor's unit setup under the admin counselor.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I might mention the living arrangements I had in London. Because I expected to be
                    there for a year, I was told that I could go out on the economy and find an
                    apartment and that I had to rent from insured and so forth and so on. For a
                    year, it didn't seem like a very appetizing prospect. Stanley had another aide
                    named Tom Tracy who was also single. There was a new apartment building that the
                    embassy just rented. Stanley had actually rented it at what was considered at
                    Washington the exorbitant rent. But he had straight-lined the rent for ten
                    years. So the embassy was paying a lot for the first couple of years but for the
                    last eight years, it made out like a bandit.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Tom and I were offered a 3 bedroom apartment and it saved the embassy two
                    housing allowances in this new building and it worked out very well. Unusual in
                    the modern foreign service where FSOs would be sharing space in any place other
                    than places like Moscow, the Middle-East or some other very difficult places but
                    it was an arrangement that worked very nicely and was advantageous for both of
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, a lot of people did that in Washington and
                        Georgetown, Arlington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right, but overseas it was unusual, certainly. It was a very interesting
                    experience for me because I've never been abroad before going. I chose
                    deliberately to travel from the United States in second class although we were
                    entitled to first class in those days because I thought I'd meet more
                    interesting people. The anticipation of crossing the Atlantiit was a five day
                    triand getting closer everyday was something that made it that much more
                    enjoyable because it wasn't just getting on a plane and then arriving and
                    getting off the plane and ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... going to work</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Going to work! [laugh] Then I was in a temporary apartment for a while
                    and that's when I was with Tom in the embassy apartment and then we shared this
                    apartment on Abbey Road ... Which was ... right next to the EMI studio which is
                    where the Beatles were doing their recording in those days and anyone who see
                    the Beatles album called Abbey Road, has the Beatles walking across what the
                    Brit call a “zebra crossing.” That was right in front of our apartment. I never
                    saw the Beatles but stay-at-home housewives would see them come and go and in
                    their Volvos, pull up to the EMI studio, get out, go in, make a record and then
                    come out late.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I don't recall exactly, I think it was about three months. Then I think
                    it was decided that since I've been assigned as a consular officer, I ought to
                    do some consular work. I recall Stanley saying, if I really wanted to stay I
                    could do so but, frankly, I wanted to do consular work. I thought that it was
                    something that every FSO should do and I didn't necessarily want to do it for a
                    career but I wanted to have a good introduction to it which I did there in
                    London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mostly visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Mostly visas. I did some IVs [Immigration Visa] and a number of NIVs
                    [Non-Immigration Visa]. I remember at that time Glasgow had closed and a lot of
                    consulates were closing during that time. And Edinburgh was still open but did
                    not issue IVs so Scots who wanted IVs had to come to London. At that time, young
                    women who were going to the States, those nannies, had to get IVs. There weren't
                    other non-immigrant alternatives for them. I remember one Glaswegian who must
                    have been about 18 who came in for an interview. I don't think she'd ever been
                    out of Scotland before; was obviously terrified. I met a number of Scots,
                    educated Scots before and actually quite liked the accent. I asked her questions
                    which she understood, but I couldn't understand a word of what she said back. It
                    was such a Glaswegian dialect or accent that it was incomprehensible so she may
                    have well been a super spy; I finally, in frustration, just gave her the visa.
                    The more I asked her to repeat herself, the more frustrated and ill at ease and
                    nervous she became and obviously it wasn't getting anywhere. I didn't think she
                    was likely to have been a super spy. So I gave her a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just get back to the visitor's unit for a moment.
                        When I went to London in the late '70s, there was a foreign service national
                        deployed running that unit. I think, certainly by then it was an institution
                        and pretty much, as I recall, running it by herself. I'm not sure there were
                        any Americans ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Joan Walton?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Joan Auton.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Auton. Joan Auton. She was there. There was another woman, a British
                    woman, I don't remember her last name. But Joan was already an institution in
                    the early '60s. Indeed, she was what made the visitor's unit work. Many
                    congressmen would come to town that weren't in hotels and she would arrange
                    their hotels and everything that they needed that would make their stay
                    pleasant. She was widely known on the Hill for her ability to get people into
                    hotels and the theater and other events that supposedly had no seats. It was
                    legendary. And she was a very nice and charming person as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else further about your serve in London.
                        Did it turn out being longer than a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, it ended up being a year. There are a couple of other things that
                    might be worth mentioning. One of the things that the embassy did for me which
                    was very helpful and much appreciated was they paid for me to have a Russian
                    tutor a couple of times a week in anticipation of going to Moscow. The woman's
                    name was Lydia North. She was a fascinating woman. She was from St. Petersburg
                    which became Leningrad and had married a Russian officer in what was, more or
                    less, an arranged marriage. She was from a well-to-do family and her parents had
                    told her that they had decided that she should marry this Russian officer. It
                    was already the Soviet period then, but, as you know, the Soviet army kept a lot
                    of the officer corps for a time after the revolutioshe met him. She wasn't
                    forced to marry this guy but she met him and was told that if she didn't want to
                    she didn't have to but she agreed and she said that she had only one condition.
                    And that was that the wedding take place in church. The officer said, “that's
                    fine I can agree to that. But the ceremony has to be at a time and a place of my
                    choosing” because as a Soviet officer, he was not free to walk in to the nearest
                    parish church and have a church wedding.</p>
                <p>Sometime thereafter one night, he came in the winter to her parents' home and
                    said, “please get in to the sleigh we're getting married.” She got in, it was a
                    horse-drawn sleigh, he covered her eyes with a scarf once they got down to the
                    city limits and went some place in to a forest and there was a wooden chapel in
                    the forest, a priest and a witness and they did the ceremony. She then had her
                    eyes covered again and was taken out, so that even if she were tortured, she
                    could not say where she'd been or who was there or anything of that sort. She
                    was happily married to this officer until he was purged in the '30s and then
                    Lydia herself was sent to prison. She had scars on her arms from cigarette burns
                    that had been put to her as part of her interrogation. When things looked very
                    bad during WWII and all hands were needed she was a nurse by training and she
                    was sent to the front, captured by Germans and sent to Germany and never went
                    back. Bua very understandably anti-communist person. She told me before I left
                    for Moscow and she said that she was suffering from some illness and she didn't
                    think she had that long to live but she said, “Jonathan, please bring me some
                    soil from Russia when you come back next time so that it can be put in my
                    coffin.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The first time I went to London, I did take some soil and gave it to her in the
                    hospital and she died a few months after that. But she was a very, very
                    interesting person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And she helped you keep your Russian up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: She was very helpful for that because I studied but I had never really
                    used it. I'd only been trained. And as we all know from language training, if
                    you don't get into a situation where you start using it right a way you'll lose
                    it very quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me just back up on that topic for a second. How long
                        were you in Monterrey for Russian language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It was ten and a half months or something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a full course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It is a full course and then a month of leave. They called it an
                    academic year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had you had some Russian at Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. I had a little German in high school and college and a little Latin
                    but I had not had any Slovak language before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you definitely not had any chance to use the Russian
                        then until you finally went to Moscow.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: So it was lying dormant but Lydia helped keep it alive.</p>
                <p>A couple of other things I mentioned about London; the World Cup took place in
                    1966 which England won. I had not been a fan of soccer before but one of my
                    colleagues in the embassy who grew up in Latin America was a great fan of soccer
                    and educated me and we saw one of the matches. It was great excitement for
                    England to win at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I traveled a lot in England; on the weekends I'd go to places and see things. My
                    mother actually had been to school in England for about three years and two of
                    her old school friends were married to people who were high up in their
                    different fields. They were very kind to receive me and look after me. In one
                    case, one of them was married to the Bishop of Saint Albans which was north of
                    London. He had the position of Lord High Almoner which meant that he was
                    responsible for the Maundy (or Holy) Thursday service at Westminster Abbey the
                    year I was there. The Queen attended where she washed the feet of parishioners
                    and gave out what's called “Maundy money;” small purses of silver coins, very
                    small silver coins that are minted especially for this occasion. The Brits are
                    nothing but wedded to their traditions and Bishop Jones gave me a couple of the
                    coins that he got as part of his cut for being the master of ceremonies for this
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>I was control officethat's a misnomer if there ever was onfor a visit by Ted
                    Kennedy and also one by John Tunney the senator from California who borrowed
                    money from me to pay for a black tie outfit that he needed. He did pay it back.
                    Kennedy was there for the week. I was responsible for keeping him in cars which
                    I had to sign the time sheets for the drivers. [End tape 1, side A]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You were talking about some of the visitors to
                        London and such things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yeah. Another one; I was sent out to the airport to meet John Kenneth
                    Galbraith who was passing through on his way back to Boston. He was no longer
                    Ambassador to India by that time but he had been sent when Prime Minister
                    Shastri died unexpectedly. Galbraith headed the American delegation. He had a
                    stack of exams with him that he had been grading and he left them with me to
                    pouch back becausI don't remember whbut he couldn't take them with him. That was
                    the easiest meet and greet I've ever done because he's about 6'10 ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No trouble finding him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The plane from India; these people got off, a lot of them were medium
                    sized or less and he stuck out, it was not a problem to pick him up at the
                    airport. A lot of us tend to complain from time to time about our salaries. My
                    salary when I came in to the foreign service was $6,000 American dollars and I
                    was making about $7,000 when I was in London. I recall reading in a parish
                    newspaper that they broke out the salary structure for Brits at that time. My
                    seven thousand a year put me in the top five percent of the British wages. I
                    didn't take into account free housing and other benefits. So we had it pretty
                    good considering everything people can find reasons to complain wherever they
                    are. I say that some people, if they ever get to have any more fun, somebody
                    would complain about it. But even as a very junior officer, I was much better
                    paid than the vast majority of British wages.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else about London then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The consular work was interesting. Most of what we did was on British
                    subjects although there was no visa waiver program at that point, a lot of the
                    British people to be issued without review, they were done through travel
                    agencies and other ways. I recall the very first interview I had which was with
                    a single, unemployed, young Englishmen who was going to the United States for an
                    indefinite stay on a visit to stay with a New York antiques dealer, male. I
                    refused but was later overruled by my boss. There were others, a man who was
                    involved in the Profumo scandal at that time was married to an Israeli El Al
                    pilot. She came in for a visa, I had to get it waivered. I didn't handle the
                    case but I saw her sitting there. What was her name? She's a famous woman
                    mystery writer ... Agatha Christie's husband came in for a visa, I remember
                    seeing him. Sir Alec Douglas-Hume came in. I didn't do these visas but I saw
                    these people as they came into the embassy. I was always amused at the British
                    passports at least at that time had “profession.” He still had his passport from
                    the time he had been prime minister and under “profession” it said, “Her
                    Majesty's first minister.” Because the Brits didn't have diplomatic passports at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>I did travel to the Continent, which I never visited before; visiting friends,
                    twice to Paris and twice to Geneva and once to Sweden where a friend of mine was
                    serving in the embassy. Oh, another thing I should mention. As a former
                    Washington Cathedral choir boy, the Washington Cathedral choir came and
                    performed at Westminster Abbey while I was there and I had the great pleasure to
                    see people I knew and attend the service and hear them sing and they did very
                    well. They were up to the proper standard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't ask you to sit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, they didn't. [chuckle] I had been a soprano and was no longer a
                    soprano. So I think those are the ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you had mentioned before that Ambassador Foy Kohler
                        had selected you to be staff aide in Moscow in the Department. The
                        assumption was that he would still be there. Was he there when you finished
                        your tour in London and did you go to that position or did you do something
                        else in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was still there but his departure was already scheduled. So in
                    October of '66. I transferred to Moscow and I had about two weeks with the
                    Kohlers and my predecessor, Richard McCormick and then there was a fairly brief
                    interregnua couple of months, six weeks or sover the Christmas holidays and then
                    Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson came in January of '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were then his staff aide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: So I was his staff aide as you probably know, at that time, and still in
                    one form or another, the Ambassador's staff aide lives in the Ambassador's
                    residence, Spaso House. I lived in what was a two-room apartment on the ground
                    floor where it had previously been the billiard room and an attached bedroom
                    that's been expanded and other facilities had been added since then. But I was
                    very much a member of the family. I had two meals a day with the Ambassador and
                    his wife and three daughternot breakfast, but the other two meals. If they were
                    out, obviously not, but in principle two meals a day for which I paid. We had an
                    arranged schedule, a payment, and I was, in effect, the live-in GSO [General
                    Services Officer] at Spaso House as well as I was responsible for the staff of
                    17 which included three Italians, two Chinese Communists and a bunch of
                    Russians. The Chinese are interesting. They were technically Chinese Communists.
                    These are two gentlemen named Tang and Chin who were brought by journalists as
                    house boys to Moscoan American journalisaround 1940 or so. Then the journalist
                    left and they couldn't go back to China for one reason or another. They both
                    married Russian women and they got employment with the embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the early post-war period or ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, I think during the war. I'm not sure exactly when. They're
                    mentioned by George Kennan. He devotes a page to them in one of the volumes of
                    his memoirs. They were both there when I arrived. But Chin was suffering from
                    terminal cancer and died shortly thereafter. I was responsible for arranging for
                    a burial in the local cemetery. His widow didn't want him to have an autopsy,
                    for reasons which I didn't know, which was standard procedure in Moscow at that
                    time. And it was difficult for the American embassy to request the Soviets not
                    to perform an autopsy on hian officially Chinese Communist. But we did do a
                    diplomatic note, which was the first diplomatic note I ever wrote, which asked
                    on behalf of the former American embassy employee that they not do an autopsy
                    and they didn't require the autopsy.</p>
                <p>The funeraRussian stylthe coffin was placed on a flat bed truck and driven to the
                    cemetery. It was in the winter, it was snowing, it was like something out of a
                    Russian movie. In a very dignified but unceremonious way it was placed in the
                    ground and covered over with no ceremony at all. Near by, I remember there was a
                    Soviet burial taking place with an off-key brass band and long speeches about
                    the comrade and all that he had done for the cause. It wasn't the way I would
                    want it, but that's the way it was done in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in addition to basically being the manager of this
                        household staff and taking care of problems in residences that had occurred,
                        you had other duties too in the chancellery, the embassy, in the
                        ambassador's office or did somebody else do much of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, I did have other duties but Ambassador Thompson didn't use a staff
                    aide the way some other people would. I did a lot of protocol stuff, guest lists
                    and arrangements for events and served as a form of communication with the
                    embassy staff. But on substance, he did not use me directly. As time went oI was
                    there for two yearI kind of latched onto the clerical section and was able to
                    get some additional duties which in those days in Moscow was a lot of reading of
                    the press and reporting of what was in the press and I did some of that. But I
                    didn't do a great deal for Ambassador Thompson other than the things we already
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that in this period there was often a
                        rotation program. I know of officers about this time who went to
                        Oberammergau and then came to Moscow and often they would start in the GSO
                        section and then go in to the political section. So there'd be a rule, sort
                        of an organized rotation. You really didn't do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. I know exactly what you're speaking of and many of my friends and
                    colleagues did that. Usually many of the tours were two yearwell they were
                    virtually all two year tourbut one spent in one section and one in another.
                    There were jobs in admin that were often were the first year. There were jobs in
                    consular that often were the first year. There were two jobs in an unusual
                    section. It's known through all of Moscoit was the publication procuring office.
                    Two FSOs who did that would do it for a year. It was a lot of traveling and
                    somewhat difficult, wearing, work and then move on to the political section or
                    the econ section or some other part of the embassy. So, many of my colleagues
                    and friends did do that. I did not. My job was unusual in almost every respect
                    in comparison to the other jobs that existed at the embassy at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with visitors much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. That was actually one of the most enjoyable things about the job
                    because there were a lot of very interesting people who used to come and many of
                    them stayed in the Spaso House. The most interesting was, of course, Richard
                    Nixon who came and stayed for about five, six days at Spaso House. I had a
                    chance to meet and talk with him which was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time he was out of ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was gearing up for his successful run for the presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '68?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RICKERT: In '67. Well, this was in '67 but he ran in the '68 election.</p>
                <p>There are some interesting things that happened there internationally that are
                    worthy of note. The Soviets decideby everything I could telthat he was a
                    “has-been” and they did not pay any attention to him. He had no official
                    appointments although he asked for them. He asked to meet with his old nemesis
                    Khrushchev of course, that I understand, but that was not permitted. No Soviet
                    official of any standing saw him. As a result, Ambassador Thompson had to try to
                    keep him occupied and he did two things that I recall. One was a reception for
                    the foreign and American press corps at Spaso House which was sort of a press
                    conference. There was a lot of skepticism among the press as to whether Nixon
                    was going to be there.</p>
                <p>After he lost the election for governor in California, then they sent him out to
                    Central Asia for sight seeing. On the trip to various places to raise his
                    profile as an international expert. The Russians were doing nothing to help him.
                    From Moscow, he went to Bucharest. In Bucharest, Nicolae Ceausescu treated him
                    as if he were sitting president. As we'll see later on, that paid off because
                    the first visit that President Nixon made to a Warsaw-Pact country was not to
                    Poland, not to the Soviet Union but to Bucharest, Romania, with consequences
                    that in various ways are still being felt. But I think that the Soviets missed
                    that treating him as an important political figure. They wouldn't have had to
                    give hinot royal treatment buhe was still a significant person and they must
                    have calculated that whatever intention he gave them, whatever they gave him,
                    might assist him in his bid to become president which they didn't want to do.
                    The Romanians bet on a long shot and cashed in big. So that was one.</p>
                <p>Other people who came during that time were McGeorge Bundy and his wife came and
                    stayed at Spaso House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was still ... no longer national security advisor
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. He was ... out. The McNamaras came. Robert and Laura McNamara came
                    and I ended up being his tour guide in Moscow for a couple of days. The
                    Thompsons were away at that time and he had the courtesy of staying and he knew
                    that he was allowed to stay at the residence. George Romney came ... kind of a
                    feeler-bit for his presidential attempt. On the diplomatic side Chip Bohlen came
                    for a visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Former ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>RICKERT: He was former ambassador. I think he was in Paris as ambassador. Of
                    course, Ford Collins was there when I arrived. And Opportune came on a visit. He
                    was the office director. Charles Faire a former diplomat who had lived in Spaso
                    House had been a colleague of Ambassador Thompson's during WWII. Katherine
                    Graham came, Susan Mary Althaus, Martha Schlesinger, Robert Ellsworth he came
                    with Nixon and was later to be ambassador to Brussels and was sort of an aide to
                    Nixon. Carl Kaysen who had been at Kennedy's white house who was then director
                    of the institute for advanced study in Princeton. Sol Hurok came. Lillian
                    Hellman, Dinah Shore and of course, Anatoly Dobrynin came for meals
                    occasionally. Gunnar Jarring, he was the Swedish Ambassador and you probably
                    know from his ... He was one of the early Cyprus mediators under the UN, perhaps
                    the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... and very much involved in the Middle-East also, with
                        the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. He was a very distinguished Swedish Ambassador to Washington. My
                    about-to-become-wife worked for his embassy so I got to know him and his
                    colleagues but that comes a little bit later.</p>
                <p>So there were a lot of interesting people who showed up. In many cases I was
                    involved with taking them sightseeing and showing them around. I spoke Russian
                    and I usually spoke reasonably well and that was one of the little perks of the
                    job. There's one little Sol Hurok story I'd like to tell. He came to lunch one
                    day. He gave his definition of U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges. It's not a
                    correct one but it's amusing anyway and in his definition was the following, he
                    said: “They send us their Jewish violinists from Odessa, we send them our Jewish
                    violinists from Odessa.” He had a nice sense of humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you say about the general state of U.S.-Soviet
                        relations in this period that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>RICKERT: It was difficult because of primarily Vietnam. Llewellyn Thompson had
                    been sent to Moscow, I would have to say by all appearances, somewhat against
                    his will by President Johnson to negotiate an _____ treaty. Thompson was
                    extraordinarily closed-mouthed on that. I knew nothing of what was going on with
                    those negotiations as was appropriate. I had no need to know. But that's what he
                    spent his time doing on those afternoons when he was away from the office. But
                    the cloud of Vietnam hung over everything. And then of course, in August 1968,
                    there was another event in Prague which complicated things from our side. So I
                    wouldn't say that relations were openly hostile, but there was a considerable
                    reserve. I would speculate that the fairly new Soviet leadership which was
                    Kosygin and Brezhnev at that time also was still consolidating itself. There was
                    still some movement and jockeying and being a leader in the Soviet Union was not
                    a job with a guaranteed tenure. So there may be that there was some absorption
                    and seeing where the chips would fall there as well. Eventually Brezhnev ended
                    up being the unchallenged leader and remained so for a number of years but in
                    the late 60s it wasn't quite so clear yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The first DCM was John Guthrie, a very interesting fellow. He was there
                    for the first year. He had been teaching in Japan when WWII broke and spent WWII
                    digging Japanese coal mines and learned Japanese. He was requested by Emory
                    Swank who was there for the second year. They're both very nice and good
                    professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else we should say about your assignment to
                        Moscow from 1966 to 1968. When in '68 did you leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I left in ... oh that would have been in summer of '68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there during the Prague ... difficulties?
                        Prague spring and what followed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. That summer was of course a very uneasy one. In the earlier part of
                    that summer there was great speculation that the Soviets would invade. I
                    remember we had one USIA officer at post of Czech origin named Jaroslav Verner,
                    Jerry Verner who followed all this with great interest and anxiety. Because he
                    had a personal stake, it seemed, in the good things that were happening under
                    Dubcek and was obviously dismayed when things went bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>But, later in the summer it seemed as though the situation had stabilized so the
                    attack on August 21st of '68, came as a surprise. In fact, the evening before, I
                    had met a Swedish diplomat friend and spent the evening playing tennis at the
                    Czechoslovak Embassthey have their own courwith two Czech diplomats and a
                    Swedish friend, Loserich Greendale. Somebody invited me to play doubles and then
                    we went in to the embassy and drank some Czech beer and the two diplomats gave
                    no indication at all that anything untoward was about to happen. But the next
                    morning, or during that night, the tanks rolled and the next morning it was in
                    the press.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of incidents that happened in Russia that were of interest to me
                    at least. Some of them had to do with Ambassador Thompson and I recorded those
                    in a separate memo which I can provide. One of Thompson's daughters told me that
                    she wants to write a book about her father and I collected several pages of
                    recollections of my days with him. I could provide them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I'd suggest that we'd append this to your oral
                        history transcript. I don't think we necessarily need to repeat all of that
                        here if you have it recorded.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I have it written down and I've even added to it occasionally as I
                    recall other things. Memory's a tricky thing and sometimes out of nowhere an
                    incident or an event will pop up; one I've forgotten for a long time. So, it's
                    in my computer and I just added something the other day that I thought of.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of interesting things that happened that didn't involve
                    Ambassador Thompson. I travel a lot in the country, which was a fascinating
                    experience. In those days, you have to get permission from the government organ
                    that was responsible for the caring, feeding and oversight of foreigners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foreigners in general or foreign diplomats?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RICKERT: I suspect ... well, certainly foreign diplomats. Probably there were
                    other branches of the KGB that took care of other foreigners. But in order to
                    travel anywhere: One must recall that from Moscow, there was a 25 mile radius
                    beyond which one couldn't go without permission, except for certain designated
                    routes. One could drive to Leningrad. There was a route south that one could go
                    on for a certain distance, but any other travel had to be approved. The travel
                    plan had to be submitted 48 hours in advance, and they issued the tickets and
                    made the hotel reservations so you could always be sure that you got a room that
                    had electronics. This made a lot of trips impossible. I was in demand for travel
                    because a lot of people did travel and we had to travel in pairs for security
                    reasons. I was single so people often asked me to join in on consular trips and
                    I made a consular trip to Kursk with Bill Farrand. He and I went to Kursk, the
                    site of the greatest tank battle of all time. When two American women were
                    injured in a car accident, this consular officer at the time, went down to
                    provide consular support but he had to have someone to go with him and I was
                    selected. I visited, one way or another, a lot of places.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of concern about attempts to compromise American diplomats by the
                    KGB. The honey-trap was the most famous and much talked abouthe only time that I
                    had an experience with that particular approach. It was in the metropolis of
                    Ufah and there was a publications procurement trip with, probably Bill Price, a
                    very nice fellow ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ... and a wonderful traveling companion. He was the Publications
                    Procurement Officer and I was shot-gun with him. We went to Ufah and we went
                    around and we went to the bookstores and bought things and then we went to the
                    only hotel that was fit for foreigners I suppose; only barely so, and had
                    dinner. We sat down in a big empty dining room with a rather pathetic combo,
                    nothing in front, playing music badly. As we sat there and ordered our dinner,
                    two young Russian guys came over and said, which is common in the Soviewas
                    common in the Soviet Unioanyway, they said, “you mind if we join you?” There
                    were a lot of empty tables. We said no and they sat there and spoke to each
                    other in Russian and we spoke to each other in English and one of them said, “Do
                    you speak Russian?” And we said yes, then the conversation started.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I think they were legit. They were recent university graduates who had been sent
                    to Ufathey're engineerto do some form of national service. They were bored to
                    tears and very curious about the outside world. We talked about all sorts of
                    things: the Kennedy assassination, they were convinced that it was the work of
                    Lyndon Johnson because he was the one who benefited from it so who else could it
                    have been ... and other things of that sort. They wanted to know about the
                    United States. But we were sitting there and talking very amiably and drinking
                    vodka and two young ladies came over and one of them said to me and Bill, they
                    said, “My friend and I have been listening to you and you speak such excellent
                    Russian but we can't tell ... are you Czech or are you Polish?” And we said no,
                    we're Americans. “Oh, _________ ___________ [unintelligible Russian]” They went
                    on and on and we tried to ignore then but they didn't go away. So eventually
                    they said, “could we sit down with you?” One sat next to me and the other next
                    to Bill. We really kind of ignored them in the conversation but one of them
                    sitting next to me, finally leaned over and started whispering and said, “this
                    is such a fascinating conversation, why don't we go to my room and continue it?”
                    I pretended that I didn't understand or hear and then she tried it again and it
                    became impossible not to respond. I had a stroke of vodka-fueled genius and I
                    said to her in terms that she would certainly understand that Bill, who looked a
                    little older than I did, I said: “Do you see that man over there? He's my boss
                    and I can't do anything without his permission.” She made a half-hearted attempt
                    on Bill which got nowhere and that was the end of that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The requirement to travel with another officer, another
                        American was an embassy requirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. That's correct. While we were there, one of our military
                    attach�s who was traveling with his British colleague was drugged and put in a
                    compromising position for photographs and that sort of thing. These things did
                    happen, so it wasn't just some fairy tale. These kinds of things did happen.
                    People did have approaches of varying degrees of seriousness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else we should say about your assignment in

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RICKERT: One of the things I had to do as staff aide was keep track of the
                    provisions in liquid and solid. When I took over the job, the store room in
                    Spaso House I had to make an inventory. Everything in it was sold by Ambassador
                    Kohler to Ambassador Thompson. I found that there were five bottles of rye
                    whiskey there and I didn't know what they were for. Eventually I found out that
                    they had been bought for John Foster Dulles, who drank rye whiskey, when he was
                    Secretary of State. It was expected before the Gary Powers incident, the U2
                    incident, that they'd be coming to Moscow. Someone had gotten the whiskey for
                    him. Why he needed five bottles, I don't know, but I suppose that was just being
                    cautious. But they were still on the inventory and being sold from one
                    ambassador to the other, untouched.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six years after or so. [laugh]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, that's right. They may still be there for all I know. Russia was
                    fascinating. The Seven Day War took place while I was there. I recall walking
                    down the street in Moscow, just as that was going on and hearing someone
                    blasting from a window in June, I think, so it was warm and sunny. They were
                    blasting out the window on the biggest loud speakers that person could muster,
                    it was the theme song from Exodus. Russians that I spoke to at the time said,
                    “Why is it that we always end up backing the scum bags.” Or Russian words to
                    that effect. They were not very fond of Arabs and Muslims and other people that
                    they found themselves aligned with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know of Russian Jews of that period during your

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No I didn't. This was before. Of course in the '60s embassy people kept
                    very close. They had good relations with the outstanding Russian Jewish
                    dissidents. There were a few old friends of the Thompsons who may have been
                    Jewish but that was incidental. They were Russians first, Jewish second, and
                    some of the later ones became Zionists and more open to being willing to declare
                    their Jewish background.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Twice.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He'd been there in WWII. Then he'd been ambassador in the late '50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh this was his second time as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Second tour as ambassador which I think, in part, accounts for the lack
                    of overwhelming enthusiasm in which approached the job. I don't even imply for a
                    moment that he wasn't totally and completely dedicated, but I think if he had
                    his choice he might have been in some place else at that particular stage in his
                    life.</p>
                <p>A couple of other things: Going to Easter services and Christmas services in
                    Zagorsk which was then the head of the Orthodox Church, the name has changed to
                    something else. The cathedrals in Moscow was always very interesting in an
                    officially Atheist country. There was a lot more attachment at least to the
                    outward signs of religion than I would have expected. People said it's only old
                    women but on those occasions you would see quite a range of ages and even of
                    social classes. You saw some people who were clearly not peasants or workers.
                    That struck me. Of course, since 1989, there has been something of a revival of
                    the Orthodox Church in Russia, not to mention the appearance of other churches
                    which existed like Baptist and others but were extremely carefully
                    monitored.</p>
                <p>Going back to the household staff at Moscow for a moment ... The elderly Chinese
                    gentlemen who didn't die who was named Tang had difficulties seeing. When he was
                    outside of Spaso House he wore glasses but he refused to wear them in the house.
                    We asked him why and we said he should wear glasses and he said, “No, only the
                    master can wear glasses in the house.” He knew how to serve and all the things
                    that he needed to dalthough he had been superceded as the senior butler by an
                    Italian named Clemente. One of the best pieces of advice that Dick McCormick
                    gave me before he left was, “Never allow Tang to serve white wine by candle
                    light.” Because he'll miss the glass and I did see that on occasion. The other
                    thing that Tang did was to keep water for mixing in drinks like whiskey and
                    water in gin bottles. But on at least one occasion he mixed up the gin bottle
                    with water and poured a mixture of gin and scotch which wasn't quite well
                    received.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, I think we probably ought to stop at this point,
                        Jonathan. It's about the time that we had agreed on. We'll pick up next time

                <p>We're picking up the oral history interview with Jonathan Rickert at the
                    Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. My name is Raymond Ewing. It's
                    the 26th of September, 2003. Now when we stopped last time, we were just about
                    finished with the assignmenit was your second overseas assignment to the embassy
                    in Moscoyou may not remember exactly everything you said nine months ago but is
                    there everything particularly important that you would want to mention and we'll
                    go on to the following assignment.</p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well thank you, I'm glad to be back and to be picking up where we left
                    off. I don't recall exactly how far we got in to Moscow but the one thing that I
                    need to mention and I believe I did not mention back in December was the fact
                    that I met my wife-to-be in Moscow in January of 1968. We became engaged that
                    summer and married eventually. It's important because the personal aspect of
                    foreign service life is of equal importance to the professional and also because
                    since my wife is from Sweden and was working at the Swedish embassy at the time
                    we met. It's one we'll see through the ensuing chapters of this great saga. I
                    have been to Sweden many times without knowing enough that would make some sense
                    but in any case, we're still married after 35 years which is unfortunately not
                    the case with all of our contemporaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment I see was not to Stockholm but back
                        to Washington in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: At that time when I married my Swedish wife, an “alien” as she was
                    labeled at that point, first of all I had to submit my resignation to the
                    foreign service and I had to apply for permission to marry her. I was told that
                    process would take about a year. The SY (Security Office) at that time did what,
                    in effect, was a full investigation of my wife in Sweden. The security officer
                    told me it would take a year. He said with a leer, “If you have to get married,
                    we can speed it up.” Which didn't strike me as being particularly constructive
                    or a fair way to go about it, but that was what I was told. In any case I left
                    Moscow in December '68. She completed her tour with the Swedish embassy a couple
                    of weeks later in December '68 and returned to Sweden. We spent Christmas with
                    her family in southern Sweden and she went to her foreign ministry to complete
                    her contract that she had signed up for and did not want to break for the
                    opportunity to marry me. I returned to Washington for my next assignment which
                    was the old EURSEwhich was the Soviet and Eastern European exchanges staff. This
                    is an office that has long since disappeared. But during a certain period of the
                    cold war, it was responsible for overseeing, and to some extent controlling, the
                    flow of exchanges back mostly from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The major concern in those days and it was a correct concern, was the purposes
                    for which Soviet and Eastern European scholarwho were overwhelmingly scientists
                    and people who were involved in technology in various areathe purposes for which
                    they were coming. The office was headed at first by Art Wortzel and then by
                    Charles Stefan. The deputy was BurgesTed Burges. Throughout the two years I was
                    there the office was focused on trying to ensure that the exchanges went
                    smoothly but through an inter-agency group conducting necessary checks and
                    balances to make sure that people that were getting here were not KGB or other
                    sorts of agents and were not posing a threat to national security through their
                    field of interest. Some people were rejected just because of their field, others
                    were rejected because of what the agencies had on their background and many
                    others of course came.</p>
                <p>I covered Bulgaria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It was a fairly bureaucratic type
                    of activity. Part of the interest was dealing with the Czechs because this was
                    not long after the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union in the Warsaw
                    Pact. There were a number of Czech scholars in the United StateCzechoslovak
                    scholars, I should sawho wanted to stay at least temporarily because they were
                    not sure what kind of a welcome would await them if they were to return. So I
                    got involved in some of those issues. During my time in that office where my
                    direct boss was Ted Hartry a USIA [United States International Affairs] officer
                    on loan to State, he's also Eastern European ... During that time I was
                    recruited by Mort Abramowitz to go work on the staff of Elliot Richardson. Mort
                    was a little bit surprised upon hearing what the hours would be. Having a nine
                    to five because I was newly married, I wasn't excited with the prospect of
                    working 12 hours a day, six days a week and turned him down. I don't think he's
                    been turned down very often. So I stayed home for the full two years. In my
                    spare time, such as it was, I worked the course work at GW [George Washington
                    University] toward an MA in international relations which in those days the
                    Department paid for; one or two courses a semester, which was a good way to
                    spend my free time.</p>
                <p>My wife and I were married in Sweden on June 20th 1969 and finished out the tour
                    in Washington with assignment being made to Bucharest in the old way, not the
                    FCA way but essentially by EUR. Olaf Grobel was the assignments officer and he
                    asked me if I expressed an interest in Eastern Europe and he said: “How would
                    you like to go to Romania?” And I said, “Don't know much about it, but yeah,
                    sure.” So I ended up being assigned to Romania as a consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get out to Romania, let me ask just a couple of
                        quick questions about the exchangethe Soviet and Eastern European exchanges

                        basically sort of a monitor to make sure that the wrong people didn't come
                        and so on?</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RICKERT: There was, at that time as there is again, a bureau of educational and
                    cultural affairs. They were involved in the programming that functioned that
                    USIA later took over. We coordinate with them about programs and with the
                    various security agencies about background and other things of a security
                    nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact or much contact with the
                        exchangees themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Usually not. The main contact was when there was a problem. We would
                    sometimes have contact with them. Well, the example I gave I think is that there
                    were a number of Czechoslovaks here who didn't want to defect but they didn't
                    want to go back at that particular time. They were seeking to prolong their
                    stays so that they could see how things shook out back home before committing
                    themselves. We were involved with dealing with them and with INS [Immigration
                    and Naturalization Services] and with CA and with others to enable them to
                    extend their stays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much contact did you have with embassies here in
                        Washington? The Czechoslovak or the Bulgarian embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: We did have a fair amount. We were on their guest list for receptions
                    and so forth. They were hunkered-down embassies, both because it was Cold War
                    and Vietnam era and all the rest, also becausand I don't remember the exact
                    timinthere were a number of officials who defected during the lat '60s and early
                    '70s so no one knew quite who could be counted on in the embassies. My
                    observation was that when an embassy was hit by two or three defections they
                    really did hunker down and pull in their horns and limited their contact with
                    outsiders to the bare minimum necessary for getting their work done. We did deal
                    with the geographic desks because we were almost next door to them and we had
                    close coordination with them. They needed to know who was coming in and why and
                    what the problems were. We also dealt, to some extent, with the foreign-student
                    advisors at the universities. Well, they were usually foreign-student offices
                    but they handled the graduate students. Many of these people came on exchange or
                    J-Visas which meant that they had their two year foreign residency requirement
                    after they completed their tour before they could come back as immigrants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about that assignment or should we go on to
                        ... you did language training and then you went to Bucharest.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. I went through language training at FSI [Foreign Services
                    Institute] with the famous Nicholai Kiakov who taught generations of Romanian
                    language students. It was a good experience in the sense that I went through
                    with my future DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] Bob Martins, the econ officer Don
                    DeManti, with admin officer Del Shray and with the consular officer who was my
                    immediate supervisor or bosalthough we were the same grade he was a step above
                    mFrank Tumminia. So we got to know each other and those experiences can
                    sometimes lead to unhappy beginnings but in this case everyone got on very well
                    and it was a good beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went as a consular officer in Bucharest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. After the course, I went to Sweden where my wife had
                    gone a little bit earlier. We picked up a Volvo and drove to Romania which was
                    more of an adventure in those days than it would be today. And we arrived
                    shortly after independence day in July, '71. That was the beginning of the
                    really fascinating chapter. If I add it all up, as it turns out later in my
                    career, I ended up spending seven years in all in Romania and nine years dealing
                    exclusively with Romania and subsequently as a desk officer, then as director
                    for the office which covered Romania another three years, where I spent most of
                    my time in Romania because it was the problem child in that office. So without
                    any design or forethought I ended up spending 12 years of my career doing solely
                    or largely Romania. So starting in July '71 it was the beginning of something
                    that couldn't be foreseen at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it certainly sounds like the Department's investment
                        in you in terms of the Romanian language instruction was very well returned
                        over the years. So what was happening as far as consular work in Romania was
                        concerned when you first got there in July of '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, the section at that time was made up of two full time FSOs and one
                    half-time Vice-Consul who had other duties. We were doing about 2,000 NIVs a
                    year of which a number were chicken feed by today's standards. But a number of
                    them were done on the basis of diplomatic notes which accompanied the passport;
                    either a diplomatic passport or what they called a service passport in Romania,
                    the equivalent of an official passport. Those weren't interviewed but everybody
                    else was interviewed. Then we did a couple of hundreI don't remember exact
                    numbeof immigrant visas a year, mostly immediate family members. It was a good
                    situation for me in that because there weren't that many applicants, one could
                    really interview them. My normal interviews lasted 15 minutes, instead of 15
                    seconds today. They ranged much beyond what was specifically necessary for the
                    visa. Many people came from provinces, places that we could go to but where we
                    weren't likely to spend much time. One could ask about living conditions and
                    availability of food and other things. So it was very useful from that
                    standpoint. Also, linguistically it was very helpful because I barely scraped by
                    with a 3-3 coming out of FSI. But by the end of my tour in Romania I had a 4-4
                    in Romanian and it was largely due to the two years out of the three that I
                    spent doing consular work where I used it all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you encouraged to do some political reporting based
                        on some these conversations you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, we did some reporting and since I hoped and did eventually move to
                    the political section, I picked up odds and ends that the political officer
                    couldn't handle for one reason or another. In those days for those who remember
                    that period, a lot of the reporting done at these Eastern European posts was
                    based on press and media. So some of it involved taking articles and translating
                    them and evaluating them and taking them in context with a comment and I did
                    some of that. I also did ... since immigration was a growing issue and became an
                    even bigger issue with the OSCE Treaty and Helsinki Treaty eventually in 1975,
                    there was a lot of congressional interest and other interest by ethnic groups in
                    the States and so forth. So I did reporting on conditions for applicants for
                    visas. I remember one airgram about difficulties that people told me about in
                    even applying for passports. From the Romanian point of view, the first line of
                    defense was to deny people a passport. Many of the people we spoke to would come
                    in and complain that they couldn't get a passport and wanted our help with that
                    and we had to say as politely as we could that we're in the business of issuing
                    visas and that we don't issue passports. While we feel their pain and understand
                    your frustration, there's not a whole lot that we can do to get your
                    passport.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>I remember doing one report on the excuses that were given to people and the ways
                    in which people bought places in line ... all the things that anyone who has
                    lived in an economy of shortages know. It's the same tricks, same problems and
                    it was a real eye opening for someone coming from a country where if you wanted
                    a passport, you went to the post office or elsewhere and got a form, filled it
                    in and got it as a matter of course. It was a right: there, it was a matter of
                    chicanery and bribery and good luck and a whole bunch of other things that over
                    which the applicant himself or herself really had very little control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do some control in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Fortunately, yes. Our ambassador, the first ambassador there was Len
                    Meeker the former legal advisor in the Department of State who was a career
                    civil servant and was really an excellent ambassador. He worked very hard on his
                    Romanian; used it extensively and was a man of high intellect and very high
                    standards in general. He encouraged everyone to travel for any reason or no
                    reason. As a consequence, one way or another, I visited every city in Romania of
                    a 100,000 people or more, except for one, which I still haven't visited after
                    all these years. Bucharest had, if I recall correctly at that time, a million
                    and a half people. Due to the Communist policy of spreading industry around the
                    country, there were a dozen or more cities with somewhere in the range of
                    100,000 people. This was planned growth. I was able to visit virtually all of
                    them. Of course, most of the travel was done by car, so you got to see a lot in
                    between.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How open was the country for a diplomat, an American
                        diplomat, at this point? Did you feel under surveillance all the time, to
                        what extent could you havsocially or otherwishave contact with the
                        Romanians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It was about as most open during the post-WWII period because Richard
                    Nixon had visited in 1969 and that had been a major event for Romania and for
                    U.S.-Romania relations. There's one little anecdote that if I didn't say it in
                    the Soviet part, I ought to say here because it's important historically.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Nixon came to Moscow in the spring of 1968 as part of his effort to raise his
                    profile as an international statesmen as he prepared to run for the presidency.
                    When he got there, the Soviets ... in effect, he was in the Soviet Union for a
                    week. Virtually no one saw him. He was completely frozen out. He tried to see
                    Khrushchev which of course was turned down. He tried to see luminaries in the
                    current government. Nobody saw him. Ambassador Thompson had to be very creative
                    to find things for a high-powered American former vice president to do. I
                    remember he held a reception for the American and foreign journalists. He held
                    representational dinners with diplomats. He sent him off to central Asia to
                    visit that area. Nixon, by all appearances, bore this very ... well, he didn't
                    complain in my hearing. He stayed at the residence and I was living at the
                    residence. I had several meals with him so I heard him speak. He was very
                    correct about this, but I looked in his memoirs and he hasn't saiI haven't been
                    able to find anything much about ithe fact is, when he became President ... Oh!
                    After he left the Soviet Union he went to Bucharest and he was treated as and
                    this is in 196he was treated like a sitting president. They pulled out all
                    stops, everything the best. Huge crowds, warm reception, everything else. Then
                    when he became president and had a chance to decide where to start his official
                    traveling, it wasn't to Moscow which would have been the logical place, it
                    wasn't to Warsaw, which politically might have been an appropriate place to go.
                    It was to Bucharest: first U.S. president ever to visit. The Romanians never
                    forgot that and always had a very high regard for Nixon because they felt he, in
                    effect, put them on the map and gave them a chance to demonstrate what they
                    wished were true, that they were not under the Soviet thumb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you mentioned that in your third year, you became a
                        political officer in Bucharest, is there anything else that you want to say
                        about the consular two years before we move on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, there were a lot of interesting things that happened. Although
                    access to the consulate was controlled, it was amazing who got through. I think
                    sometimes by design, people who were mentally unstable were allowed to come
                    through. We ended up interviewing people who at first looked to be normal and
                    sensible but the more you talk with them the more you found that they were from
                    other planets. I remember one guy who came in who told me very confidentially
                    that he had a method of launching rockets with psychic power. I said, oh that's
                    very interesting, can you give me any information on it? He said, “Well, I have
                    all of the information and I'm willing to demonstrate it once I reach the United
                    States.” So he wasn't completely crazy. There were others who were being
                    attacked by rays of various sorts who had the authorities putting substances in
                    their bread ... a whole range of these folks. I assumed the consulate was bugged
                    so I can only imagine the securitante there ... the local KBG folks sitting
                    back, listening to the tapes of the poor consulate officers dealing with these
                    well-known local unbalanced people and seeing how we handled them for better or
                    for worse.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>There were also people who wanted help in defecting, in help getting out of the
                    country. I remember one guy who came through who claimed he walked from Russia,
                    he was Russian. He crossed the Prut by swimming and had walked to Bucharest and
                    was going to keep walking until he could cross the Danube in to Yugoslavia and
                    go west. He was a rather Rasputin-like character. I immediately informed the DCM
                    Bob Martins about him and Bob, who had spent time in the Soviet Union and had
                    great sympathy for Russians informalland I'm sure contrary to regulationpassed
                    the hat in the embassy, people put in some money which we gave to this gentleman
                    for his onward journey. He was definitely Russian, how much of the rest of the
                    story was true, no one knows. There were those types of things that were very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting things I did as a consulate officer was interviewing
                    the small number of people who, because of U.S. political pressure or because of
                    family ties or because of successful bribing of the appropriate person were able
                    to get passports and exit visas to immigrate to the States. These people usually
                    had relatives in the States and we would interview them and one question would
                    always be, obviously, are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist
                    Party? Many of them, I'm sure, lied through their teeth and there was no way
                    that we could check it, but a surprising number said, “Yes, I was a member.”
                    There was a system in place for those cases to be referred to Washington for
                    adjudication as to whether or not thewithin the meaning of the lahad been
                    involuntary members. Washington at that time was very liberal with these cases
                    and most of the people who applieactually, all of thewere judged to be
                    involuntary. They claimed that they needed to be party members in order to
                    maintain their job or for education or whatever ... One must remember that the
                    Romanian party was a mass party of about three million in numbers out of the
                    population of 22, 23 million people. There was an open door policy, a lot of
                    people entered voluntarily and a lot of people were sort of swept in.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The most trying case for me, the only one where I knowingly, probably broke the
                    law was a Jewish gentleman. We talked about his background and I asked him if he
                    had been a party member and he told me yes. I asked, why did you join? And he
                    said, “Because I believed.” The only wrong answer. I said, how is that? And he
                    said that his family was from northern Transylvania, which was under Hungarian
                    control during WWII. They had all been sent off to the camps and killed and he
                    was about 18 at the end of the war. He said to him it looked as though there
                    were only two alternatives politically: Communism or Fascism. Fascism had killed
                    his family. Communism promised a better future so he joined the party. He was in
                    the party for two or three years, went to a university and he said he quickly
                    found out that it wasn't what he thought it was. He couldn't fulfill the
                    requirement under the law that he had resigned ... he would have had to have
                    resigned and worked actively against the party in order to qualify as an
                    involuntary member. But he just stopped paying his dues. In Romania and other
                    countries in those days they periodically checked the list of members and those
                    who didn't pay their dues were dropped from the roles and that was that. That
                    was what happened to him. He had never been a party member afterwards. But I was
                    very moved by his story which, if I followed the law precisely and exactly,
                    would have meant that he could not get a visa. I told him that as far as I was
                    concerned he was an involuntary member and I hoped on reaching the United States
                    he would never say anything to the contrary. I concluded that it would be a
                    moral injustice if not a legal one for somebody who told, or appeared to be
                    telling a 100% truth to be kept out, while scores of people who lied through
                    their teeth were allowed in.</p>
                <p>There were others. I remember a woman who was a very simple woman; worked in a
                    sewing factory, a clothing factory. She told me that she was told by her boss,
                    “you're one of the best workers, you have to join.” “But I don't want to join.”
                    “You have to join.” “But I go to church every Sunday.” “It doesn't matter, you
                    can be a church goer and be a party member.” This was out in the provinces some
                    place, so she joined. It seemed to me that she was very clearly an involuntary
                    member. There was another fellow from northern Romania who said he joined. He
                    was married with two kids who all lived in one room. He said that the party
                    recruiter told him that he could get two rooms if he joined the party. He
                    joined, he said, “I'm still in one room.” So there were a lot of things that
                    went on. I think U.S. law at the time might have made very good sense for former
                    Communists from the UK or France or Britain. But it didn't make a lot of sense
                    for former members who are living in totalitarian environments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What extent, did you as consular officer, get involved
                        with American citizens, travelers, residents, or anyone else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RICKERT: I did visas and my colleague did American citizen services. When he was
                    gone I covered for him so I did a few of those cases. But I would say that more
                    than 95% of my work was tied up in visas. We had roughly, if I recall correctly,
                    around 500 dual nationals living in Romania whose parents had immigrated to the
                    States after WWI who were born in the States. Then when the depression came,
                    their parents usually lost their jobs and then returned to Romania in order to
                    survive, really. So they were American-born. We consider them to be U.S.
                    citizens, the Romanians consider them to be Romanian citizens. One of our
                    bi-lateral issues was pursuing the interest of these people in returning to the
                    United States. We did this on periodic lists that we forwarded to the foreign
                    ministry. Usually there was no movement on our list. But occasionally there
                    would be a high level American visitor coming. In Romanian fashion there would
                    be an effort by the Romanians to please the visitor and some names would be
                    approved and they would go off to the States. Unfortunately many of these people
                    didn't speak English. They were American in name and passport, but they had come
                    back as small children or infants so they really knew nothing about the United
                    States and sometimes, I'm afraid, went with really unrealistic expectations as
                    to what they would find when they arrived here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were given American passports, of course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Romanianyou consider them Romanian
                        citizenrecognize that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. In many cases it wasn't a requirement. Many of those who left as
                    immigrants from Romanian either wanted to or were forced to or felt they ought
                    to renounce their Romanian citizenship. There was a method whereby they could
                    pay what was a large fee in those days for such poor people and apply to divest
                    themselves of their Romanian citizenship. They were given a passport document
                    that looked like a regular passport except it had a brown cover and it said:
                    “f?r? cet??enie” for those without citizenshiit's stateless, in other words.
                    Many people who came in for immigrant visas, came in with the brown passport.
                    Others, when they got to the States, would apply to renounce their citizenship,
                    even though we explained that as far as the U.S. was concerned, what citizenship
                    the Romanians considered them to have was irrelevant, particularly once they got
                    to the United States. It could only be relevant if they were ever to return to
                    Romania as a visitor or something like that. That was a little quirk in the work
                    that we had there.</p>

                        general state of Romanian-American relations and Romania's place in Eastern
                        Europe and also as it relates, I suppose, to the Middle East. This was about
                        the time of a major Middle East war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>RICKERT: I mentioned that I arrived in July, 1971. At the time President
                    Ceausescu was traveling in the far east. He went to Beijing and Pyongyang and
                    maybe some other places. By all accounts, since the revolution, people have
                    determined that it was the real turning point in his political development. With
                    hindsight, people have concluded that he was very impressed, especially with
                    what he saw in Pyongyang, North Korea, which was a country on a much closer
                    scale to that of Romania than that of China. He was reputed to have liked the
                    hero-worship of the Korean people, the discipline, the order, the way things
                    worked: I don't know what he was shown, it probably had a turnout of dancers and
                    singers and marchers and ... demonstrators of the controlled Communist variety,
                    not of the uncontrolled American variety. With hindsight we can see that
                    Romania's long slide into more of a repressive internal situation probably did
                    begin after that visit. So it was an important time. We did not see that at that
                    time. There were a few measures taken when he got back. He banned Western rock
                    and roll from the radios and people were a little bit more nervous about
                    contacts for a bit but it kind of blew over and people thought, “well it was
                    just a temporary aberration.” There really was a lot of optimism in the early
                    '70s that things were going to get better and Romania would move more in a
                    Yugoslav direction that anything else. Romania had good relations with
                    Yugoslavia. Tito and Ceausescu got on well; they had similar aspirations in
                    certain ways and similar concerns. So it was disappointing to see over the
                    subsequent years that there was a long slide towards what was probably, after
                    Albania, the most repressive regime in central Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>As you mentioned, I moved to the political section in the summer of '73. Ed
                    Mainland was the supervisory political officer over me. A lot of what we did was
                    working with the press and media to try to discern what was going on inside the
                    country. There was a lot of the Romanian version of Kremlinology, tea leaf
                    reading. Romanian officials were largely available, but not terribly open. You
                    could get meetings and you could talk with them but they really kept very
                    closely to the party line in those respects and who can blame them? One false
                    step and they could find themselves in the outer provinces some place. It's
                    interesting to note that the present President of Romania, Ion Iliescu was a
                    member at the time I arrived, of the political executive bureau, which was the
                    Romanian equivalent of the politburo. He was not, by all accounts, in favor of
                    the Ceausescu line. In Romanian fashion, he wasn't sent off to a prison camp or
                    anything like that, but he was steadily demoted through the '70s and '80s until
                    at the time of the revolution he was heading a publishing house in Bucharest, a
                    scientific publishing house. But he went through provincial party leadership
                    posts and then was dropped from the central committee and gradually got by until
                    he wahe wasn't kicked out of the parthe was, I guess from Ceausescu's point of
                    view, de-fanged as a potential rival. That was another sign in retrospect of the
                    way in which things were going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the junior political officer, were you doing mostly
                        internal domestic things, as you say, particularly, reading the tea leaves
                        and the newspapers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Did that and also a lot of sharing of information with our diplomatic
                    colleagues. Everyone had access to little pieces of the picture. In Communist
                    times, I'm sure not only in Romania but in all of those countries, there were
                    much closer relationships with the friendly embassies, NATO in particular, but
                    also neutrals like Sweden and Switzerland. Often you would find on a particular
                    issue, perhaps the Egyptians or the Japanese or somebody else would be
                    particularly well-informed. One spent a lot of time exchanging information with
                    colleagues. In the case of NATO colleagues, there were regular meetings which we
                    pooled our ignorance and try to turn it in to something that was less than
                    ignorant. Whenever there were visits, and the Romanians did promote visits as
                    part of their effort to increase their independence in foreign policy
                    independence. If anyone came at a high level from any country, it was quite
                    possible that one would pick up tidbits from talking to official dinners or
                    other things with ministers with party officials and so forth. But not at my
                    level. The ambassadors and the senior people would. Those tidbits were shared
                    extensively within these semi-official circles that we had and contributed to
                    the overall analysis.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So what we were trying to do was to figure out in what way Romania was going.
                    That was done through the press and through these personal contacts of one sort
                    or another and also, of course, to influence it. One of the main influences that
                    we had was visits, and there were a number of visits to Romania during my time
                    there. Congress found Romania to be somewhat sexy. Hugh Scott came. he was the
                    Republican Senate leader of the time. Ted Kennedy came. I was his “control
                    officer,” if that misnomer can be used: no one controlled Ted Kennedy. He was
                    accompanied by his foreign policy advisor at the time, Bob Hunter, who
                    eventually became Ambassador to NATO and a fascinating character named Jim King.
                    He was head of personnel in the Carter administration and one of the most
                    interesting political operatives I had ever come across ... There were many
                    others who came. There was a delegation of governors with Dale Bumpers and
                    Marvin Mandel for example. I remember. David Rockefeller came. There were hopes
                    that Romania would open up economically and provide a venue for American
                    investment and Rockefeller came for that purpose. Secretary of State William
                    Rogers came at one point. We had been working on a bi-lateral consular
                    convention with Romanians for a long time. Frank Tumminia, the other consular
                    officer, and I were negotiating this with the head of Romania's consular
                    division, a Mr. Bodesco who was a particularly dour and inflexible gentleman.
                    All the negotiating, by the way, we did in Romania. But we weren't getting very
                    far very fast and we heard one day that Rogers would be coming and he wanted
                    something to sign. So it was determined that the consular convention would be
                    the thing to sign. So State's Legal Bureau, “L”, sent out a lawyer, Phil
                    Shamwell to help us with the negotiations. All of the issues on which we had
                    been told to say “no, no, no” suddenly became “yes, yes, yes” and we quickly
                    came to an agreement on a consular convention which was duly signed during
                    Secretary Rogers' visit. One little aside: I won't toot my horn on this but it
                    was negotiated in Romania and then translated into English. I got the Romanian
                    text the night before it was to be signed and my Romanian was far from perfect,
                    but after it was signed I did find a couple of little mistakes in it which I
                    pointed out to the Romanians and they were embarrassed. Phil said “no, there
                    isn't a mistake” and I insisted, then he said, “well, we accept that the text
                    could be interpreted in the way in which you interpreted it.” So we had to go
                    through the whole ring-a-roll of mending the treaty which involved exchanges of
                    notes and a lot of other things which was a lot of work. It taught me a lesson
                    about reading: not only the large print, but also the fine print. These were not
                    points that would have caused problems in U.S.-Romanian relations but they were
                    in effect, typoslightly worse than typobut they shouldn't have been in a treaty
                    that was going to be considered by a Senate of the United States.</p>

                        Romania was trying to follow at that time. Why don't you talk a little bit
                        more about that, how did that manifest, what did you see of Soviet
                        pressures, the Soviet role in Romania as far as foreign policy was
                        concerned, or anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. The Soviet's had the largest embassy by far and had very good
                    access through Romania. But through a number of means, including those about
                    which we don't discuss, it was clear to the leadership of the embassy at the
                    time that the desire of Romania was to strike an independent direction in
                    foreign polica reasonably independent direction. They weren't trying to get out
                    of the Warsaw Pact or anything like thabut to create for themselves some room
                    for maneuver was genuine. For example, during the 1973 war, the Arab-Israeli
                    war, all of the Eastern Europeans except Romania broke relations with Israel.
                    Romania was the first country and for a long time the only Warsaw-Pact country
                    to have diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. The relations
                    with the United States were conducted in a way which was very different from the
                    way Czechoslovakia or Hungary or even Poland conducted their relations. How much
                    of this was symbolic and superficial and how much was genuine? Scholars of the
                    future will have to say. But it seemed to me even at my low level that this was
                    a possible crack in the Warsaw Pact that the United States government decided
                    that it was worth trying to exploit. Therefore a lot more attention was given to
                    Romania as a country then it would otherwise have garnered as a medium-sized,
                    not terribly important, satellite of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The Soviets, to my mind, were smart enough to apply their pressure for the most
                    part privately. We'd see the indirect signs of it, but we wouldn't see terribly
                    direct signs. I had a theory, which I can't prove, that among the satellites,
                    the Soviets were willing to allow a certain degree of independence in domestic
                    policy, as happened in Hungary with the various loosening up of socialist
                    orthodoxy on the economic side, or foreign policy as happened in Romania, but
                    never both in the same country. Romania, while it was doing a number a things in
                    the foreign policy area, allowing ethnic Germans to immigrate to West Germany,
                    allowing Jews to immigrate to Israel, both done for a price by the way ... these
                    people were in effect bought out. But allowing them to go: which wasn't
                    happening in the other countries. Romania was allowed to get away with these
                    things, while at the same time it was pursuing a very tough and orthodox
                    internal policy. There was no danger of parties arising that would be contrary
                    to the Communist party, or solidarity movements rising, or Charter '77 movements
                    or any of the other kinds of manifestations that eventually occurred in the more
                    western of the central European countries. So, I thinand this is purely
                    opiniothat the Soviets were willing to tolerate a certain amount of independence
                    in the foreign policy field as long as they kept their lid on very tightly
                    domestically which they certainly did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that our approach then, in that context, was
                        to perhaps follow a different policy towards Romania than towards other
                        Eastern European countries to encourage more independence to try to take
                        advantage of it, to try to have more visits ... perhaps to treat Romania
                        differently on the one hand, but on the other, really not take very much
                        interest in their internal situation. The repressive internal: that was not
                        a major issue for us at that time until sometime later, I thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right, not in the early '70s. I think, from my perspective, our
                    focus was on the foreign policy side. Human rights, to my recollection, became a
                    really important matter in U.S. foreign policy with the advent of President
                    Carter. Not that it was missing before then, but Carter was the one who raised
                    it to the top of the agenda in our relations with many countries, including
                    those of Central and Eastern Europe. Before then, of course we talked about our
                    values and we talked about the need for greater freedom and independence and of
                    course, greater movement of people and so forth. But we didn't apply the same
                    pressures on Romania, which is the one that I can speak of from direct
                    experience, as we did later. Part of that was due to of course, to the Helsinki
                    Agreement. We talked about the freedom of movement and that was something that
                    became very important post '75 but it was really, from my perspective, it was
                    Carter who kind of gave that whole basket of issues the prominence that it
                    eventually had. Internally, we watched and we of course raised issues,
                    particularly issues that we learned of: Persecution for religious beliefs or
                    other such things in individual cases. But it was a smaller part of our effort
                    at that time than it became subsequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else you want to say about this first tour
                        in Bucharest, '71 to '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Romanians are cautious but their innate friendliness really overcame a
                    lot of their inhibitions. They wouldn't flaunt it, but they wanted to be
                    friendly with United States and with Americans and with other foreigners. We
                    were able to develop friendships with people in the '70s which have persisted to
                    this time, not with official or government people but with cultural people. We
                    became good friends with Romania's leading painter, a man named Cornelia Bobba
                    who died a few years ago in his '90s and whose widow is still alive in Bucharest
                    and whom I see every time I go there. Another painter who we got to know, he did
                    a portrait of my wife, which we treasure, another painter was ... a man named
                    Yardges Billedon who was not of the same level of painter but was a wonderful
                    human being whom we resumed contact with again after returning later in this
                    saga. They invited us to their homes, which didn't happen in the Soviet Union
                    and was not to happen in Bulgaria when we went there. We developed close
                    relations with a number of the FSNs [Foreign Service Nationals] on a personal
                    level. There were others that we were able to associate with and these people
                    always behaved correctly on political matters. They told us later when we
                    returned later, with a great grin, that they had to report on our meetings,
                    which we knew. But they apologized for doing this and it was the only way that
                    they could maintain contact, which was to provide information on our not very
                    political conversations.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Another thing was the closeness of the diplomatic corps in Bucharest. Not only
                    did we share information together and help each other out professionally in a
                    lot of different ways, but also we socialized to a great extent. There was a lot
                    of creativity that went in to the parties that were given. One, I remember, was
                    held in a cabana up in the mountains. It was a farewell for a very popular
                    British diplomat. About 50 people gathered up there. He was hiking with some
                    friends which led to this place and half of the younger to younger-middle aged
                    diplomatic corps was waiting in the cabana for him and we had a great party
                    there. There were other parties with themes and events; scavenger hunts, which
                    drove the Romanian secret police mad. In fact, we were told after one, we should
                    not engage in such activity because it was disrupting them. People chasing
                    around Bucharest in cars at high speeds at all times of the day and night trying
                    to get ... I don't know what but ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Following clues ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Following clues! So, that was certainly one of the happy memories.
                    Another thing that was really typical of Romania at that time, which was also
                    typical of other countries in the region was the political jokes. The Romanians
                    were very adept at circulating these jokes, even people who probably shouldn't
                    have. But it was one of their outlets. I still remember some of them. In fact,
                    you asked what I did in the political section. One of our periodic airgrams was
                    a collection of political jokes collected from all sections at the embassy and
                    put together in an airgram about once a quarter and sent in. I thought sometimes
                    that I really ought to go to the declassification center and fish these out, I
                    mean, because I know Moscow and other posts did the same and put them in to a
                    publication of some sort because there were little gems there.</p>
                <p>In 1972, Romania and United States ended up as the finalists to the Davis Cup
                    which was played in Bucharest. The match was played on clay which was nothing
                    sinister there. Romanians learn on clay. Americans prefer hard courses. Our
                    Davis Cup team was not delighted with the prospect of playing the Romanians on
                    clay in Bucharest. But we went to a number of the matches and it was an
                    extremely exciting Davis Cup.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Another thing I remember: A journalist used to show up from time to time. In one
                    case, my boss was out, the head of the political section. A rather, not terribly
                    well known, Time magazine reporter named Strobe Talbott appeared. I took him
                    home for lunch to my apartment. We lived in a all-Romanian building on the fifth
                    floor in a one bedroom apartment. It was a nice apartment but the elevator
                    didn't work most of the time which was a bit of a hindrance. But the first thing
                    that Strobe did when he came in was look at my bookcase. I had then, the two
                    volumes of Khrushchev Remembers, which he had translated from the Russian. I
                    remember he remarked on my excellent taste in books. He was based in Belgrade at
                    that time and used to cover the region and came to Bucharest on occasion.
                    Romanians never forget. I remember going with a group of embassy colleagues to
                    Snagov Monastery which was about 30 miles north of Bucharest. It was where the
                    remains of Vlad Tepes: Vlad the Impaler is buried. He is, of course, the model
                    for Dracula, the extensive literature that has ensued from Vlad Tepes. There was
                    a monk at this monastery who was showing us around. It was a ruin but it was
                    looked after by a monk. He showed us a grave or a reputed grave, with great awe
                    and dignity. Someone asked him, “well didn't he impale a lot of people, why do
                    you consider him to be such a hero?” “Oh, he only impaled Turks.”</p>
                <p>So that was good enough for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Chuckle] You mentioned that Leonard Meeker was the
                        ambassador when you were in the consular section in the early period. Was he
                        there throughout your time or did somebody come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was there for two years or a better part of two years. And then Bob
                    Martins became charg� for an extended period close to a year. Then Harry Barnes
                    came, by my recollection, February '74. By his recollection, March '74. But in
                    any case, in the early part of '74. We were together then for three or four
                    months. Harry of course, had been DCM at an earlier time before Meeker. When
                    Nixon had come to Romania and had in fact ended up being Nixon's interpreter
                    because the U.S. government interpreter turned out not to be able to handle the
                    job. So Harry got some well-deserved prominence from that particular incident at
                    that time and still spoke excellent Romanian which he still speaks today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else about Bucharest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, Romania is a beautiful countrwith wonderful mountain landscapes,
                    attractive seashores, rural areas that are still very much 19th century in many
                    respects ... One of the unique treasures of Romania are the monasteries in
                    Moldova which are Orthodox monasteries. They are famous for their frescos. Well,
                    most Orthodox monasteries are famous for their frescos one way or another, but
                    the ones in Moldovand there are many of theare famous because the frescos are
                    not only painted on the inside of the church but also on the external walls.
                    They have been maintained quite well. They used colors, apparently, no one knows
                    exactly ... The blues are supposed to be made from ground-up lapis lazuli and
                    other mineral colors that don't fade. So visiting the monasteries was one of the
                    memorable experiences. My wife and I drove up once with a Swedish DCM and his
                    wife and we, as one could, stayed at the monasteries and ate meals there and
                    then drove around. Although the Romanians had an official anti-religion policy
                    as in any other areas, it was not enforced because the orthodox church was so
                    much a part of their national history and their national culture. Even party
                    members told me in many cases ... I was married in a registry office in
                    Bucharest, but of course I went back to my village for a church wedding. Of
                    course, my children was baptized in the village, never in Bucharest, always in
                    the village. That part of Romanian culture was still very much alive.</p>
                <p>Easter in Romania was something fantastic in the '70s. Church going was
                    discouraged and churches in Bucharest were mainly attended by older people and
                    very young people, children, grandparents and others who didn't have official
                    positions. But at Easter, my wife and I would usually go around, the services
                    start at ten and it would be over after midnight. We would drive around and
                    visit three or four churches and the churches would be packed. One custom that I
                    didn't see in Bulgaria or Russia, it may be a common custom but ... in Romania,
                    at the end of the Easter service, the congregation each member, takes a candle
                    and goes up to the Pascal Candle at the front of the church and lights it. The
                    tradition, in Romania at least, is that if you get home with it, if the candle
                    is still lit it's good luck for the next year. So after the services were over
                    we would be driving around in Bucharest, we'd see trams with people with their
                    candles, people in taxis with their candles. We even saw couples necking on park
                    benches with their candles. As I had written elsewhere, it's impossible to say
                    how religious any country is. But of the Communist countries that I had any
                    association with, and one way or another it was many of them, Romania was more
                    open with its maintenance of Orthodox traditions. Including people crossing
                    themselves when they passed a church on the street and so forth. Probably in
                    Roman Catholic Poland it was on the same level or a higher level. Of the
                    Orthodox countries, there was none other that I saw that degree of maintenance.
                    Or at least many of the outer signs of their Orthodox past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you say anything about in this period, the early
                        '70s, Romania's relationships with its immediate neighbors; Hungary,
                        Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yeah. I was struck by the degree to which Romanians were totally
                    ignorant of Bulgaria. I served later in Bulgaria so I had the chance to see the
                    same phenomenon from the same perspective. I often remarked that Romanians knew
                    a lot more about the U.S. than they knew about Bulgaria and I found out later
                    that the Bulgarians knew a lot more about say, the Federal Republic of Germany
                    than they knew about Romania despite the fact that they were members of the same
                    comicon, Warsaw Pact. The Romanians knew a lot about Hungary and didn't like
                    what they knew. Hungary occupied northern Transylvania during WWII. There was a
                    fear of irredentism. Although Hungarians and Romanians got on perfectly well on
                    a human level, there was always a feeling of unease. Romanians did like the
                    Yugoslavs. They felt they were rather a maverick brethren. In a sense, perhaps,
                    somewhat of an insurance policy for their own maverick tendencies. Then, for the
                    rest of their neighbors, it was the Soviet Union. The longest border was the
                    Soviet Union. I heard in the '90s, when people have asked senior Romanian
                    officials who their best neighbor was, I heard the comment which could equally
                    apply probably to the '70s when I was there the first time. This was the then
                    foreign minister speaking in the early '90s. He thought for a moment and said:
                    “Our best neighbor is the Black Sea.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, what happened when you left Bucharest in
                        '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Spring of '74 I got my next assignment which was to Saigon. I was not
                    happy with the assignment. Not because I was unwilling to go to Vietnam, but my
                    wife's father had just died and my own brother had died and my grandmother had
                    died and there were family issues that meant that anything that far away from
                    either Europe or the United States was going to cause personal hardship. But I
                    returned to Washington with the Saigon assignment still on and took the shots
                    and got the visa and made the preparations prior to going on home leave. The
                    person who was in charge of Vietnam assignments at that time was one Frederick
                    Z. Brown whom I had served with in Moscow. I saw him at the beginning of my time
                    and I saw him just before I left, talking about the assignment he said,
                    “Jonathan, clearly you're not very happy about this assignment.” I said, “you're
                    right, the reasons are personal, not professional. I'd be equally unhappy about
                    going to Hong Kong or Bangkok or Canberra at this particular stage, it's just
                    the wrong place to be this time in my life.” He saias you'll appreciate he's an
                    old personnelishe said, “Jonathan, there's no assignment that can't be broken.”
                    He said, “I know you well enough to know that you're no shirker and you're not
                    just trying to get out of going to Vietnam and if you feel strongly about it, I
                    will break the assignment. I can't say what you're going to get instead of it,
                    but you won't have to go to Vietnam.” I said, “I'm willing to take that chance.”
                    So he broke the assignment and I ended up going off to home leave with no
                    assignment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was towards the end of Saigon ...</hi>

                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. It wouldn't have been a full assignment anyway but I
                    didn't know that at the time, nor did he. So we went on home-leave and while I
                    was on home-leave I was contacted by personnel about the possibility of going
                    off to Vienna to MBFR [Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions] as sort of a staff
                    assistant. To the MBFR delegation, Stan Resor a political appointee, former
                    Secretary of the Army, was the U.S. rep. John Dean was the de facto DCM who made
                    MBFR the latter part of his career. The opening occurred because the incumbent
                    resigned from the foreign service, which to me, less than totally diplomatic,
                    might have been a clue to me as to what was waiting. It was a good place
                    geographically. It was dealing with East-West issues which I was interested in
                    so I happily accepted the assignment and went to Vienna. The U.S. delegation
                    there was a strange bird. It was made up of people from a number of different
                    agencies including several different parts of the Defense Department plus State.
                    There was a PAO [Public Affairs Office] operation. I would guess about
                    two-thirds of the people on the delegation were TDYers [Temporary Duty]. The
                    negotiations took place in sessions in three months or what have you, depending
                    on when Easter, Christmas and summer vacation fell. Then the TDYers would go
                    home, those of us who were assigned permanently would mostly stay on. So it was
                    unlike any other diplomatic organization that I ever had anything to do
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a big operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It was a big operation. As I mentioned, I was called Secretary of the
                    Delegation which meant that we had weekly meetings and sometimes more often, of
                    the ad hoc group which was the NATO representatives, some of them ... a couple
                    had separate delegations, most of them had their bi-lateral ambassador. The
                    Danes were going to have a separate delegation for MBFR. They would meet at
                    least once a week. There would be punnaries with the “other side.” What the U.S.
                    would do would be scripted at these ad hoc group meetings where the U.S. was
                    very much not in control, but took the lead. Anyone reading or hearing this, who
                    knows John Dean will know that they were dealing with a whirlwind of activity
                    and creativity and tactical guile and everything else. He was a hard man to keep
                    up with.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I performed normal staff assistant duties and had thrilling tasks like making up
                    the duty roster which may be one of the popular or unpopular people in the
                    mission depending on how the duty fell. I did a lot of xeroxing, a lot of
                    carrying of these documents. We would take the talking points over in advance of
                    the ad hoc group meetings so that a small representation from the NATO
                    secretariat there would look after them and distribute them. I spent a lot of
                    time in cars going back and forth. The one good thing that came out of it was
                    that I had a little bit of high school and college German but was not at all
                    fluent in the language. I used those long trips back and forth in Vienna to work
                    on my very bad German and make it somewhat less bad and the drivers were more
                    than happy to accommodate me. As time went on, I was able to pick up the really
                    routine and boring tasks that nobody else wanted to do. By the time I left after
                    two years I assumed a fairly large portfolio of very routine reporting but it
                    didn't make life more interesting than it would have been otherwise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the note-taker and the minute-writer for some of
                        these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I did some of that. In addition to the ad hoc group meetings, there were
                    what were called “informals” which were also highly scripted meetings between
                    essentially the U.S. and the Soviets but on the U.S. side, on the NATO side,
                    there would be two other NATO members, perhaps the Canadian and the ____ or
                    something like that. And on the Soviet side it might be a Romanian and then a
                    ____. The ad hoc group approved the talking points that were used for those
                    meetings. So it was very much a scripted event. John Dean personally composed
                    the initial draft of much of that. One of the tasks that I had was to take,
                    after the meeting, Dean would do a reporting cable which was routinely 20 to 30
                    pages long. I often wondered ... his hope was that it would be so long that
                    nobody would read it and he would get things through that might not get through
                    otherwise. One of the ways we did this cable, he dictated much of it. No note
                    taker would go to these meetings of the ... what did I call them ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Informals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Informals, to the informals. He would have ten pages of talking points,
                    double-spaced and he gave them to me and he said, “put them in indirect
                    discourse.” So I had to change the tenses on all the verbs so that they can then
                    go in to the cable: “he said that ...” and so forth. Which wasn't really
                    challenging but it was one of the things I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these talking points in the various formats
                        __________ actually handed over or were they actually talked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No, they were talked. Now, since I was never at the meetings with the
                    “other sides,” it was called. I don't know what exactly happened but they were
                    for oral use. I suppose that there were some non-papers exchanged in the course
                    of this because ... Non-paper, I'm a great believer in non-papers. I think it's
                    a wonderful way to make sure the exact words get to the people who need to have
                    them with complete deniability should it ever be necessary to do so. I've never
                    seen a case where it's been necessary but I made extensive use of non-papers in
                    Romania when I went back as DCM. I'm assuming that this was done but I don't
                    know from personal experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it fair to say, looking back on this period in the
                        mid-'70s that the Mutual Balanced Force Reduction talks were serving a
                        purpose? A larger purpose and there was lots of detail and perhaps it helped
                        understanding between the two sides of what was going on but it didn't
                        amount to much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Oh, I think you're being generous. [laugh] I wasn't privy to all the ins
                    and outs. I know that there were prolongeor I understood that they were
                    prolongeby both sides in order to avoid facing certain other issues that would
                    be inescapable had the talks not been on going and had both sides not been able
                    to point to them and say, “we don't need to deal with this because we're talking
                    about force reduction in central Europe at Vienna.” There was a lot of play
                    acting on both sides, but as an optimistic person I tend to look at the brighter
                    side. One thing, in those days, whenever you're talking with your opponents in a
                    constructive way, even when you're not making progress, I can't see that as
                    entirely a lost effort. This is all the return on the investment but a lot of
                    people from Eastern Europe, including the Soviets, were exposed to what we
                    wanted and why we wanted it and why we thought it was justified and they weren't
                    getting it filtered through Prov Eresdetaire or Abel Agescodelo or some other
                    party paper. That was good. It was an intense atmosphere because, in a way, as
                    it was in Bucharest, as you got to know your diplomatic colleagues very well as
                    in ways that you might not have in many other posts, these were often up and
                    coming people. They're arms control experts from the different countries,
                    they're people who ended up in prominent positions later even when they were
                    relatively junior in the Warsaw Pact delegations at the time. I think that U.S.
                    and the Soviet Union were in the process of figuring out how to make a long term
                    relationship work even when the agreement wasn't possible. In that sense, I
                    think that MBFR talks contributed positively to that. Although I used to comment
                    on if anyone were really serious about getting a result out of these delegations
                    they should have been held in Godthab, Greenland rather than Vienna because in
                    Greenland, there would be a quick agreement or we would have gone all home.
                    Vienna was like being in heaven for many of the Eastern Europeans and they had
                    zero incentive to get the negotiations over successfully or otherwise.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: We didn't suffer so much either. But for the Eastern Europeans, many of
                    them, it was their only chance to spend an extended time in a Western
                    environments and for Americans, Brits and Germans they had other chances.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... still talking about your assignment to Vienna, to the
                        MBFR U.S. delegation from 1974 to '76. You were telling an anecdote, or
                        story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, about Hubert Humphrey. One year, Germy wifand I were invited to the
                    marine ball. One of the marine guards in Vienna had been with us in Romania on a
                    previous tour and was kind enough to invite us. As it turned out, Senator Hubert
                    Humphrey was in town at the time of the ball and was invited to attend and was
                    the guest of honor. A very nervous marine gunnery sergeant had the task of
                    introducing him which he did extremely well, except he introduced him as the
                    former president of the United States and there was a gasp and chitters, but
                    Humphrey, I don't remember exactly how he did it but he defused that with such
                    grace and such humanity and such kindness that what could have been a great
                    embarrassment for the gunny, ended up being a plus. He complimented the gunny on
                    his perspicacity and said, “You and my mother are the only two people who really
                    saw it as it should have been” or something along those lines. It was very nice,
                    he put the pressure on himself and took it off the gunny, which I thought showed
                    great humanity.</p>
                <p>Another thing out of Vienna that was a sideline but very enjoyable for me was ...
                    I was called back to Bucharest twice on TDYs because they had a shortage in the
                    consular section. I was a Romanian-speaking consular officer an hour and a half
                    away so I went back for a week one time and two weeks another time which was a
                    great pleasure. The second time, as a bonus for having done the consular work, I
                    was allowed to stay for the visit of President Ford which was the first time
                    I've ever seen a presidential and it was a fascinating experience. Ford had just
                    come from Helsinki where he had signed the Helsinki accords. I wasn't involved
                    much in the substance of his visit but I got very much involved in the logistics
                    and was an event officer for a stop at the military academy. I got to see the
                    whole machinery of presidential visits. Henry Kissinger was there, and they went
                    off to Sinaia, which is the summer palace of the former royal family which is
                    one of the architectural delights and curiosities of Romania: late 19th century
                    Bavarian palace, a big castle, in the tradition of Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria.
                    Of course the Romanian royal family was German and it was recreated there and
                    the Carpathians took right in.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I also learned to ski while we were in Vienna, which was a great delight. Another
                    minor Romanian connection was all three consular FSNs came to Vienna during the
                    time that I was there. One by one they were let out for “hoped up trainings” ...
                    it was a little benefit that we had for them. One of them, who was single, asked
                    my wife if she should defect while she was out which was one that my wife very
                    carefully sidestepped. There was obviously a strong temptation not to go back.
                    The woman did eventually go back, marry the Pan-Am rep and now is living in
                    Connecticut. The other two came out and it was a delight to see them outside of
                    their Romanian environment and to be able to do something for them. Each one, we
                    took to a concert or the opera or a ballet or something and took them out to
                    dinner and did things with them which was a great pleasure.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of my tour there, I would have ended up being three years doing
                    the same thing, which was too much of a good thing. We love Vienna, it's a
                    delightful place to live. Gerd, my wife, had gotten herself a job at UNIDO
                    [United Nations Industrial Development Organization] as a secretary and was very
                    happy with her work. But we both agreed it was time to move on, so I asked to
                    curtail. I was told that I couldn't curtail unless I was willing to accept to go
                    someplace where there was a service need and I asked where that might be and was
                    told that there was a shortage of labor officers. If I would agree to undergo
                    labor training, which meant the terrible suffering of a year at Harvard at that
                    time, then go to some place unknown, personnel could curtail my tour. So I did
                    accept that offer. Harvard sounded wonderful and I wasn't going to worry about
                    what happened beyond that. So we left after two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had a year at Cambridge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ... and had a year at Cambridge, which was a wonderful experience. The
                    labor training program was a year at Harvard. Fall semester was spent at the
                    Kennedy school, essentially doing whatever you wanted. The Spring semester was
                    in something called the Harvard Trade Union Program which was sponsored by the
                    AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations].
                    It was linked unofficially with the Harvard Business School. It wasn't part of
                    the business school but it was for trade unionists, American trade unionists and
                    some foreign trade unionists. It was a much less academic program but a good
                    introduction to a history of labor, concerns of training and movement, how it's
                    organized, issues and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The semester at the county school of government allowed
                        you to take courses there but also elsewhere in the University?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. Anything at Harvard University was fair game. I ended up
                    taking four courses. The first was ethnicity and politics taught by Daniel
                    Patrick Moynihan in his last semester at Harvard. He was running for Senate at
                    the time. But he did show up for every class. He wasn't terribly concerned about
                    his opposition in New York. The next was called “U.S. Diplomacy Since WWII”
                    taught by Stanley Hoffman, also a well known name. I took a course called
                    “European Diplomatic History Since 1815,” taught by Earnest May, another star of
                    the Harvard faculty. Those were all outside the Kennedy School and then there
                    was one seminar that was done in the Kennedy School, which Graham Alison chaired
                    called “Ethical Problems in Public Careers.” At that time there was a large
                    number of U.S. government people sent to Harvard for mostly MPAs, a master in
                    public administration. There were folks from Capitol Hill, there were folks from
                    many different U.S. government agencies and that was one of the courses that
                    they could take, an excellent course.</p>
                <p>The one I enjoyed the most was Moynihan's. The main task was to write a seminar
                    paper, 40-50 pages. We had to submit to him our proposals and I had two or three
                    proposals on minority issues in the Soviet Union and then I said, “or I could do
                    something on minorities in Romania.” When I met with him he said, “oh
                    everybody's writing on minorities in the Soviet Union, I hadn't seen anything on
                    Romania recently.” Then he asked me a little bit on my background and I told
                    him. He said, “oh, that'll make a good topic.” So, I did write on Romania. He
                    gave me an A+ on the paper which I'm proud of. It was hard work but it was a
                    great deal of enjoyment pulling it together. I wrote on the policy of the
                    Romanian government towards ethnic minorities from the onset of Communism until
                    1976 when I was there, with a focus on ethnic Hungarians, Roma-Gypsies, Jews and
                    Germans. It was a very interesting and enjoyable project. The hardest part of it
                    was the Roma-Gypsies because there was almost nothing in writing in the Harvard
                    library or in the Library of Congress that I could find. The Romanians made no
                    mention of this ethnic group in any public statements and there was very little
                    available. But for a seminar paper, there was enough and I knew enough myself to
                    be able to cover it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did you get a master's degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No. We had to do both semesters and I couldn't do the second semester.
                    By the time we had arrived ... well, before we arrived in Cambridge we found
                    that Gerd was pregnant with our first child who was born in Boston in February
                    of 1977. That was one big event in our lives. The other was buying our first
                    house in Washington: our first and last house in Washington which we bought
                    during the Summer just before going down there and did the closing in the Fall.
                    I flew down from Boston to close. I mention it because it has a little bit of an
                    interesting history. The house that we bought, the seller was George F. Will. It
                    was his starter house. It was our starter and finisher house. It was the house
                    that he bought and lived in before he was rich and famous. He moved to a house
                    in Chevy Chase that cost, I know, three and half times what we paid for ours.
                    Then he put in another good chunk of change before moving in, so he really moved
                    up. Two interesting tidbits about the housof course we weren't going to be
                    living in it at least at firsso we put it on the rental market. Our first tenant
                    ended up being Stuart Eisenstadt. He was just arriving from Georgia to take up
                    his position as Domestic Policy Advisor to President Carter and he rented it for
                    two years obviously, while we had the intention of looking for a more permanent
                    and probably more appropriate conditions. He broke the lease after a year and
                    found somebody else to take it at slightly higher rent so we were entirely
                    pleased with him as a tenant and it was no problem. What's interesting is the
                    people who have lived in it in terms of prominence have gone downhill
                    substantially since Stu moved out.</p>
                <p>The other little tidbit about the house that we learned from neighbors was that
                    while George Will lived there and before he became President, Ronald Reagan had
                    been there for dinner. There's no plaque on the dinning room any place but I
                    don't know when exactly that took place. We sit in the dining room sometimes and
                    wonder what Ronald Reagan had for dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else about the year in Cambridge and if not
                        maybe we should stop pretty soon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: A couple of other little things. In addition to the four courses that I
                    took in the Fall Semester, I audited the beginning Swedish which has turned out
                    to be a great help in my personal family life with relatives who don't speak
                    English in some cases. One of the shocking events that occurred waour ritual in
                    the evenings was to watch the seven o'clock news before I would get down to worI
                    remember in March of 1977 seeing the lead story being the giant earthquake in
                    Bucharest with scenes of Boulevard of Magero two blocks from the embassy of the
                    main drag, with many of the wings collapsed and over a thousand people known
                    dead. It was totally unexpected and one always knows in Romania, in any
                    geographic area you could have an earthquake at any time, but there hadn't been
                    a big one for many years. Seeing familiar haunts as rubble was a shock and
                    wondering what had happened to people, no one that I knew personally was killed
                    in the quake, but a number of prominent actors and artists and others were
                    because their apartments were in that area.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>As a small after thought to that or moving ahead to that earthquake: a good
                    friend and colleague of mine who was at the embassy at the time, Clark Rogers,
                    was the admin officer. After the earthquake he was surveying embassy grounds and
                    some of the bits of the facade of the embassy had fallen off although the
                    building itself had not been structurally damaged. One of the bits was a cement
                    head of a ram which had been a decorative piece. It's an old building 1890s or
                    so. A workman was scooping this up to throw it in to a dump truck and Clark
                    said, “What are you doing with that?” and they said, “We're taking it to the
                    dump” and he said “Can I have it?” and they said, “Sure, it's going to the dump,
                    there's no reason you shouldn't have it.” He lugged it around for the rest of
                    his career. After he retired, Clark and Gussy were neighbors of ours two, three
                    houses down, they finally moved from Washington to Atlanta, before going, Clark,
                    possibly under urging from Gussy, asked if we would like to have the ram. We
                    ended up with it, not knowing what to do with it, two years ago when we built a
                    little addition to our house, we found a nice spot in our new brick wall where
                    the ram now proudly sits as a permanent reminder of Romania and our time
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, why don't we stop now. Your next assignment
                        was to Trinidad and we'll talk about that next time we get together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I'd be happy to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... 24th of November, 2003 and we're picking up this
                        interview after an interval of about two months. Jonathan, I think we're
                        about ready to get you assigned to the embassy in Trinidad, Embassy Port of
                        Spain as political labor officer. It seems to nicely follow your year of
                        labor training at Harvard. Is that a correct assessment, assumption? Tell me
                        about that assignment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, in fact, under that program it was a requirement when we go in to a
                    labor designated position, following that year of labor training at Harvard.
                    Among the list of countries that were available to be bid on, Trinidad was my
                    second choice but one that I was very happy to get. My wife and daughter and I
                    transferred there in July of 1977. It was a small embassy which if I recall
                    correctly had under 15 Americans, it had State element and had a two person USIA
                    element. The ambassador was Richard Fox, a career fellow who was followed by
                    Irving Cheslaw, also a career officer. I was the sole political officer. There
                    was a one person, Econ-Commercial section and we were located right next to each
                    other and when she was on leave I covered for her and vice versa so it was a
                    very cozy arrangement. Obviously, as it could be expected, the biggest section
                    by far was the consular section with a number of junior officers earning their
                    spurs in Port of Spain for their first tour as consular officers.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Trinidad was a small but unusual country. It's the only tour I had in my career
                    outside of the EUR and it's one that I'm very grateful for because it brought a
                    different perspective to my work and to my experience from anything I have had
                    elsewhere or would have subsequently. The country was about 60 miles long and 30
                    miles wide, that is Trinidad itself and Tobago was smaller, 18 miles away if I
                    recall correctly. It was a country that in the 70s was enjoying a bit of a boom
                    due to the presence of oil and gas in not huge quantities but for a small
                    country, you didn't need all that much to make a real impact on the economy. 1.2
                    million people: a very interesting ethnic mix of Indians from India and black
                    people and black people mixed with other races, fairly evenly divided and then a
                    fairly small white and what they call Lebanese-Syrians and some Asians there. It
                    was quite an interesting microcosm for inter-ethnic relations in a country that
                    celebrated Hindu, Muslim and Christian holidays. One of the things that I noted
                    about the Christian section of the population was that it ranged from very high
                    church traditional Anglo and Roman Catholic to what one could call
                    “voodoo-Baptist” with heavy doses of African influence and everything in
                    between. So it was much more variety and a lot more surprises that one wouldn't
                    expect in such a small country. The prime minister, when I got there, was Eric
                    Williams who was the leader of the Trinidad independence movement, a very
                    brilliant man who had been a professor at Howard University but a very strange
                    man. He, shortly after I arrived and I don't think there's any connection,
                    declined to meet with American officials for the rest of his life actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, he had some problems in the United States: Legal problems, the
                    exact nature of which I no longer recall. He was somebody who never forgot a
                    slight or an insult and that's the best explanation that I can give. I'm sure
                    since he was an extremely complex person it was a lot more complex that. He had
                    a daughter who was living in Miami but the fact is that he avoided all
                    Americans. Interestingly, I was there for three years and we had zero CODELs in
                    three years. We had one Democratic congressman from California, a man named
                    Mervyn Dymally who was born in Trinidad. He used to come down from time to time,
                    ask for no service at all from the embassy and he would meet with Eric Williams
                    but the Ambassador of the United States did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Williams asked that his minister and others in the ...
                        also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a personal thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>RICKERT: It apparently was a personal thing. Other ministers would call me
                    directly. It's a small country so you got to know most people very quickly even
                    as a second secretary. You were on a first name basis with a lot people in a
                    small place like that. Ministers would call and ask for help with visas and
                    things: some of them do-able, some of them not. It wasn't a situation where the
                    rest of the government was inhibited from meeting and contacting anybody in the
                    embassy. But the Ambassador of course had much broader contacts. I covered the
                    trade unions and the opposition which was mostly Indian although there was one
                    small Tobago-based party headed by Arthur Raymond Napoleon Robinson, “A.N.R.” as
                    he was known, who was very black. Tobago is not mixed, really. It is essentially
                    a black island and when you go there the people show very little evidence of
                    having mixed with other races and there are very few non-blacks living on that
                    island so it really is kind of a distinct unit compared with Trinidad which is
                    much more cosmopolitan.</p>
                <p>A couple of observations about Trinidad: As it was a small embassy, one thing I
                    learned is small embassies can either be wonderful experiences or quite the
                    opposite. When I arrived there had been an ambassador, a political appointee,
                    who apparently didn't like people of color. His DCM, who was a very able fellow
                    who later became an ambassador, didn't have enough to do, so he did everybody
                    else's jobs for them which was not exactly a morale builder. This was the way it
                    was related to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was before your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Before my time. I arrived about two weeks after both of them had left
                    and found an unhappy and demoralized group of people by and large. Within a
                    period of a relatively few weeks with a new ambassador and new DCM it changed
                    very quickly and was, I would say, a relatively happy and productive
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Fox was the new ambassador? Who came about the
                        same time you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the new DCM was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>RICKERT: A fellow named Michael Yohn who had served in the Office of Caribbean
                    Affairs previously and had a fair amount of ARA experience. The rest of the
                    embassy, I don't remember the names but John Adams was consul-general and that
                    was a big job in Trinidad. A fellow named Reese Louise was admin officer. A lot
                    of very good officers got their start in Trinidad. Lou Dent was a junior officer
                    there when I got there; he's one of the top folks in admin these days. I've come
                    across a number of others over the years. Kathy Stephens who is now the EUR
                    ambassador for the Balkans who came while I was there. A young woman, Denise
                    Mathieu who was an ambassador in Africa someplace was a junior officer there. It
                    was a ... I wouldn't say breeding ground, but it was kind of a preparing ground
                    for people who had gone on to have very good careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were U.S. interests primarily related to the consular
                        field, immigration, terrorism and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Immigration and visitor visas because although Trinidad-born population
                    or origin population in the United States isn't very big but there's a lot of
                    travel back and forth. Especially to Miami but also to New York. There's a
                    Trinidad group or enclave in Brooklyn.</p>
                <p>I'd say that the main interest was economics because Amoco and a joint-venture
                    called Trinidad Tesoro which was an oil company and a number of other companies
                    had links or operations with Trinidad. Texaco had a big refinery there, Amoco
                    was doing offshore drilling. That was the main economic interest.</p>
                <p>A couple of little anecdotes about it: The leader of the opposition was an
                    Indian. When I say Indian here I'm speaking of people of Indian origin whose
                    ancestors came from India after the freeing of the slaves in the mid-1800s. The
                    black-African origin slaves left the land and the land owners had sugar
                    plantations. That was the main form of economic activity at that time. They had
                    to have workers, so they brought indentured workers from India. From what I
                    understand, they took mainly untouchables ... they took the bottom of the social
                    ladder there and brought them to Trinidad. They had ten or 15 years to pay off
                    their passage, so they were virtual slaves. Basdeo Panday who was leader of the
                    opposition, was head of the sugar workers' trade union and later became prime
                    minister, I became quite friendly with him. He took me around the island one
                    day. We just got in his car and we drove all around the island. He showed me
                    many different things. I remember two things that he said because they were
                    interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Basdeo had studied in England and had been an actor earlier so he was very
                    expressive and volatile and lively. He had been accused by people in the
                    American trade union movement of being leftist and Marxist and so forth. He said
                    to me: “Karl Marx was a cold weather philosopher. His philosophy was thought up
                    in countries that had cold dark winters and where people go hungry. Marxism will
                    never thrive in places like this, where no one ever froze to death and no one
                    ever starved to death.” Obviously, Marxism has thrived in a way in Cuba, but it
                    was an interesting perspective that he linked Marxism with: with Marx's physical
                    environment among other things. The other thing I remember from that trip was
                    that we went past a bird sanctuary and just to make conversation, I asked if
                    people did hunting in Trinidad. He said, “oh yes, a lot of hunting.” I said,
                    well what kind of hunting do they do? And he said, “well mostly birds.” And I
                    said, well, it's fairly built up and occupied, where do they hunt? And he said,
                    “oh, in the bird sanctuary, of course.” I raised my eyebrows and he patted me on
                    the arm and he said, “Jonathan you have a lot to learn about Trinidad.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't hunt for the ... what do they call it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Scarlet Ibis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ibis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I don't know what they hunted for but that was an interesting
                    situation.</p>
                <p>Going back to the ethnic business: I remember the Chief Justice of the Supreme
                    Court was an Indian with the wonderful name of Sir Isaac Hyatali. He was a
                    Presbyterian. He kind of encapsulated the Trinidad experience. The Anglican
                    Archbishop was named Clyde Abdullah and he was half Indian and half black and
                    Anglican with a Muslim name. There was a lot of interesting mixture in Trinidad
                    which made life interesting. Culturally the most important event in Trinidad is
                    Carnival. The Indian part of the population isn't deeply involved in it and many
                    of them are not involved in it at all. The African origin part lives for
                    Carnival. Half of the year they prepare for the next Carnival and the other half
                    they talk about the last Carnival. It really is a big deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>In connection with Carnival you also have the steel bands which I found
                    delightful. This is a music form thalegends don't have to be ancient, no one
                    really knows how it startebut the commonly accepted wisdom was that it came
                    about during the time the U.S. took over the base in Chaguaramas which is on the
                    north of the Island of Trinidad. It was one of the bases when the destroyer deal
                    was worked out between Churchill and Roosevelt. Oil was brought in these oil
                    drums and the drums were discarded. The local folks found that by beating on the
                    tops of them they could make a noise. Then with some refinement they found that
                    by, as they call it, tuning the tops, heating it and hammering it in certain
                    ways, they could actually get different notes. You cut off the oil drum so that
                    they were only six or eight inches and you'd have a soprano pan, it was called.
                    If it was 12 or more inches than it might be an alto, tenor and then bass. None
                    of the musicians could read music, it was all done by memory and they trained in
                    outdoor hen yards. I heard bands do very complicated classical music out of
                    these instruments in fantastic ways. The 1812 overture was the most
                    impressive.</p>
                <p>So it was Carnival, the steel drums and with competitions, concerts during the
                    Carnival season. The third element was calypso. When most Americans think of
                    calypso we think of Harry Bellefonte and a Jamaica girl and that type of thing.
                    But calypso in Trinidad is very topical, very current and sometime gaudy, but
                    the music is not the most important part. The lyrics are the most important
                    part. They have calypso competitions and wonderfully named calypsonians are
                    national heroes like the Mighty Sparrow and Lord Kitchener and various other
                    names. Attending a calypso tent, which was the place where the bands would
                    perform before carnival and listening to the music was one of the very nice
                    things about being in Trinidad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the U.S. military base going back to the
                        second world war, does that still exist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, that was a major part of the independence struggle, to get the base
                    back. It formed kind of an extraterritoriality. I think even more important to
                    Eric Williams, despite the employment that it provided to Trinidad residents,
                    natives, he was very big on not having Trinidadians do things that created what
                    he thought was the colonial mentality: poor black people serving rich white
                    people. It was why Trinidad, of all the islands in the Caribbean, had virtually
                    an anti-tourism policy; whereas all the others, one way or another, had used
                    tourism as a labor-intensive activity that doesn't require huge investment, a
                    way to reduce unemployment, to keep people employed and so forth. There are a
                    lot of _______ from tourism. Eric Williams didn't do anything, really, to
                    encourage tourism for the same reason. I'm not sure I agree with what he did,
                    but I understand what was behind it and I think that anyone ... that's the only
                    post-colonial country that I lived in. But I imagine others who have lived in
                    such countries have found what could be referred to as a colonial mentality
                    which has led to less initiative and aggressiveness than one would find in North
                    America or Europe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It was 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in terms of Trinidad's foreign policy and our interest
                        in that? Did that occupy a lot of your time or are you doing mostly internal
                        recording on the labor or opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I did a lot of recording on labor and the opposition. But the Trinidad
                    foreign policy was interesting. They were, as a people, I don't know if
                    pro-American is the right term, but they were very friendly towards Americans.
                    But their government and their policy was strictly going along with third world
                    positions so they voted against us on practically everything at the UN.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I did besides the reporting I just mentioned was
                    demarches. This led to an interesting situation. We used to get these circular
                    tables going to speak to the foreign ministry at the highest appropriate level,
                    urging them to support this or to oppose that. A lot of them were IBRD loans and
                    that sort of thing. This was during the Carter administration and there was a
                    lot of focus as using loans as a means of rewarding or punishing those who had
                    good human rights or bad human rights records. I did this quite often. I
                    remember one time I was called in by one of the senior people in the foreign
                    ministry. The foreign ministry was housed in a building probably about twice the
                    size of this and they had a third secretary who was responsible for R.O. which
                    was “rest of the world” and that was after North America, UK and a couple of key
                    countries. He had most of Africa, most of Asia, all of the middle east and he
                    was ...</p>
                <p>

                <p>RICKERT: He's like a J.O. Anyway, I can't remember the fellow's last name. Trevor
                    was his first name. He called me. We were on friendly terms and he had a woman
                    on either side with a notepad and I said, “uh oh, this is not a good sign.” Then
                    he gave me a prepared lecture very politely and correctly and so forth. He said,
                    “we're a sovereign country and you keep coming in and telling us what to do and
                    we can figure out what to do without being told by the United States. We'd
                    really appreciate it if you wouldn't do this.” I was taken aback at first and I
                    said, “Trevor, we know each other very well, first of all, I don't tell you what
                    to do. I express to you what the views of my government are on a whole range of
                    issues that we hope you'll take in to account. I hope that your embassy in
                    Washington is doing the same with us on issues that are of importance to you. We
                    see this as a basic element in bilateral relations, talking about these things.
                    If you agree, that's fine; if you don't, that's your business but we talk about
                    them. I just don't get this.” He had a script from which he could not deviate
                    and he just repeated what he had to say. I told the Ambassador. Of course, he
                    couldn't tell Washington to stop sending his demarches but I didn't look forward
                    to the next one because there was obviously a matter of pride and some element
                    of misunderstanding there as to what was involved in normal diplomatic exchange
                    in this young country.</p>
                <p>I was there in the late '70s. They had been independent for less than 20 years.
                    They lacked a well-developed foreign service and traditions and I didn't take
                    offense at this. It was a good lesson as to how things work in countries that
                    don't have the long traditions that some others do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you mentioned the years of the Prime Minister Eric
                        Williams and this experience with the foreign ministry. Did you run in to
                        that sort of thing in the labor movement or with the opposition at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. They were very open, very friendly. George Weeks was the head of the
                    oil-field workers trade union. Another Trinidad ... I can't think of the right
                    word, not dilemma but ... you know what I mean, almost a contradiction. He was
                    considered to be the biggest leftist by the AF of L, CIO. He didn't even want me
                    seeing him because he was so leftist. He had two sons in the U.S. Army, living
                    in the U.S. of course. He was always most cordial, most unideological. He used
                    to invite me down to the trade union headquarters which was south of Port of
                    Spain, the capital, where the Texaco refinery was. We'd go always to a Chinese
                    restaurant and we'd have some of his people with him and we'd talk. He told me
                    about his experience going to Moscow and Warsaw one time. He said he had been
                    invited as a Communist-equivalent ... an IVP I suppose. He talked of Moscow and
                    he said, very sour people. No sense of life, no sense of laughter. When they
                    drank they got drunk. It was cold and it was dark and he didn't like it. Then he
                    went to Warsaw and it was much the same. On the way back he passed through Cuba.
                    He said, now that's another story. They're Communist but they know how to have a
                    good time. Obviously he could relate to them even through the language barrier.
                    So we didn't really have much trouble with ... I didn't have any difficulty of
                    the sort I mentioned with the foreign ministry, which wasn't a problem, it was a
                    little blip on the screen with any of the others I dealt with.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>When I left, the trade union federation held a lunch for me. There were 18 or 20
                    unions there from among all the other unions. They gave me a tray with Trinidad
                    and Tobago inscribed on it. One of them said very proudly and happily: “Jonathan
                    we enjoyed knowing you here, you worked very well with us, you've always been
                    very straight forward and not for one moment have we always suspected you of
                    being a CIA agent.” Because at some point in the past, one of my predecessors
                    either had been or had been suspected of being CIA. So they were very sensitive
                    to that, but I apparently passed the test on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How often did you go to Tobago, were there different
                        things you were interested in there or did somebody else in the embassy pay
                        any special interest in that island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Tobago, if I recall correctly, had about 40,000 people out of the whole
                    country's 1.2 million. Tobago did not figure very big in anything that we did. I
                    went over as a tourist on a couple of occasions. There was a trip, if I recall
                    correctly, in connection with some economic council or conference. In the first
                    two weeks I was in Trinidad, Eric Williams did attend that. I met the President
                    and the Prime Minister, Ms. Universe, who was a Trinidadian at the time, a woman
                    named Janelle Commissiong and it was downhill from there on [laughter]. Tobago,
                    rightly or wrongly, was fairly significantly rural. It wasn't easy to get to and
                    there wasn't much there. The main political reason was the party headed by
                    A.N.R. Robinson. He was so often in Port of Spain and I could see him there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a parliament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was opposition within the parliament? Elected
                        opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. There was a two-house parliament, with an appointed
                    senate and an elected lower house. The senate appointments were based on
                    different segments of society. There were always trade unions, there were always
                    educators, there were always different business people. It was done in that way.
                    It could not like the House of Lords. It could not stop legislation, but it did
                    consider legislation passed by the Lower House. Sometimes it was able to get
                    amendments accepted.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Our son, our second child, was born in Trinidad which was a cultural experience
                    in and of itself. We looked into the possibility of my wife leaving and giving
                    birth elsewhere but she would have had to leave early and we had a small
                    daughter. In the end we decided, what would we do with the small daughter? So we
                    decided to have the baby there and it worked out well. But it may not have been
                    the smartest thing we ever did, because the conditions, had there been any
                    significant problem, were not good. But towards the end of our time there, there
                    was a film they made in Chaguaramas for television, an eminently forgettable
                    film called “Gold of the Amazon Women.” The only thing about it that was notable
                    particularly for somebody with Swedish influence in the family or element or
                    family, my wife, it was that the chief Amazon was Anita Ekberg who was well past
                    her prime. We took the kids out to watch the filming and she and her other
                    Amazonians were panning down a path through the jungle which was supposed to be
                    Amazon jungle. She looked over and we thought she looked at this extremely
                    blonde, blue-eyed, young boy and was a little surprised because he did not look
                    like any of the natives of Trinidad. She went on her way to wherever it was she
                    was going.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She didn't remark further on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, we didn't talk to her about it. It was curious. One thing that
                    didn't have a direct effect on Trinidad or wasn't directly related to Trinidad
                    but it had happened during out time there was Jonestown: The 25th anniversary of
                    which had just occurred. A friend of ours from a previous assignment was the
                    Trinidad desk officer and he covered Trinidad and Guyana. He went to Guyana at
                    the request of people in Congress. He actually went out to Jonestown, met with
                    Jim Jones and took residents from Jonestown community out in the field some
                    distance from the town to question them at the request of their family members
                    who claimed that they had been brainwashed. They agreed to talk to him but he
                    said that each one he spoke to gave a planned answer. He said at that time, I
                    remember talking with him and my wife on our terrace outside the house, he said,
                    “You know, they look drugged to me.” He said, “It's not good and it's not right,
                    but what can you say when you talk freely to people who are not under any
                    immediate intimidation or anything like that and they tell you that they're
                    happy and that everything's fine and they don't want to leave and so forth.” It
                    was not long after that, the Jonestown incident took place. Our consular
                    officer, John Adams, was on the first plane that went in to Jonestown and could
                    see the bodies from the air. We've all seen the photographs: a horrendous scene.
                    Later as duty officer, a couple of weeks later, I met Jonestown people who had
                    been ... they had a boat that they used to buy supplies around the Caribbean,
                    they stopped in Trinidad. Trinidadians didn't want to let them land. Jonestown
                    was not a name held in high esteem or anything to do with Jim Jones at that
                    point. They lost all their family and friends. They just happened to be out on
                    one of these buying trips when the mass suicide took place. That was really
                    quite a shocking experience to go through.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Trinidad to me, in some ways, is one of the best examples of what freedom, even
                    relative freedom, can do for people who start with nothing. When you look at the
                    people who came from India as indentured servants: These were considered the
                    scum of Indian society, they had no education, no money, no background. They
                    were mostly Hindus, some are Muslim but, interestingly, Hinduism in Trinidad has
                    no caste system because everyone who came was at the bottom. So they just
                    ignored it. They also eat beef and drink scotch but that's another matter. They
                    consider themselves to be good Hindus.</p>
                <p>Within the space of one to two generations, living in a country where there was
                    relative freedom and a decent education system, these folks have produced a
                    large numbers of doctors, lawyers, architects, dentists, professionals and very
                    successful business people: V. S. Naipaul was from that group. In fact there are
                    two Trinidadian players in literature. Derek Walcott who is black or of African
                    origin, and V.S. Naipaul which is quite something for such a small place. It
                    struck me that Trinidad is a very good example of what freedom of opportunity
                    makes possible for people who are motivated and willing to work hard. Not all of
                    them of course had been successful but an amazingly high percentage and a much
                    higher percentage than ever would have happened had they stayed in India, I am
                    convinced of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time that you were there, people worked for you had
                        liberties of the press and ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: There was freedom of the press. Eric Williams ran a rather autocratic
                    country, he behaved in a rather autocratic way, but he was democratically
                    elected in free and fair elections and between elections he kind of ran the show
                    as he saw fit. At the same time, there were the basic freedoms of religion and
                    expression and assembly and so forth. They were observed very well, I would say,
                    on the whole. In a country that small, there's always somebody who knows
                    somebody and undoubtedly there were pressures to not print certain things, to
                    friendships and personal contacts and so forth. But there was no systematic
                    suppression of human rights. In fact, I wrote in the first human rights report
                    for Trinidad because when those reports first came out, they were done for the
                    countries that were deemed to have human rights problems and then were gradually
                    expanded to cover everyone. I won't say that the arrestees and prisoners were
                    always treated with the utmost delicacy and interrogations were not necessarily
                    in accord with the highest standards but I think if you go in a country, you can
                    tell whether a people are afraid or not. Are they intimidated? Are they
                    unwilling to maintain contact? Having spent so much time in Communist countries,
                    I have something of a feel for that. There was none of that in Trinidad. I
                    suspect that to people who were mistreated, the large majority of the population
                    would probably say they deserved it. That was kind of the attitude. If you were
                    criminal and the police are there, then they'll slap you around a bit. I don't
                    recall any cases of overt torture or gross mistreatment but they certainly
                    didn't live up to the highest standards in every case.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed that you were nominated for the Director
                        General's Reporting Award in 1980. It must have been near the end of your
                        tour in Port of Spain. Was that for a pattern of reporting over the three
                        years or were there some special reports that you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: There were two main reports, plus the spot and other general reporting.
                    We did a very long report on whether Trinidawhich, I think, I was not the sole
                    author but I did a large part of it and kind of put it togethetaking a look at
                    all aspects of Trinidad society, economy, politics, culture and all the rest and
                    trying to figure out where it was going, what would happen when Eric Williams
                    left the scene ... Which was to happen actually not that much after my departure
                    from Trinidad. The Ambassador was very pleased with that.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I did, that I remember particularly, was Trinidad had a lot
                    of small, wack-o, extremist groups. Sometimes two or three people. As far as I
                    knew, no one had ever tried to figure out what they all were and which ones
                    meant anything and which ones didn't. The political section had very good
                    newspaper archives. The FSN secretary and her predecessors for years had been
                    clipping things out. I pulled everything together. It was 18 different groups
                    that had appeared in that press. I got hold of everything that I could find in
                    open sources and went and discussed it with the counter-intelligence folks who
                    were actually very reticent. They said that there were only a couple of them
                    that we needed to be concerned with. It provided, perhaps in one place, the
                    first real compilation of information on these various groups. Some of them were
                    black power, some of them were crypto-Marxists. Some of them were just wack-o
                    but there were a lot of them for such a small place. I felt, and the Ambassador
                    and DCM felt, that it was a situation where we ought to know more about who they
                    were.</p>
                <p>Trinidad had a black power uprising in the early '70s before I got there. It was
                    a minor military revolt. That was always in people's minds because that had
                    showed that there was some tinder there for this kind of thing if people felt
                    dissatisfaction to a significant degree or if rabble rousers were successful
                    enough in stirring things up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do the political military work of the embassy such
                        as it was? Ship visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. We had no resident military or defense attach�. We were covered out
                    of Caracas. The main activity we had was an occasional ship visit. Those were
                    fun and always well received. I don't remember the exact ships that came but we
                    didn't have any battleships. We had some cruisers or some destroyers. They held
                    open houses and invited people on board. There were so many people who
                    remembered the old days, with mixed feelings, but a lot of people had good
                    feelings about Chaguaramas because it had provided employment and it was in
                    fact, the symbol that Trinidad mattered. Of course there's always Coca Cola
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a Navy base?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>RICKERT: It was a Navy base, yes. The base was still there, but most of the
                    buildings had just been allowed to deteriorate. Some warehouses were still being
                    used, this going back to Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Trinidad had a military establishments that went on some
                        of our training programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had arranged that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The visiting we were covered as I said, out of Caracas, some of that was
                    done by the visiting defense attach�s who'd come twice a year, something like
                    that. I did some of the set-up work on that. But they had a coast guard and a
                    Trinidad defense force. My recollection was that it was 500 people, something
                    like that. They took advantage of IMET and also, if I recall correctly, they
                    used FMF to get some upgraded patrol boats. Drugs had not become a major problem
                    when I was there but I think most of us could see the handwriting on the wall
                    that any of those islands had the potential of being a transit for drugs headed
                    north from Columbia or Bolivia or wherever. Trinidad being bigger than any of
                    the other islands except for Jamaica and Hispaniola of course ... but of the
                    English islands, it was a tempting target. My understanding is that subsequently
                    there has been considerable amount of concern about drugs transiting through
                    Trinidad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a lot to do with the British High Commission
                        at the time that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assumed they played a significant role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Mostly socially because there really wasn't that much going on
                    politically. We compared notes on how Eric Williams was and tried to figure out
                    what was going on. Their interests, essentially, were commercial as ours were.
                    There were a number of British banks and other Brit-Insurance Companies and
                    others there. Politically Trinidad was more aligned to Africa than to Europe and
                    North America.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>There was one little incident that was perhaps the most bizarre incident that
                    I've had or I observed in my foreign service career, but it says a lot about
                    Trinidad at the time. The Argentine Ambassador was living in a house that was
                    rented. The house was sold by the owner to the Nigerian Embassy. At the time of
                    the sale there were about three months left on the lease. I'm no real estate
                    expert but as I understand it, if you sell a house that has a legal lease, you
                    can't throw the people out until the lease expires, that's the contract that
                    goes with the sale.</p>
                <p>But the Nigerian High Commissioner was impatient and tried to get the Argentine
                    to leave and the Argentine refused. One night, in the middle of the night, a
                    bunch of goons came and raided the house, threw the Argentine Ambassador and all
                    of his belongings out on the street, ripped the flag down, ripped the shield
                    down and occupied the house. The Argentines complained to the foreign ministry
                    and the foreign ministry said, “We understand your concern but this is a
                    bilateral problem between you and Nigeria.” It was a huge scandal obviously.
                    What eventually happened was the foreign minister at least had the decency to
                    tell the Nigerian High Commissioner and saiI don't know what exactly he said but
                    he did say, he'd never speak to him again. This message was conveyed in Lagos
                    and the Nigerian government had the sense and decency to recall the High
                    Commissioner so the approximate cause of all of this unpleasantness was removed.
                    But the Trinidadians never took any steps to resolve the issue. Since the period
                    of time was relatively short, it ended before the Nigerians had legal control of
                    the house within a relatively short time. They withdrew their Ambassador and had
                    a charg� there for an extended period but it was quite an odd performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unusual. I see you also received a Meritorious Honor Award

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That was for reporting, yes. The embassy was much more proactive on

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>RICKERT: One last footnote which isn't about Trinidad. Before I left, I did a TDY
                    in Surinam because when I was coming back to Washington I was going to be in the
                    Office of Caribbean Affairs, ARACAR, with responsibility for Trinidad, Guyana
                    and Suriname. Suriname was an even smaller embassy. Nancy Ostrander was the
                    ambassador there. The DCM had to leave or his political officer, the DCM, had to
                    leave on short notice for personal reasons not permanently but for a period of
                    time. They just had a military coup there. So ARA agreed to my going down and
                    filling in as a TDY political officer. So I had a good introduction to Suriname
                    before taking over the Suriname desk. It was a lot of fun, it was a much more
                    open society in terms of willingness to be able to talk to people. In Trinidad
                    you can meet with anybody but they wouldn't say much. In Suriname, they would
                    not only meet with you but they were very open. In the three weeks I was there I
                    met the President, the Prime Minister, about half the cabinet, the trade union
                    leaders, Alcoa had a big operation there and the union worker Frank Darby was
                    later murdered ... and also Desire Bouterse or the corporal who had staged the
                    coup and a number of his thugs and others.</p>
                <p>Nancy and I went one time to meet with the Prime Minister, Chin A. Sen. He was of
                    Chinese origin and he was very despondent about the way things were going. Nancy
                    and I convinced him not to resign which I thought was because he was viewed in
                    Washington and by the embassy as a stabilizing force. You don't think as a
                    mid-level officer that you were going to be involved in trying to convince prime
                    ministers not to resign. The scale of these countries, there is only, roughly,
                    350,000 people in Suriname. There are more Surinamese in Holland than there are
                    in Suriname.</p>
                <p>In any case, then when I left, I came back to Washington, took over as desk
                    officer and had responsibility for those three countries to start with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did you spend any time in Guyana?</hi>

                <p>RICKERT: Only one visit on the way back from Suriname. I stayed with Dick Dwyer
                    who had been shot at Jonestown. He was DCM there. That was kind of a scary
                    place, I have to say; much poorer and much more lawless than either Trinidad or
                    Suriname but part of the same Caribbean culture with the same tradition of
                    colonialism and sugar and other tropical products and exploitation of slave
                    labor and all the rest. So one could feel at home culturally in Guyana very
                    easily if one had lived in Trinidad or other parts of the British West-Indian
                    empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So as the desk officer for Trinidad or Guyana or Suriname
                        you did the usual desk officer things, you liaised with the embassies in
                        Washington and went in the field, made recommendations up the line ...
                        Anything particular about this period which was at the end of the Carter
                        Administration and the beginning of the Reagan administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, I don't know where you were at that time but our assistant
                    secretary was Bill Bowdler. One of the lessons that I learned very quickly when
                    the Reagan Administration came in was what happened to people who were on the
                    wrong side of the new administration because Bowdler was there one day and he
                    was gone the next. There were no farewells or anything else. He was out the door
                    because, I gathered, of the position that he had taken legally, correctly,
                    honorably, on behalf of the previous administration on Central America. So he
                    was an immediate casualty who was eventually succeeded by Tom Enders.</p>
                <p>Rob Warren was our office director when I got there. Richard Howard was the
                    deputy. We had a number of good desk officers. Marsha Barnes who took over
                    Guyana at a certain point is now Ambassador of Suriname and later was director
                    of Caribbean affairs. Her first tour in the foreign service was in Guyana. She
                    spent a fairly significant chunk of her career down there. When Tom Enders came
                    in, as I understand it, there were pressures to have a bunch of DAS [Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary] including political ones. He insisted on having two DAS's
                    for ARA. One was Steve Bosworth and the other was Ted Briggs. They really had
                    their hands full because, I've forgotten the exact number of countries, but it
                    was in the range of 25 or so countries in ARA. Just with reasonable travel, that
                    meant that there was usually one DAS. The assistant secretary was gone and the
                    two DAS's were there or one of the DAS's were traveling. So it was tough, but
                    that's the way Enders apparently wanted to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume his main focus was on Central America and things
                        other than the three countries that you were responsible for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right. Steve Bosworth was our DAS. The main concerns in the Caribbean
                    were the Reagan Administration's Caribbean Base Initiative which was an effort
                    to increase trade and investment and help raise the standard of living in the
                    region and then to prevent further spread of Communism. There was a lot of
                    concern about Suriname. Steve Bosworth was very much involved on Suriname
                    because no one knew where this Corporal Desire Bouterse was going to take the
                    country. There was concern that he might have Marxist links or leanings. The
                    U.S. had been caught by surprise in the Western Hemisphere before and the Reagan
                    Administration, I think quite rightly, didn't want to see that again even in a
                    very small place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I understand the situation in Suriname there was
                        presumably a debate between those who thought that we'd try to work with
                        him, work around him, have contact with him, as I guess, Ambassador
                        Ostrander did and you mentioned the visit you had made with her ... and
                        those who thought maybe the best thing was to maybe try to oppose him,
                        isolate him, boycott him. I did an interview in this program with Ambassador
                        Denis Hayes who was there much later than the time we're talking about but
                        as I understood from him, he decided not to have any contact with
                        Bouterse.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Bouterse there and the military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... feeling that anything he did would be misinterpreted,
                        it was better to shun him and then I'm not sure I pushed him hard enough on
                        the success of that approach which I kind of wondered about. I wish I had
                        debated it a little bit more. But anyway, is that the kind of thing that you
                        had to deal with at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: My recollection is that we didn't want to do anything that would raise
                    him in the estimation of the population. But we needed a key contact with him in
                    order to know what he was up to. I don't recall any efforts to isolate him
                    during this time. I don't recall the exact date of the military coup but it was
                    early in 1980, February, something like that. So Bouterse was unknown to the
                    outside word. People were still trying to figure out who he was, what he wanted,
                    why he had done this, where he was headed, all these other things ... I remember
                    I sent, I don't remember his name but the Army found a fellow, a Major if I
                    recall, who was sent as defense attach�. We haven't had a defense attach�
                    before, but he was an American of Indonesian origin and therefore spoke Dutch.
                    Bouterse did not speak English as I recall, or spoke very poor English. The hope
                    was that through this defense attach� we could get a closer contact with
                    Bouterse, not to glorify him or to get him attach� but know what he was up to
                    and why.</p>
                <p>When Nancy Ostrander left, a very good career officer, Jack Crowley, who had been
                    DCM in a number of places and sort of a career ARA hand, took over. He was there
                    for a while. I think, from what I could tell, did a very solid job. He was
                    replaced after a couple of years at the request of Tom Enders actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm very interested in hearing what you're about to say
                        given that build up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, Enders called Rob Warren and me and our deputy director, Dick
                    Howard up to his office one day and said, “How are things going in Suriname?” We
                    said, “going well.” Well, “How's Jack Crowley doing there?” We said, “Fine
                    professionally, he's doing a good job so forth.” “How does he get on with
                    Bouterse?”</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Rob Warren actually carried the conversation and said that he talked to him from
                    time to time but there is a cultural difference and generational difference
                    between the two. Enders, I'm sorry I have to quote this but he said: “Well, I
                    think we should have somebody down there who can really get in with Bouterse and
                    his people.” “Somebody who'd go drinking and whoring with him” was the term he
                    used. Enders didn't think Crowley was the man so Crowley was recalled. The
                    person who was supposed to have replaced him ran into problems. He had been in
                    Afghanistan just prior or was it after, I don't know if I've got the chronology
                    exactly right but Spike Dubbs had been assassinated there. Then we had a series
                    of charg�s maintaining relations on a very reduced level. This officer had been
                    there as charg�. He had, according to what everybody said, I can't say this from
                    personal knowledge, but apparently a girlfriend, an Australian girl who came and
                    stayed with him there for extended periods. Others didn't have local girlfriends
                    or spouses and some complaints were made. This got to the undersecretary for
                    management. When the undersecretary heard about this, he blocked the
                    appointment. I can't vouch for anything except the quote from Tom Enders for
                    which I was personally present, but I heard the rest of this from enough sources
                    so that I think in outlines at least it is an accurate picture of what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody went to Suriname?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Frankly ... I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was perhaps after your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It may have been after my time because I honestly don't remember who
                    ended up going. As time went on, Rob moved on. Enders was told he was going to
                    get a DAS he didn't want, a political gentleman named John Upston. He refused to
                    accept Upston. To make a long story short, Upston agreed to take a political
                    appointment. He was made the coordinator for Caribbean affairs and he took over
                    Rob Warren's office and he had his own secretary but because he had a, shall we
                    say, less than sterling reputation, Rob and Dick Howard and all of us went to
                    see Enders and asked that we not be put under his direct direction. Enders, to
                    his credit, created a special position that supervised no one but went around,
                    made speeches and visited the region. Upston was a perfectly amiable fellow. He
                    wasn't nasty. He accepted this arrangement. He didn't make anyone feel that they
                    had stabbed him in the back or anything like that. The tradeoff was that we
                    didn't get a director because the slot was taken. So Dick Howard, who was really
                    a career ARA person and a very good and decent fellow and very good officer,
                    became the acting director. And I, as the senior most desk officer, became the
                    acting Deputy Director. So I gave up Guyana to Marsha Barnes who was delighted
                    to get it back and did the deputy stuff in the office.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And continued to do Suriname and Trinidad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right.</p>
                <p>A couple of interesting things that happened. What happened during the Reagan
                    administration? I remember they were very concerned, as I mentioned, about
                    Communism possibly in Surinam. The Surinamese foreign minister was due to come
                    to have a meeting with Secretary Haig. I was told to write very tough talking
                    points which I did, which were cleared up through the chain and went to Haig. I
                    was the note taker at this meeting. The Surinamese foreign minister came in.
                    Haig put his arm around him and didn't use one of the talking points. He
                    achieved the same end through different means. I'm not saying he just rolled
                    over but he figured that in this case, I'm assuming, that talking tough to a
                    person representing 350,000 people was less likely to get the desired end than
                    showing some concern and interest and friendliness ... So that was one little
                    lesson there.</p>
                <p>One bizarre Trinidad thing happened while I was there. After I left Trinidad, the
                    second DCM, I mentioned the first was Mike Yohn, the second was Joe O'Mahony who
                    had spent time in India and Latin America: a fine person who had been very badly
                    shot up in WWII and was in a lot of pain a lot of the time. Joe was a decent
                    person and a good DCM. He was charg� after I left because the next ambassador
                    who was a politico had not yet come. There was a delay in his getting there. I
                    came back from lunch one day and I was told by my secretary, “you have a flash
                    message from Trinidad.” That's almost a contradiction in terms. I had never seen
                    a flash any time in a place except during my time in the OP center. The flash
                    dealt with the following: Prime Minister Williams had died suddenly. Well, you
                    don't need a flash message for that, but the decision had been made to cremate
                    him in Trinidad. They needed a crematorium, because the only cremating that was
                    done in Trinidad was done on the banks of the streams, Indian style. That was
                    not considered sufficiently respectful for a person who came from an African and
                    Christian background. So I had about three or four days to get a crematorium ...
                    a portable crematorium to Trinidad so that Eric Williams could be cremated.
                    Where do you start?</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>At first I called DoD [Department of Defense]. They were extremely pleasant but
                    they said they had no such thing. They didn't know of such a thing and they
                    couldn't give any help. I scratched my head and I finally though, well, let me
                    call Gawler's Funeral Home out on Wisconsin Avenue. They had handled the
                    arrangements for Abraham Lincoln's funeral. I figured they had long experience
                    when they handled the arrangements for my father's funeral in 1950. I got ahold
                    of the cremations guy there and explained the dilemma and he said to me, he was
                    very polite and understanding and helpful and said: “You know, I hope you don't
                    mind my asking but, most of the time, it's found more efficient to take the body
                    to the crematorium than the crematorium to the body.” I hadn't told him who this
                    was for, I said I couldn't, because it was all very hush-hush. I said, “I
                    understand, but in this case it doesn't work.” I said it was for someone outside
                    the country. So he said, there's a company in Orlando that makes crematoria. He
                    gave me the name and the phone number and everything else and he said, “Why
                    don't you call them and see what you can find out.” So I got hold of someone
                    there and they said that they had a crematorium that had just come off the
                    assembly line and was test fired and was ready to go for use in Michigan but
                    that it could be diverted. We got the dimensions and found that it would fit in
                    a 747 cargo plane, big enough to take it. They of course wanted to see the color
                    of the money, which I don't blame them. The payer for this operation was TRINTOC
                    (Trinidad and Tobago Oil Company Limited) which was the Trinidad oil company
                    which had an office in New York. I put them in touch with TRINTOC and TRINTOC
                    took care of the money. The crematorium was trucked down to Miami. We had to
                    hold the plane a bit but it got on the plane and got there by the deadline.</p>
                <p>It was one of the more bizarre things that I did in foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Trinidad government came to the embassy for help
                        and it was told that this would be a nice gesture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I guess. I could only surmise. As I recall, the cable was a request.
                    They certainly didn't cook it up themselves. It may be that the Deputy Prime
                    Minister or someone mentioned it to the charg� and he said, well, we'll see what
                    we can do. Whether it was request or demand or just something that they heard
                    about, I no longer recall. The charg� took it on and was “charged” to get hold
                    of this crematorium. It was a gas-fired crematorium. They had plenty of gas in
                    Trinidad so that's what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, that, I've heard mixed stories about that. There were problems
                    with it but I think it eventually worked. There's a little footnote in this. I'm
                    jumping ahead in this story and I won't go in to all the gory details but some
                    years later in the late '80s I was in Bulgaria and we had a CODEL [Congressional
                    Delegation] a large CODEL there. I ended up chatting with the military aide that
                    normally accompany these CODELs. He asked where I served and so forth, I
                    mentioned Trinidad and he said, “Oh, Trinidad. I worked for BWIA, the British
                    West-India Airways, for many years.” To make a long story short, he said, he
                    knew that it must have been me there who made the arrangements, but he picked it
                    up from the point where there was a crematorium and all the rest and he got it
                    taken care of. So here was an American diplomat and an American military
                    officer; He was a Reserve officer; He did this in his free time, so to speak,
                    standing in the garden of a Bulgarian government villa in Sofia talking about
                    the cremation of the Trinidad prime minister. It was really kind of macabre. It
                    was very enjoyable to both of us to meet the other half of this process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It helps about your assignment in Caribbean affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: There are a couple of other things I might mention. The way things
                    worked back then. Of course, the Caribbean countries were very small. When Rob
                    Warren was Office Director, a foreign minister would come to town. There were no
                    representational funds. So Rob would ask, “Anybody from the office want to have
                    lunch with the prime minister of Grenada or the foreign minister of some other
                    island like Barbados?”, and we'd all trundle off to the Foreign Service Club and
                    split the bill. That was our representation and entertainment. It was nice for
                    meeting some of these guys, but I thought a little bit from the skimpy side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It reminds me of the time I took Javier Perez de Cuellar
                        to have a bite to eat at the Kennedy Center way before he became Secretary
                        General of the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Another thing I ended up doing in Caribbean Affairs... There were a
                    couple of people that were not really persona non grata with the State
                    Department but whom we couldn't ignore completely. One was Cheddi Jagan, the
                    once and future prime minister of Guyana. When he came to town I, with my
                    elevated position as Acting Deputy Director of Caribbean Affairs, would be given
                    the pleasure of meeting with him because nobody of higher rank than I would see
                    him. I only remember one meeting with him. I remember he was a very charming,
                    engaging, articulate fellow who was fun to talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And didn't feel insulted that he had to talk to you as
                        opposed to somebody else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No. I think he was pretty savvy. I don't remember meeting with Eric
                    Gairy, the prime minister of Grenada who believed in UFO's and had Grenada
                    introduce UN General Assembly resolutions on the subject of UFO's. But I had
                    correspondence with him and talked to him on the phone. I don't recall meeting
                    him, but I ended up with some of those tasks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and the U. S. military action in Grenada came well

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. One other little incident that was one of the less
                    attractive sides of the Foreign Servicand I might want to edit this when I get
                    to iI had a call one day when I was still on the Guyana desk from a gentleman
                    whose first name I can't remember, but his last name was McCormack, and he later
                    became assistant secretary for EB (Economic Bureau).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Richard something. I can't remember for sure. But he called me up as the
                    Guyana desk officer and chewed me up one side and down another because of the
                    problems that a businessman who had gonhe was a staffer for Helms at the
                    time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McCormack was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: McCormack was and he had a fellow who was dealing with the Guyana
                    government and the embassy hadn't helped this guy. This was an African American
                    fellow who was taking advantage of some kind of a set-aside to provide rum to
                    American Commissary, military commissaries, and I had met and spoken with the
                    guy. He had essentially a trade dispute with the Guyana authorities. He claimed
                    that he'd been ripped off and he'd been cheated, and so forth and so on. And
                    McCormack really tore a strip off me in the State Department for our failure to
                    get this guy's money. He was loud, abusive, obnoxious over the phone. I put the
                    phone down shaking and immediately typed up everything I could remember and sent
                    it to Steve Bosworth. No one wanted to have someone be blindsided at a higher
                    level by this. And after I calmed down, a couple of hours later, McCormack
                    called back and, in a sense, apologized, and said, “I'm sorry I had to do that,
                    but he was sitting in my office, and I had to put on a show for him.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thanks a lot! Anything else? We haven't, other than this
                        trade dispute, haven't talked much about Guyana, and you mentioned Jagan
                        coming to see you. Is there anything else...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>RICKERT: There was not much. Guyana was in a quiet period then. The name of the
                    prime minister who was somebody that we favored over Jagan escapes me, who later
                    became a tin pot dictator of his own. He was running dishonest elections and
                    persecuting the Indians there mostly through disenfranchising them to a
                    sufficient extent yet reelected though the Indians were the majority in Guyana
                    by that time. And Guyana was of interest, but I don't recall anything of
                    particular note had to do with our relations with Guyana during the talks the
                    year that I dealt with it. There are a couple of other things that I might
                    mention. The next ambassador to Trinidad after Irv Cheslaw was a black
                    politician from the American Virgin Islands, a republican, believe it or not,
                    named Melvin Evans. He was actually a very nice man. He'd been the Virgin
                    Islands delegate in Congress. I learned a little something about Congress from
                    him. He was named, and I didn't hear from him, and I waited and waited, and so
                    forth. He finally called, and we had a chat. His hearing was scheduled for
                    Monday afternoon. He came to town on Sunday, and I had a meeting with him on
                    Sunday, and we chatted and so forth. His first question was, Jonathan, what does
                    an ambassador do?” I told him a little bit, and he had read some things about
                    Trinidad, but he hadn't done very much. Well, of course, when it came time for
                    his hearing, he received, shall we say, members or former members courtesy, and
                    wasn't asked any questions of any sort at all. And so he hadn't done the usual
                    homework which, I know, you were very familiar with to assignments as
                    ambassador. But he was very relaxed through this whole thing. He was a very nice
                    man, a very decent man, but he had medical problems and actually died in
                    Trinidad during his time there. He went over for his meeting with President
                    Reagan, and he was there with his family and so forth, and I had accompanied him
                    just to be there as kind of an escort. He said, “Jonathan, come on in. You're
                    welcome to come in for my meeting with the president.” I declined and said,
                    “This is a moment, Mr. Ambassador, for you and your family, and not for
                    outsiders.” As much as I would like to have done it, his wife was there, his
                    children were there, and some grandchildren. This was not...I mean it was very
                    kind and thoughtful of him to ask me to participate, but not a situation which I
                    thought I should insert myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe you should have. He probably really didn't
                        _____________________?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was, but I didn't feel that I should. I did meet Vice President Bush
                    on that occasion. He was wandering around in the vicinity. We had another
                    ambassador named Milan Bish who went through Barbados who was a developer of
                    commercial real estate from Nebraska or some such place. As you recall, one of
                    the very good things in my view as one who was never an ambassador that Ronald
                    Reagan did was to call each appointee to tell him or her personally that he had
                    been...or she had been...named ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it was really a request, a question, “Would you
                        be willing to serve as the United States ambassador to somewhere?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>RICKERT: You're entirely right. Milan Bish was a very jovial and outgoing Elks
                    and Lions Club type of guy but with a somewhat limited geographic background. He
                    told us about this story about how this had happened and how he got this call.
                    He knew he was up for something, but he didn't know exactly what. Ronald Reagan
                    got on the line, and they chit-chatted, and he said, “Well, I want you to know
                    that I'm offering you the position as U. S. Ambassador to Barbados, and I hope
                    that you will accept,” and so forth and so on. And Bish said, “Oh, yes, Sir, I'd
                    be very delighted to accept.” They finished their conversation, and the first
                    thing he did was to run for an atlas because he also didn't know where or what
                    Barbados was. And we heard that he was telling the story in Barbados. We quietly
                    suggested that he save that for the Elks of the Lions Club in Nebraska and not
                    for Barbados because people from small countries can be very prickly about these
                    things. So anyway, he was the ambassador that was totally ignored during the
                    invasion of Grenada which was staged on Grenada which was technically one of his
                    areas of responsibility. He was accredited to Barbados but co-accredited to
                    Grenada and some other smaller islands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And wasn't kept informed, and wasn't consulted,
                        certainly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. The whole thing was just done over his head because, I'm afraid, he
                    was in over his head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok. Anything else about the Caribbean? I should mention
                        that I never had any Foreign Service experience with the Caribbean but have
                        gone as a tourist lecturer on a couple of cruise ships through a number of
                        the islands including Trinidad. You said that tourism wasn't, at the time
                        that you were there, too big. I'm not sure it was when I was there. We were
                        only there for a few hours, but we certainly had a good time and went and
                        saw the Scarlet Ibis at the Wildlife Refuge. Anything else? This was '80 to
                        '82.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. During 1982 I moved from the Trinidad desk to the Romania
                    desk. John Davis was the director at the time, and Bill Farrand was his deputy.
                    And Bill and I had served in Moscow together, and I think it was largely through
                    Bill that I got the job. I've maintained an interest in Romania...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...since having served there and having the Romanian
                        language.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>RICKERT: ...and also, while I was working Caribbean affairs, I finished my
                    Master's degremy Master's thesifor the grade of GW. The topic was “Romanian
                    Government Policies Towards Ethnic Minorities During Post World War II Period.”
                    So, I was very pleased to go back. I'd had a long-standing interest in Eastern
                    Europe, and I was delighted to be working with Bill whom I knew. John Davis,
                    whom I didn't know, but whom I came to know and eventually served as DCM under
                    in Romania some years later, so that was the beginning of a good relationship. I
                    didn't know John very well during that time. 95% of his time was spent on Poland
                    because it was martial law. John was one of the foreign service's biggest Poland
                    experts and went from that job to become charg� there and stayed there from '83
                    to '90 approximately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was first charg� and then ambassador. He ended up with 13 years
                    service in Poland which is a lot. So I really didn't get to know him that well.
                    Jack Scanlon was the desk officer when I arrived there, and then Mark Palmer
                    took over shortly thereafter. Jack was supposed to go to Poland as ambassador.
                    Because of Polish dissatisfaction with our policy, they refused to give
                    agr�ment, and he waited and waited. Eventually he gave up and went to Yugoslavia
                    instead. And that was when John Davis went to Warsaw as charg� until the Poles
                    saw sense. That was expected to be three to six months, but it ended up being a
                    lot longer than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going on with U. S.-Romania relations during that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, one doesn't want to leave the impression that personalities are
                    essential factor in all this, but you have to recall that the U. S. ambassador
                    to Bucharest at that time was David B. Funderburk who, by some accounts, was one
                    of the least appropriate political appointees in living memory. I could go one
                    for a tape and a half on David Funderburk, which I won't do, but he was hell's
                    prot�g�. He knew the language, he knew a lot about the country...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he hadn't been in Bucharest.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>RICKERT: He'd been in Romania. So, from that point of view it was not at all a
                    bad assignment, but he had a deep and abidin“distrust” is too kind of a terfor
                    the Foreign Service, and it made it very difficult to work effectively with him.
                    He considered the Foreign Service to be pink and soft on communism and unwilling
                    to tackle difficult dictators, etc., etc., etc. And it was not easy working with
                    him. His first DCM was Sam Frye who I had worked with in Moscow and was friendly
                    with personally. I mean, we weren't close friends, but we were colleagues in
                    Moscow and had known each other. That was the saving grace there, but Sam didn't
                    last that long, and we had real problems trying to find somebody to go out to
                    work for Funderburk. So, in the end it was decided, I think correctly, I
                    recommended and ended up happening, that the political consular and career guy,
                    a fine person with a good professional credentials but who happened also to be
                    personally of a very Right Wing orientation. Frank Corey ended up being the DCM,
                    and that worked perfectly OK because Funderburk didn't consider him to be a spy
                    or worse. The two main issues that I can think of in U. S.-Romanian relations
                    during my two years on the desk, were: one, the annual review of most favored
                    nation status which, of course, stemmed from the Helsinki Accords in 1975. This
                    became an annual exercise. As many people remember and many people have
                    forgotten, the whole idea of linking Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade to this
                    process had to do with emigration from the Soviet Union. It was broadened to
                    include Eastern Europe subsequently. Then, by extension, interest groups of
                    various sorts did something that I personally didn't think was correct but was
                    entirely understandable. This involved extending the emigration aspect to cover
                    all human rights problems. Anyone who had problems with the human rights
                    practices of Romania and any other countries covered by the Jackson-Vanik
                    Amendment used the annual hearings on renewal of MFN as a means to beat the
                    country about the head and shoulders. I never was an apologist for Romania's
                    human rights record or its treatment of its citizens. I did have some problems
                    about using a law that speaks about emigration as an omnibus pretext to try to
                    block MFN for Romania for purposes that had nothing to do with the stated
                    purpose of the law. Interestingly, the Assistant Secretary for Human Rights at
                    that time was Elliott Abrams. He had worked with Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson
                    as a staffer. I went on a trip at one point with Abrams to Romania. I spoke to
                    him on this issue on several occasions. And Abrams was certainly not soft on
                    Commies or human rights violators. I remember him saying very clearly,
                    “Jackson-Vanik is emigration. Jackson knew he couldn't buy more than emigration
                    with this piece of legislation; it wasn't attractive enough to be able to carry
                    a heavier human rights agenda.” So emigration was selected as the issue where we
                    could really make a difference and possibly get it to work. Of course, it didn't
                    work with the Soviet Union as it turned out. It did work for some years with
                    Romania, and emigration numbers were higher, I'm convinced, than otherwise.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: ...for Romania was freedom for emigration, and the impetus was Jewish
                    emigration to Israel. But it wasn't framed as a “Jews Only” law, and it
                    was...the Jewish organizations in this country, of course, kept very careful
                    track of the number of Romanian Jews who were allowed to emigrate to Israel or
                    to the United States for that matter. They used their relative success and
                    relative failure as their yardstick. They used this as a means of putting
                    pressure on the Romanians to perform better, but that wasn't the determining
                    factor. That was part of the mix. If fact, the majority of the emigrants were
                    not Jews. The biggest single group during those years was Germans to Germany.
                    Now, the sordid part of all this, as is well known today, is that both the Jews
                    going to Israel and the Germans going to Germany were in effect bought out by
                    the receiving governments. The exact arrangements, I don't know what they were.
                    There were payments made. So, although Romania lost skilled people, educated
                    people, they did get something in return.</p>

                    figures. It was usually, as I recall, it was the DAS who would actually do the

                    recall for certain on that. A document goes to the Hill with the President's
                    name on it, and it shows that it's serious in this case. Interestingly, when
                    John Davis was office director, he knew that David Funderburk did not agree with
                    the idea of MFN for Romania due to human rights concerns. So he always sent a
                    whole packet to David in both years. The whole packet went to embassy Bucharest,
                    and Funderburk reviewed it. He may have ground his teeth and snarled and
                    everything else, but he didn't object to it in writing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the package sent after the fact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. It was before it went to the Congress. To me this has always been
                    interesting. He wrote a book after he left Bucharest called Pinstripes and Reds
                    in which he implies that he opposed MFN but the State Department people somehow
                    convinced the President to go along with it. And it's carefully worded because
                    he can't say that he opposed it, he had chances to oppose it in writing, and he
                    may eveI don't recalhe may even have made small textural suggestions, edits, and
                    so forth, to the package, but he did not object. I think his biggest mistake was
                    his failure to realize that the ambassador, as representative of the President,
                    has free reign to say what he thinks should happen and should not happen. He may
                    well be overruled, but he would have had on record that, “I think this is a
                    mistake because boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.” But he never did it. He would
                    mumble and groan and carp and cavil, but not put forth a reasoned series of
                    arguments as to why the policy direction was misguided or wrong in some way.</p>

                        think you were to talk about a major U. S.-Romanian bilateral issue of the
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. The '80s was a period of decline in the internal situation in
                    Romania and, consequently, also a decline in U. S.-Romanian relations.
                    Ceausescu, the dictator of Rumania, decided in the early '80s to repay all of
                    the country's foreign debts because he felt, apparently, that being indebted to
                    foreign countries was a form of dependency that he was unwilling to accept for
                    the longer time. So there was a Draconian drive to try to increase exports,
                    minimize imports, and pay off the outstanding debts to various countries and the
                    international financial institutions as quickly as possible. This, of course,
                    had a very serious effect on the standard of life of the ordinary Romanians as
                    well as being a hindrance to Romania's economic development because the
                    factories didn't get updated technology. They weren't even able to get parts in
                    some cases for the equipment they had. Libraries couldn't bring in books or
                    periodicals from abroad, so fields like medicine and science were hindered in
                    their development. It was a dark period for Romania in general. At the same time
                    there was a crackdown on human rights and against religious believers of various
                    sorts, and the Ceausescu regime also had a very strongly pro-natalist policy of
                    trying to increase the population by banning abortion and punishing those who
                    had abortions or performed abortions. So, all in all, it was not one of the best
                    periods in our relations. In the midst of all this, the government decreed that
                    those who had applied for emigration and who had received higher education in
                    Romania, had to repay the state at a certain rate for the education they had
                    received. The repayment had to be in hard currency, and Romanians were not
                    allowed to hold hard currency. The decree was named, if I recall “Number 409”
                    which was the number of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. So it was really a kind of
                    a counter-pressure to the pressure that we were putting on with Jackson-Vanik.
                    Under Jackson-Vanik, if any country were to place more than minimal fees for
                    emigration, we were required to suspend MFN. The leadership of the Department,
                    principally Lawrence Eagleburger and others, felt this was not a good thing to
                    do, that MFN was useful in our relationship. It still provided a certain amount
                    of leverage over the Romanian government. It enabled a number of people to
                    emigrate who otherwise would not have been able to, so the decision was made to
                    try to find a way to maintain MFN which meant getting rid of Decree 409. That
                    meant extensive negotiations largely between Mark Palmer who was the DAS at the
                    time, and the Romanian ambassador who was Mircea Malita. He was a very
                    interesting man and a scholar, a former minister of education, a former advisor
                    to Ceausescu, a very educated and cultured man, not confrontational, and not
                    ideological, but obviously there to serve the interests of his government and
                    state. Mark and Malita met on a number of occasions, and through the discussions
                    they were eventually able to come up with a solution that the Romanians bought
                    when they saw that we were serious about pulling MFN if they didn't somehow
                    neutralize this Decree 409. They decided that those who were leaving would not
                    have to pay, but there were a few who had already paid and gotten oumoney had
                    been brought in from abroad. This caused certain problems as well because then
                    they wanted their money back when the deal was struck. We would continue to
                    support Romania and have the administration work for MFN. There was an
                    understanding that we would try to encourage, to take certain steps with the
                    Congress to increase trade to Romania which was something that they wanted. On
                    the Romanian side, they did not null the decree. They simply suspended it. So,
                    the end result was that MFN was continued, emigration resumed, and an
                    embarrassing chapter was over. It was interesting to watch Mark and Malita work
                    on this very important issue and to see the give and take with two people seeing
                    the importance of maintaining status quo over MFN but not quite sure how to go
                    about it. Malita, of course, was subject to the whims of his dictator at home,
                    but fortunately I think the end result was satisfactory for all concerned.</p>

                        over the years?</hi>

                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Let's go back a little bit in history. In 1965 the first long-service
                    dictator in Romania, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej died. He was succeeded by Ceausescu
                    who was not really considered to be one of the top heavyweights in the party. He
                    was uneducated, he was not very socially adept, he was definitely from a working
                    class, but he was smarter and tougher than those who were better educated and
                    had better credentials. He out-maneuvered them and became the dictator. That was
                    in '65. Then, of course, in '68 was in effect the defining moment for Romanian
                    relations with the Soviet Union and with the West, and that was the invasion of
                    Czechoslovakia in August. And Romania alone of the Warsaw Pact countries did not
                    participate or support that event. That was a sign of independence that was very
                    welcome to the United States. It was rewarded in any number of ways: first of
                    all by Richard Nixon's visit in 1969, the first Eastern European country that he
                    visited after becoming president and subsequently by a great deal of attention
                    in a lot of different areas including efforts to increase trade, loans, support
                    in becoming a member in the World Bank and other international financial
                    institutions. Romania did a number of things that were ahead of the rest of the
                    Warsaw Pact, and that the U. S. government obviously saw as being helpful and,
                    possibly, opening up the way for fissures within the pact itself. And they
                    recognized the Federal Republic of Germany, the first country to do so back
                    in...I have to check the date...the late '60s I believe that was. Alone among
                    Eastern European countries, in the '67 War between Israel and the Arabs, they
                    didn't break relations. They maintained relations with Israel throughout this
                    whole period. I mentioned Czechoslovakia. Later they were to condemn the Soviet
                    invasion of Afghanistan. So they took a number of helpful steps. And they
                    participated in the '84 Olympics in Los Angeles. They were the only Warsaw Pact
                    country to do so. There were a number of things they did that were welcome to
                    the U. S. government. And my impression always was that we were trying to use
                    this realm of independence as a means of possibly prying, not maybe prying
                    loose, but weakening the bonds within the Warsaw Pact. In the Middle East,
                    because they had relations with both the Arabs and Israel, they played a useful
                    go-between role, and they were always seeking mediator roles in Viet Nam and in
                    various other places. Sometimes they ended up being able to be helpful,
                    sometimes it didn't amount to anything, but they clearly were trying to stake
                    out a place for themselves that was not typical of the Bulgarias or the
                    Czechoslovakias of their time. My own view is that we stuck with them a bit too
                    long because it became evident from the mid to late '80s that the harm that was
                    being done internally through a very rigid and repressive regime outweighed the
                    benefitthe possible benefitof a somewhat independent foreign policy. That
                    conclusion was come to in due course and acted upon. Ceausescu himself declined
                    to seek the extension of MFN because of the humiliations he saw at the annual
                    hearings in order to get the renewal of MFN and all the criticism and heavy
                    abuse from his perspective that resulted from those hearings.</p>

                    I spent most of my time dealing with...I won't say most, but a great deal of my
                    time answering Congressional letters on human rights and also on emigration
                    cases. That was almost a full-time job. I don't remember how many I did a week,
                    but it was 20 to 30 Congressionals a week in many cases. Once a young American
                    of Russian extraction came to my office wanting help with the Romanians to get a
                    visa to go to Romania. It turned out he was American as I said of Russian
                    extraction but was an Old Believer. He lived in Alaska, and he wanted to study
                    to be an Old Believer priest. One of the few Old Believer congregations extant
                    in the world was in the Danube Delta. He sought it and eventually received a
                    visa to go and do on-the-job training to become the head of the “flock” in
                    Alaska which struck me as being a bit unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about your relations with the Romanians
                        in Washington and the two DCM's that they have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. One was for internal use who was usually the highest
                    ranking person in Securitate in the Embassy, the state security. The other,
                    whatever his other affiliations might be, was for dealing with the outside
                    world. The DCM that I got was a man named Boris Rhongetz who was perfectly
                    decent and pleasant to deal with. We had one interesting incident. The Romanians
                    stopped a U. S. pouch that was coming in, claiming it was U. S. firearms, and we
                    refused to open it. We told them that it didn't contain firearms, but we refused
                    to open it because that would be contrary to international law, and they refused
                    to accept it. The only way they could have known what was in it was by X-raying
                    it which was illegal. But to make a long story short, Boris and I negotiated a
                    solution. We promised that there wasn't a firearm in it which was true. What
                    there was in the pouch was something that's called a ramset which is used in
                    construction. Its a pistol-like device which you put against a wall and fire the
                    charge which fastens a nail to the wall. Its used to fasten conduit to concrete
                    walls and things like that. There was apparently construction work going on in
                    the embassy, and one of these was being pouched in. But it couldn't be used to
                    shoot at anyone. It had to be pressed against a surface before the charge could
                    be discharged. We gave assurances thaabsolute assurancethat there were no
                    firearms in the pouch, and the Romanians eventually agreed to allow it in on
                    that basis. What struck me was that even though relations were getting worse,
                    and it was a difficult issue at a low level, there was an effort to find a
                    solution, to be cooperative, to get around the difficulties which had been
                    thrown up, in this case by their bureaucracy. I don't remember if I mentioned
                    Nicu Ceausescu's visit to the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Nicu Ceausescu was the younger son. Ceausescu had two sons and a
                    daughter. Valentin is the oldest and Zoia was the daughter, and then Nicu was
                    the youngest. The older two apparently were not interested in politics, so Nicu
                    became kind of the Crown Prince, the Heir Apparent. An unfortunate choice
                    because he was a notorious playboy, and very heavy drinker who eventually died
                    of cirrhosis of the liver. But he was sent on an official visit to Washington,
                    and Quavering, Romanian embassy officer, came in and said, “Can you please set
                    up some high level meetings for Nicu?” obviously meaning that if we didn't, his
                    job and others were perhaps on the line. So we sent a routine meeting request up
                    to Eagleburger thinking...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...who was deputy secretary...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ...deputy secretary. No, excuse me. He at that time he was
                    undersecretary for political affairs, and he did see most of the high level
                    Eastern Europeans who came through. I honestly thought he would just say
                    politely, “No, I don't have time”, but we got the memo back saying, “Yes, you
                    can set up the meeting.” Of course, the Romanians were delighted. And this was
                    shortly after the incident in which the Korean Airlines plane was shot down in
                    the Far East. It was very interesting and instructional for me to see what
                    Eagleburger did with this meeting. He used it in order to get across our view on
                    the KAL incident and what had happened and what it meant and so forth. Even if
                    Nicu didn't pick up on it, he had an interpreter, and he had a couple of other
                    embassy people there, and he had a report that would go back. He spent about 45
                    minutes with Nicu Ceausescu which most people would have considered to be a
                    waste of time but used it to very good effects under those circumstances. He
                    also used it to get other messages across from his level. Whether they did any
                    good or not is another matter, but that's what diplomacy's all about: letting
                    the other side know what you're up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about the desk officer job? If not,
                        where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Toward the middle of my last year, I was assigned as DCM in Sofia,
                    Bulgaria via foreign language training. This was before DCM committees, and the
                    assignment was made between our office director who, I believe it would have
                    been Dick Holmes at that time. John Davis was the first, and then Dick Holmes
                    was the next. The DAS, Mark Palmer, it was done in-house, so it was a lot easier
                    particularly on severely underbid posts like Sofia where there were about a
                    dozen bidders where half of them were not at grade or had no discernable
                    background. So at the end of my tours as desk officer, I went to language
                    training over at FSI and studied Bulgarian for a year. I did master it fairly
                    well and used it extensively in Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Sofia in the summer of 1985. Who was the
                        ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Ambassador when I arrived was Mel Levitsky, and he was there for over a
                    year. And then there was a gap for a few months, and then Sol Polansky came.
                    That was, of course, a major step forward from a career point of view. I had not
                    had a significant supervisory position up to that point and was thrown into a
                    DCM job in a relatively small embassy. But still, anybody who's been DCM knows
                    the joys and travails of that particular job anywhere, but I thoroughly enjoyed
                    it. Joe Lake was my immediate predecessor, and we overlapped for two days, and
                    he gave me the combination to the safe and showed me where the office men's room
                    was, and said, “I'm here if you need me, but this post is too small for two
                    DCM's.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even for two days!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Even for two days, but you're it! So that was my being thrown off the
                    back of the canoe which I think was the right way to do it, but at the time it
                    seemed a little scary. He had been there for three years, and Mel Levitsky had
                    already been there for well over a year, I believe. Certainly over a year, so he
                    was well settled in, and I was the new guy who had to learn everything from
                    scratch. There were a couple of interesting peoplwell, there were many
                    interesting people at the embassbut the one that went on to the greatest fame
                    was Mike Hayden who was our air attach�. Mike was a major in the Air Force, a
                    very impressive military person who is currently the head of NSA, three star, so
                    he's had a good career. Having worked with him, even traveled with him in
                    country, I can see why. Also, Lyn Dent was the admin officer. We'd served
                    together in Trinidad earlier, and it was a delight to have such an exceptionally
                    competent admin officer for the first year that I was there. There were some
                    other folks: John Beyrle who was a junior officer and is now DCM in Moscow, and
                    some other very capable folks. It was kind of the farm team for Moscow or a
                    place people went to after Moscow. John had come from Moscow, so it was a good
                    team and a pleasure to work with him. Housing was a problem in Sofia. It was
                    some of the worst in Europe at that time. There were Soviet era apartments which
                    were relatively small and not very well built and not very efficient, and they
                    were all the same size. So whether you were Colonel Masterson with his five kids
                    or a single secretary, you got the same size apartment. Interestingly, there was
                    almost no complaining about housing. I attribute that to the fact that there was
                    equal mistreatment for all. At a later time, when I visited Sofia from Bucharest
                    and talked with the DCM there, she told me that housing was the biggest
                    probleone of the biggest problems. By then the market had opened up and some
                    people had very nice houses, and others were still living in the crummy Soviet
                    era apartments, and that lead to problems that we didn't have to face when I was
                    there. My family and I lived in a new building... I'll go back in a moment.
                    About a year before I got there inspectors looked at the chancery and said that
                    if there were a fire, the Marines who were living on the top floor of the
                    chancery building at the time would be incinerated. There would be no way that
                    they could escape. The embassy went quickly to work on finding a new Marine
                    house. The eventual solution that they came up with was a building in a
                    diplomatic enclave on the outskirts of town that was built by the Bulgarians as
                    ambassadors' residences, or at least their idea of what an ambassador's
                    residence should be like. The Marines got one floor at the bottom, and then
                    there was the multi-purpose room which could be used by the embassy for various
                    events and activities. And then there was a DCM apartment on the top floor which
                    had all the quirks and foibles of Bulgarian architecture but was very spacious
                    by local standards and had balconies all the way around and a lovely view of
                    Mount Vitosha. We were on that side of Sofia. It had four bedrooms and was very
                    nice, indeed, in most respects. It was about a half hour from the ski slopes on
                    Mount Vitosha, and about 45 minutes or so from the embassy villa in Borovets, an
                    even better skiing location, and the air was a bit cleaner on the edge of town
                    than it was down in the center of town.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was all right to share a building with the
                        Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>RICKERT: A number of pluses, a few minuses. The Marines were wonderful to our
                    kids who were in grade school at the time, and there was a very strict non-frat
                    policy. These were young guys who were bored. They had very few people to
                    socialize with, and a couple of the Marines were particularly nice to our kids:
                    took them to the zoo, taught them how to play pool and various other things. The
                    only problem, of course, was noise. We had a rule that after 10:00 music had to
                    go down, and for the most part it was observed. It wasn't really a problem. The
                    building itself I thought looked like a modern minimum security correctional
                    facility. It was not exactly attractive or welcoming, but it was a lot better
                    than what a lot of other people had at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad you didn't have to move into the Marines former
                        quarters on the top floor of the chancery! I thought maybe that's what you
                        were going to say!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, no. I might say my biggest concern when I was there was fire because
                    of the Lonetree incident that happened in Moscow. All the security arms in the
                    U. S. government discovered there were security problems in embassies throughout
                    the region. Our chancery waand is as we speastill in a building that has
                    Bulgarian buildings on both sides. The Bulgarian der ja mesigernas, state
                    security, was very aggressive. They bored holes through the walls, and they did
                    all sorts of nasty things. Our security people were concerned about technical
                    and other penetrations, and I was concerned about fire because there was one
                    staircase in the building, straight down the center of the building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: And that was it. And the ambassador's office. The ambassador's and DCM's
                    offices were, I think, on the fourth floor, maybe the fifth floor, but if there
                    were fire down below, it would be a long jump down to the pavement. So these
                    teams that came through were appalled by the security situation and tut-tutted.
                    And ambassadors for years had been complaining about this without any result.
                    But they did do some security upgrades and started getting serious about finding
                    a site for a new chancery which is due to be opened about a year from now. I saw
                    it this past summer when I was on TDY in Bulgaria, and it was something those of
                    us who served back then could only have dreamed about. Its on 10 plus acres,
                    brand new modern earthquake proof...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Decent location in terms of the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Excellent location in terms of the city. It's in the city. It's not
                    downtown, but its not far from the downtown areas, and its in a very good area.
                    I don't know all the details on how we got that site, but I'm sure there are a
                    number of other embassies who are building new chanceries that would like to
                    have something as accessible and as well situated as that one is. It was not a
                    good period in U. S.-Bulgarian relations for several reasons. The approximate
                    cause for the problems was a campaign that was launched by the Zhukov lead
                    Communist regime early in 1985. It started early on, if I recall correctly, to
                    change the names of those who were Turkish to Bulgarian names. The regime
                    decided that these people were all actually Bulgarians who had been turned into
                    Turks by the ottomans during their nearly 500 years of oppression of Bulgaria.
                    So the only decent thing was to turn them back into Bulgarians, and they did
                    this in a very rigorous and oppressive way. They decided what the names of the
                    Turks should be, and they did things like naming Imams “Christo” which is
                    Christ. This is not only an insult of having your name changed but having the
                    principal figure of another religion imposed on you and other things like that.
                    We strongly objected to this and criticized it in public and in private. The
                    second aspect, of course, is that Bulgaria was often seen as the 16th Republic
                    of the Soviet Union and the most slavishly pro-Soviet of all the satellite
                    countries. My view is a little bit different from that of many people in this
                    regard. I can't prove it, but I think the Bulgarians certainly didn't dislike
                    the Russians or the Soviets. They owe them a huge historical debt because of
                    their liberation back in the 1800's with the help of the Russian army, Alexander
                    III I believe it was. But I don't think they especially loved the Russians more
                    than anyone else. Russia, or the Soviet Union, represented to them security, and
                    it represented economic possibility. I think they found that they could get what
                    they wanted by saying the right things and doing the right things at relatively
                    low cost, and it made the Russians happy, and it gave them significant economic
                    advantages, and why not? They really didn't have a whole lot of other choice.
                    They could have resisted to an extent the way Ceausescu did and pay the price,
                    but they ended up living a lot better than the Romanians did, and I think they
                    were being quite opportunistic. They got oil at comicon prices, and refined it,
                    and sold it at world prices, and they had a number of other economic advantages
                    that were well worth voting the right way at the UN all the time and a few other
                    slavish things like that. Although it was startling to see signs of billboards
                    occasionally in Bulgaria that said slava kapay ess ess, “Praise to the Communist
                    Party of the Soviet Union”. You never see that in other Eastern European
                    countries, but in Bulgaria you did. A small price to pay. There wasn't a whole
                    lot going on in U. S.-Bulgarian relations as a result of these two factors.
                    There were certain hints of change in the air. Of course, Gorbachev was in.
                    There was talk of Glasnost and Perestroika. Zhivkov, the Bulgarian dictator, was
                    in his 70's, and it was interesting how he tried to adapt to the new realities
                    in Moscow. Gorbachev came to Bulgaria once, at least once, while I was there.
                    Although one doesn't know what the sources were, the indications from people
                    associated with the visit were that Zhivkov and Gorbachev had not hit it off
                    that well, and it was a real generational difference. There were ideological
                    difference presumably, and Bulgarians put a good show on and claimed everything
                    was just great, but it wasn't. Things weren't as smooth as they might have been.
                    There were small signs, very small signs, that things were changing. In
                    hindsight one can see that there was no resistance and no dissidence of any
                    significance in Bulgaria. In the latter part of my time there was some
                    ecological movements, and that enabled people, even party members, to take
                    stands not entirely in accord with those of the party and state. It was all done
                    on a very high level of maintaining ecology and so forth and never pointed
                    directly at anybody. But it was a sign of independent thinking of action that
                    hadn't been present before. These types of activities eventually turned into the
                    parties, the core of the post-'89 governments. John Whitehead, who was Deputy
                    Secretary of State was commissioned in effect by Secretary Shultz to look after
                    Eastern Europe. In the latter part of my time he came twice to Bulgaria. He used
                    to make a swing through the area, trying to do it every six months. I don't
                    think he managed to keep to that schedule entirely, but I know he came twice.
                    This was interesting because he was, of course, a very charming man. He was not
                    at all unwilling to give a straight message, but he did it very nicely. An
                    interesting little sideline on his visits: He is a cousin of my mother's. I had
                    not really met him before, but he knew who I was. My mother had stayed with his
                    family for vacations when she was in college. She had looked after John's
                    parents when they were elderly and living in the same town in Connecticut and
                    had helped, had seen them, and kind of made sure that they were okay and so
                    forth, which he appreciated. The first time that he came to Bulgaria, he got off
                    the plane, and I was there with the others, and he gave me a big hug and said,
                    “Hello, cousin!” and the Bulgarians were all eyes and ears about that. The
                    second time he came, we were having a very difficult time at the school, and I
                    was Chairman of the School Board. We had a school director and his wife who were
                    both aggressive evangelical Christians. The Bulgarians had told us that they had
                    to go because apparently they were carrying their activities beyond the narrow
                    confines of the foreign community. I didn't often play this kind of game, but by
                    then they knew that Whitehead was related to me. I said, in preparations for the
                    visit when they told me we had to get rid of Mr. and Mrs. Kauffman, I said,
                    “Well, this is an important matter for us, and it would be unfortunate if Mr.
                    Whitehead and I talked to him and he had to raise it with Zhivkov.” And that was
                    the last we ever heard of it, so they finished out their time. You have to use
                    everything at your disposal when you're dealing with that type of situation. One
                    little incident about John Whitehead: One of the times Zhivkov gave a luncheon
                    for him at a place, it was an official palace called the Boyana Palace where
                    they did official entertaining. It was not a residential place. It was a grand
                    barn of a place, a Communist dictator's idea of what a presidential palace
                    should look like. Not on a Ceausescu palace scale, but still some of the same
                    mentality went into it. There was a large table for the luncheon that was about
                    eight feet wide, and Zhivkov was on one side and Whitehead on the other side,
                    and footmen running around with white gloves on. Whitehead had many glasses for
                    the Bulgarian wines and so forth that were to be served which were very good,
                    and as note taker, I was forced to only take a sip of each one, but Mr.
                    Whitehead complimented Mr. Zhivkov on the excellent wine, and Zhivkov
                    respondeI'll never forgesaid, “People tell me that our wines are very good, and
                    I'm sure its true, but he said, “As for me, I can tell the difference between
                    red and white and no further than that.” And when I think of Zhivkov whom I met
                    with on a number of occasions and Ceausescu whom I never met with but saw on a
                    number of occasions, to me a very important difference between the two was that
                    Zhivkov had the ability to laugh at himself which is rare in dictators. He could
                    tell stories like that without feeling embarrassed whereas Ceausescu had to know
                    everything and be all-knowing and all wise. Zhivkov could say, “Oh, actually I
                    prefer beer.” And during the lunch a footman with white gloves came and poured
                    beer out of the can into his glass, crystal glass that he had. It was all rather
                    strange! Another visitor that we had who came twice was Tom Lantos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right. Hungarian-Jewish origin, one of the best informed, interested
                    U.S. congressmen on anything Eastern European, and also one who spent a great
                    deal of time focusing on Jewish issues in that region due to his own family's
                    experience. I don't believe his family was saved by the Swedish diplomat Raul
                    Wallenberg, but I'm pretty sure his wife's family was. Tom Lantos, was a
                    champion of keeping the Wallenberg case alive during the Soviet time when the
                    Soviets claimed they didn't know anything about what was going on, they couldn't
                    find any records. They essentially stonewalled. Lantos, to my Swedish-born
                    wife's chagrin, was a lot more aggressive in pursuing the Wallenberg case than
                    the Swedish government was. In any case, he came twice as it happened both on
                    Easter Sunday which was somewhat inconvenient for some of us on the embassy
                    staff, but he was always a welcome visitor. He met with Zhivkov. I was charg�
                    once, and he was with Ben Gilman who was the senior Republican minority member
                    of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Bill Richardson, who later became
                    Secretary of Energy, was with them.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. So it was an interesting group. They met with Zhivkov, and
                    Tom, whom I greatly admire in most respects, sometimes goes a little bit
                    overboard on the Eastern European flattery. I recall him in a meeting with
                    Zhivkov saying to Mr. Zhivkov that, “You, sir, are one of the great European
                    statesmen of post-World War II,” which caused me to swallow hard, but there was
                    perhaps a little hyperbole there. Tom's interest in Bulgaria was over the fact
                    that the Jewish population of Bulgaria, at the time that Bulgaria was aligned
                    with Nazi Germany, not a single person was sent to death camps from Bulgaria.
                    And there are a number of reasons for this but, in fact, the then king, the
                    church, the governing and opposition parties and intellectuals all resisted
                    this. Germans didn't push it to the limit, but all of the Jews of Bulgaria
                    survived the war. Well, not all survived, but no one was sent away to death
                    camps in Germany, Austria, Poland, or the other places. It was a major
                    accomplishment which Lantos felt was not sufficiently well known. He wanted
                    Bulgarians to know he appreciated and others who had interest in the fate of
                    Jews in the world appreciated what Bulgaria had done to avoid the fate of so
                    many others. The talks with Zhivkov... Zhivkov was rather engaging. It was all
                    done in Bulgarian and then translation which inhibited the spontaneity of
                    conversation, but they had good talks. But Zhivkov did say one thing to Lantos
                    and Gilman and Richardson which struck me very, very strongly at the time. I'm
                    not agreeing with this statement, but I think it says a lot about the Bulgarian
                    mentality. He just volunteered that Bulgaria has no territorial claims on any of
                    its neighbors. This was an interesting point because Macedonia is considered by
                    many Bulgarians to be part of Bulgaria. There's a very complex history, and I
                    think a lot of Bulgarians would like to have had Yugoslav Macedonia as part of
                    Bulgaria. In any case, he made this statement, but he said, and this is the
                    interesting part, “All of our neighbors have territorial claims against us.” To
                    me, that was part of the key to understanding the Bulgarian mentality and why
                    the Soviet Union was so important. The Soviet Union, it seemed to me, was the
                    guarantor of Bulgaria's territorial integrity. If you think that everybody else
                    wants a piece of you, then the best thing you can have is a very big and very
                    powerful protector, and in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria had that and needn't fear
                    Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania, or even the Black Sea under those
                    circumstances which were their neighbors.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: The diplomatic corps, as is usually the case in these situations where
                    contact with locals is very strictly limited, the diplomatic corps was very
                    close. I got to know and deal with all of the NATO and a few other counterparts
                    professionally on a regular basis, and we exchanged information and so forth.
                    Then several of them became very close personal friends. its interesting. I'm
                    sure that a lot of people would disagree, but one piece of advice I got before
                    going to Bulgaria from a former DCM, someone that you know, Roland Kuchel, was
                    that the DCM must be friendly with everybody in this embassy, but “the” friend
                    of no one, and he explained why. He said, “As soon as you become “the” friend of
                    a person or two or three people, it immediately gets people thinking that the
                    DCM favors this person...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...within the embassy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ...within the embassy. He advised strongly... That didn't mean we didn't
                    entertain people from the embassy. We had very good relations with, I think with
                    everybody, but no close personal relationships with anybody except for some of
                    the outsiders. Interestingly, the best friends that we...and not
                    surprisingly...the British DCM, there were two of them. The second one we served
                    with together in Romania and knew him, Mike Frost, from before. The Turkish DCM,
                    Olive Kiddush, was very, very competent and nice and a very professional
                    diplomat. We got to know him personally and went on picnics and did things like
                    that. Interestingly, the first French DCM was a very good personal friend which
                    isn't always the case. Mr. Jubierre, Mark Jubierre. He was a former French
                    paratrooper who had been a French military attach� in Moscow. He then joined the
                    Foreign Service and was, I wouldn't say uncriticayou don't want uncritical
                    friendbut he was a real friend of the United States and was very eager to work
                    closely with Americans as he had done in his ,military capacity in Moscow. I
                    wish there were more such relationships because that was unusual. Had good
                    relations with the Yugoslavs. The name of the Yugoslav Ambassador, DCM rather,
                    escapes me at the moment., but he was a Macedonian, and he and I have no other
                    common language than Bulgarian and Macedonian. That's what I found in practical
                    terms how close the two languages are because my Bulgarian was far from perfect,
                    but I could understand if he'd been speaking in Bulgarian and Macedonian 10%
                    less, and he could understand my Bulgarian perfectly. They're very close. Some
                    differences back then and a few different words, but they're almost like
                    dialects in the same tongue.</p>

                        want to say anything about the foreign minister, the foreign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. The foreign minister was Mladenov who had been foreign minister for
                    many years. He was not somebody that we saw frequently but made efforts to be
                    friendly toward the end of Mel Levitsky's stay and beyond. He was very frank to
                    say if there was anything important that he couldn't make a decision on although
                    he was probably the senior foreign minister in Europe at the time in terms of
                    length of service. He had a very bright and sometimes aggressive and sometimes
                    charming deputy foreign minister named Lyuben Gotsev who was well known by
                    Americans from earlier. Could be acerbic, could be ingratiating. I had some
                    dealings with Gotsev on a quasi-personal/official matter twice while I was
                    there. I was stopped by militia and treated in a way that wasn't appropriate for
                    a foreign diplomat. The first time was when I was going to a city in South
                    Central Bulgaria. We had received a diplomatic note from the foreign ministry.
                    This city had been in what we called the “PRA”, Permanently Restricted Area.
                    About 20% of the country was off-limits to foreigners, most of it the border
                    areas. This city had been opened, so Orthodox Easter Sunday my family and I, my
                    mother who was visiting at the time, went to the city, went to some Easter
                    services on the way and went to the city, I don't recall the name. We were
                    driving around, and we got stopped by the police, the “militia” as they were
                    called, and the militia man was perfectly polite, but he said, “You're in
                    restricted area. You're not allowed to be here, and I have to call my boss to
                    see what to do about it.” I said, “Well, I have a note from the foreign ministry
                    which I had carefully brought with me in Bulgarian saying that this city was
                    open and could be visited by foreigners, and I'm just doing what's permitted by
                    the note that we have from your foreign ministry.” He said, “Well, let me go and
                    check.” He went back, and he obviously was in radio contact with somebody and
                    came back and said, “Yes, its true that this city is now open, but it's only
                    open up to that street which is behind you, and you've gone into the forbidden
                    part of the city, and we won't do anything this time, but you'd better leave.”
                    So, we left, of course, and I didn't say anything to the Bulgarians about it
                    that time. We did a lot of entertaining in our apartment which was beyond public
                    transportation, and we had a maid and a cook who could not get home afterwards.
                    So I would usually take the official car which was parked there where I lived.
                    The embassy garage was there along with Marine housing and other things, and
                    drive these two ladies home. One of them lived in a workers quarter and a large
                    black American car with diplomatic plates were not normally seen in that area. I
                    dropped her off, anSvetanka Sposova was her namand she went into her apartment,
                    and then I was taking the cook home to her apartment, and the police came over
                    and were fairly polite but started asking a lot of questions: “What are you
                    doing here? Why?” and so forth, and they wanted my documentation and everything.
                    I was polite as long as I could, and I finally said, “Look, you have no reason
                    to be asking these questions, and I'm not going to answer any more, let me go,”
                    and they did. What I didn't know was the cook who was sitting in the front seat
                    beside me had written down the number from the police car. I went to see Gotsev
                    and said, “Look. You say that you want better relations, but you're treating the
                    American charg� in a way that doesn't indicate a desire for better relations.” I
                    told him about both of these incidents, and I said, “I have not reported these
                    to Washington,” which was true. I said, “If it happens again, I will, and we'll
                    make a real stink about it.” He said, “Oh, thank you! Thank you for not
                    reporting it!” It didn't happen again. But the state security was, indeed, very
                    aggressive, and there were many incidents involving people in the embassy, some
                    of it of the calling card nature of just letting us know that they'd been there.
                    One of our employees had a teenage daughter, and the parents went away for the
                    weekend, and the daughter was in the apartment alone. She went to go someplace
                    to a party or something, and came back. At that time teenagers and young adults
                    had their music on cassettes, and someone had come with something like we're
                    using here with an ice-pick like implement and had destroyed all of their pop
                    music cassettes in the locked apartment. Nothing else was touched. Nothing was
                    stolen. It was just a little notice that, “We can come whenever we want and do
                    whatever we want, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.” Another thing at
                    the time was Chernobyl. Chernobyl occurred, and it was particularly important in
                    Bulgaria because Bulgaria in Kosovela has a similar power plant north on the
                    Danube, some distance north of Sofia. There was great concern within the
                    American community and, as well, within the Western diplomatic community that if
                    Chernobyl can go, what about Kosovela? Fortunately, the flow of the
                    radioactivity from Kosovela for reasons of air currents and so forth, was to the
                    north, and we didn't get much in Bulgaria although we were warned against eating
                    certain products: sheep, cheese, because sheep graze very close to the ground,
                    and if there was any radioactivity it would be ingested and turned up in the
                    cheese.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about Chernobyl and what it meant to your
                        embassy in Sofia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: An expert came out and, interestingly, they went up to the vicinity of
                    Kosovela, the Bulgarian plant, and took readings to see if there were any signs
                    of leakage and radioactivity from the Kosovela plant. And then they came back
                    and took readings for comparative purposes in Sofia. They found the readings
                    higher in Sofia than they were outside the Kosovela plant which led us to joke
                    that there was an underground nuclear power plant in the heart of downtown
                    Sofia. The danger was not what was happening at the time. The danger was shown
                    that after the explosion of Chernobyl that any reactor of that type posed a
                    risk, and people had a new appreciation for the difficulties that could ensue.
                    One of the things that Eastern European dictators used to do and which Zhivkov
                    still did was to have an annual diplomatic excursion. In some places there were
                    hunts. Zhivkov did not take people hunting. He went to a different town each
                    year. I was charg� and went on a trip to Blagoevgrad in about May '87. I did a
                    reporting cable on it, and it gives the whole atmosphere in the way its done and
                    how they stage-managed these events. It was one of the most interesting things
                    that I did in Bulgaria because you actually got to see the leadership up close,
                    not in a formalistic kind of “on top of the mausoleum watching the troops” type
                    of situation. So that was well worth doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get quite a bit of travel within the country to
                        the extent that you were able? There were some of the areas that were
                        restricted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yeah. Bulgaria is a relatively small country. Due to restrictions within
                    the United States on East European diplomats, according to which they had to
                    give 48 hours notice to OFM to travel certain distances, the Bulgarians who had
                    not had restrictions on us before, aside from the permanently restricted areas,
                    slapped similar restrictions on us. So the common mode of travel in Bulgaria was
                    day trips because you didn't have to report that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have to ask permission in advance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. You could literally go from one end of the country within
                    a day, in a very long day. In fact, I did so at one time with Major Mike Hayden.
                    We went on a very aggressive defense attach� excursion. We went up to the
                    northeast and back in the same day. I got to see first-hand how the really good
                    people in that side of diplomatic life performed. We did a lot of small trips.
                    There are many monasteries in Bulgaria. The country is beautiful. Its
                    mountainous. There are picturesque villages. Our cook was from a village called
                    Koprivshtitsa which is a restored village. It's a historic village, and when we
                    were there it seemed to be about 80% restored, and the rest was being gradually
                    restored. Her mother lived there, and interestingly, that was the only Bulgarian
                    home that we ever visited. Only one Bulgarian ever came to our apartment
                    privately in three years although my wife and I both spoke quite decent
                    Bulgarian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only one came privately, but you entertained others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, we entertained, and invitations went to the foreign ministry and
                    were checked by the state security, and determinations were made who could
                    accept and who couldn't. When I was charg� the turnout would be better on a
                    higher level, and when I was DCM it was scaled back in accordance with my lower
                    status. It was not possible to entertain. It was virtually impossible for an
                    American to entertain privately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on one occasion you did extend directly an invitation,
                        and it was accepted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>RICKERT: It was interesting. At the end of our time there, we met a Bulgarian
                    sculptor who obviously had a green light to meet with foreigners. We had him do
                    busts of our two children and got to know him a bit. Indeed, I saw him last
                    summer when I was back, and he's become a great friend of Ambassador Pardew. We
                    talked about Balkan art, and I mentioned to him that we had some paintings by
                    probably Romania's most famous painter of the 20th Century, a man named Corneliu
                    Baba. We were close personal friends of him, and we have several paintings of
                    his. Chokov, the sculptor, said he would love to see the paintings. We said,
                    “They're in our apartment, and we're leaving in two weeks, and if you would like
                    to see them, you have to come there because that's where they are.” He hemmed
                    and hawed and mulled over it, and he said he would get back to us, and he did.
                    He came for coffee, and he saw the paintings and left. That was the one case of
                    a non-channeled invitation to a Bulgarian who came to our house. To show the
                    mentality there, my wife did a lot of shopping herself. She spoke quite good
                    Bulgarian, and she would go to the markets and talk with the market ladies and
                    get fresh fruit and vegetables and so forth. Two incidents happened that were, I
                    think, revealing. Once she arrived in the market, in the summer at some point,
                    and found a rather nice load of wild blueberries for sale. She talked to the
                    lady and said, “How much do you have here?” She said, “I have eight kilos,” and
                    my wife said, “I'll take them all.” And the woman said, “No, you can't have them
                    all.” And Gerd said, “Why, don't you want to sell them? She said, “Yes, but if
                    you buy them all, there won't be any left for anybody else.” My wife said,
                    “Okay. Well, could you bring more blueberries another time?” She said, “Yes.”
                    So, we set up an arrangement whereby she would bring a supply. We bought usually
                    over 50 kilos of blueberries a year and froze them. Blueberries freeze very
                    nicely, and they are full of iron and all sorts of good stuff. We ate them on
                    cereal which made the ultra-UHT milk taste less unpleasant than it did
                    otherwise, and we could get the kids to take their supply of milk that way.
                    Another time she wanted to buy tomatoes. Bulgarian tomatoes are wonderful and
                    really outstanding. She wanted to get large tomatoes in order to fill them. She
                    asked the lady if she could have a kilo of large tomatoes, and the woman said,
                    “You get what you get. I fish 'em up, and if they're large, they're large; if
                    they're small, they're small.” And she explained, “Please, I just want large
                    ones,” and so forth and so on. This discussion went on, and there was a line
                    behind my wife, and she was arguing with this woman. The Bulgarians behind her
                    said, “Can't you see this nice foreign lady has a good reason why she wants the
                    large tomatoes, and she speaks our language, and she's being polite? Give her
                    what she wants! Don't be so difficult!” So she had the others in the line
                    probably wanting to get their tomatoes as well and being held up, but they were
                    on her side which was interesting. The woman grudgingly gave mostly large
                    tomatoes and a few small ones, so she didn't cave in completely. It was another
                    indication of the local mentality.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>One of the things, going back to the Turkish issue: First of all, the Bulgarians
                    claimed there were no Turks there. We were fortunate in that the head of our
                    political econ section, Oscar Clyatt, had served in Turkey. He spoke very good
                    Turkish and also liked to get in a car and drive around. He went to Turkish
                    areas, and he was usually followed but occasionally, without going through any
                    special effort, shook free. He would go to the villages and sit down at a coffee
                    house and order coffee in Turkish. When he did that, people would start talking
                    with him. He provided the first in-country verification that people in these
                    villages, whatever the Bulgarians were saying, they considered themselves to be
                    Turkish. I mean, there were refugees who had gone to Turkey who said this, but
                    Bulgarians said, “Well, they just want their refugee status and Turkey won't
                    keep them if they say they're Bulgarian.” Oscar did this on several occasions,
                    and Oscar was a difficult personality in some ways, but he did such a good job
                    in this area that I put him up for the HUMINT (Human Intelligence) Collector
                    Award which he got. I think it was well deserved because he did establish
                    something that was important in U. S. policy and bilateral relations at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: One time we went to a place called Bankya which is outside of Sofia.
                    There was a handicrafts fair there which we attended. There was a cartoonist
                    there who was selling his works there, and he had a cartoon there that I liked
                    called “Glas Nost.” It had a picture of a rather large man and a French
                    horn-like musical instrument with a very large bell. He had it inverted, so he
                    was obviously shouting into the bell, the large end of the horn, and you could
                    see strong lines going there. At the mouthpiece end there were these little
                    lines coming out. I talked with him and said, “I'm an ignorant foreigner, and I
                    don't understand your politics here. What does this mean?” He said, “Oh,” he
                    said. “Where Glas Nost is concerned, there's a lot more noise at the source than
                    there is at the other end.” I said, “That's interesting. I'd like to buy it. How
                    much do you charge for it?” He said, “Well, I usually get about 120, 125 leva
                    for my cartoons,” which was close to $150, and this was not in a frame or
                    anything. I knew I had 20 leva in my pocket, so I reached into my wallet and
                    opened it up, and I looked, and you could see there were only 20 leva. I said,
                    “No, I'm very sorry, I can't buy it. I only have 20 leva.” “Sold!” So I
                    treasured that one. He had another cartoon which I didn't buy because I only had
                    the 20 leva, but it was a comment on the medical profession with a doctor
                    sitting behind a table something like this looking in a file. There's a patient
                    opposite him who is wrapped from head to toe. You can't even tell if its male or
                    female, but bandaged entirely. The doctor without looking up said, “Please take
                    off your clothes.” Interestingly, the Glas Nost cartoon did appear in the party
                    daily, the “Rabota Jisko Dello.” So there were some small signs of Glas Nost.
                    There was another cartoon that I remember which perhaps presaged things to come.
                    It was drawings set up like an equation. The equation was: state materials +
                    state labor + state land = private villa. It was a comment on corruption which
                    was existing even at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anticipating more to come.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Of course, it was relatively small scale at that time. The Marines
                    presented a number of problems, as nice and as delightful as they were in many
                    regards. One of the few recreations they had was skiing, and they would go off
                    to Vitosha. Most of them had never skied before, and with the folly of youth and
                    the daring-do of typical Marines, they would just get on skis and head down the
                    hills. They were a sight to behold. We had a couple of broken legs, and they had
                    to be warned off from skiing because we would have had insufficient watch
                    standards because of their limited state. Another time some of our Marines were
                    engaged in a fight in a bar by some Bulgarians who obviously knew what they were
                    doing. The men handled the Marines. Beat them up pretty good and pretty well.
                    Interestingly, the proof to me that it was all prearranged was that there was
                    one black Marine in this Group, John Cochrahan, who was the special friend of my
                    son and daughter. He played Monopoly with them and did things. Very, very nice
                    man from Louisiana. He was one of the terrors on the slopes, by the way. Very
                    athletic, but skiing requires more than athleticism. The white Marines were
                    being pummeled by these Bulgarian thugs, toughs. Two of them just pinned
                    Cochrahan to the wall. Didn't hurt him but didn't let him get into the fight. It
                    said to me that they wanted to teach the marines a lesson but they didn't want
                    to give anyone an excuse for saying it was racial or racist. After the Lonetree
                    affair in Moscow, each one of our Marines was taken out to Vienna or Frankfurt,
                    I've forgotten where, and polygraphed. It turned out that several of them had
                    relations with Bulgarian girls, so they disappeared very quickly which I can
                    understand. The one thing that was sad to me was that the brightest and sharpest
                    of the Marines at that time apparently had not broken any rules except that he
                    hadn't told on his fellow Marines, so he was kicked out as well. I'm not sure
                    that the ones that were sent were any better than ones that left. It was a very
                    tough case. The Lonetree case really did shake up all the embassies in the
                    region because of the allegations which never were fully proved that Sgt.
                    Lonetree in Moscow let Russians run through the communications center and other
                    places in the embassy; and that he'd had some sort of an improper relationship
                    with a Russian woman which I think is well established, but I'm not sure what
                    has been proven about the more dramatically serious allegations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Marines on the ski slope and obviously
                        your family enjoyed it as well. Was that a place where you would meet
                        Bulgarians, or was it pretty much the American international community that
                        would mostly be there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's a very good question because its one of the few places where we
                    had free and uninhibited conversations with Bulgarians. If you're riding in a
                    ski lift, there are two of you. There's no fear of microphones or any other kind
                    of listening device, and you get off at the other end and one goes one way and
                    another goes another way, and that's it. We did have some very interesting
                    conversations in those circumstances. But those, unfortunately, were the
                    exception rather than the rule. There was a great deal of fear, apparently,
                    among Bulgarians. We met another sculptor that we tried to get to know and
                    arranged to visit him in his studio. There was nothing clandestine at all about
                    this. When we got there we found that the guy was almost shivering. We met him
                    through the Hungarian ambassador who was a very nice man and interested in the
                    arts. He said, “You should get to know this guy. I know him, “ so we tried. When
                    we met with him in his studio, he had a functionary from the ministry of culture
                    there. We asked if it would be possible to buy something from him, and he
                    referred us to a local gallery that carried his works. We found out later that
                    he had gotten in trouble earlier in his career by consorting with foreigners. As
                    to the difficulty of dealing with Bulgarians, it was interesting. We got to know
                    most of the Warsaw Pact ambassadors and DCM's quite well, and most of them were
                    very friendly. They complained that their students had great difficulty in
                    establishing any kind of friendship or rapport with Bulgarians, so it wasn't
                    only Americans, apparently. Another sign that things were starting to unravel a
                    little bit was I remember getting a little diplomatic note from the Romanian
                    embassy criticizing Hungary over some interfering in Romania's internal affairs
                    on the ethnic Hungarian minority. That would have been unheard of earlier. The
                    remaining DCM with whom we became quite friendly used to tell us things that we
                    couldn't get from any other source about what was going in Warsaw Pact meetings.
                    Not state secrets, but he said Bulgarians were trying to get them to support
                    Turkish name chains campaign, and none of the other Warsaw Pact countries would
                    do so which resulted in some, I think, useful reporting. HToman Baloshoya was
                    his namhe wanted us to know about this and was happy to pass along the dirt on
                    the Romanians. The Romanians and Bulgarians, they weren't sworn enemies, but
                    they don't have the best relations. At the end of my tour there, I mentioned
                    earlier that I did all of my business with Bulgarians in Bulgarian. Just as I
                    was leaving Bill Montgomery was arrivinmy successoand Sol Polanski gave a very
                    nice luncheon to sort of “hail and farewell.” There were several Bulgarian
                    foreign ministry people there. After the luncheon two of them took me aside and
                    said, “Mr. Rickert, we notice that you have always spoken Bulgarian with us in
                    all of your meetings, and we know that isn't easy, and we appreciate it. We want
                    you to know that the Soviets never speak Bulgarian with us.” I thought all that
                    work at FSI and elsewhere has done something because that was... I was going to
                    say it was the best compliment but it was the only compliment I ever got from a
                    Bulgarian.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: One other little thing. Mel Levitsky left about February '87, and the
                    week that he left the State magazine came out with Sofia as post of the month.
                    The embassy had collected a bunch of photographs. In those days the post of the
                    month was mostly photographs and very little text. Local scenes and then embassy
                    activities. John Beyrle, now DCM of Moscow, took most of the pictures. I took
                    two or three of them, and he took the rest. He said to us the summer before it
                    took a while to collect these pictures but he would like to take a picture of my
                    wife and me and our two kids in front of the National Theater which was just
                    around the corner from the embassy. So we did that one day, and that picture
                    went in with all the rest for the editors to select. Much to our surprise and, I
                    have to admit, delight, when the State magazine came out, the Rickert family was
                    on the cover. Many people have asked over the yearI usually had it hanging in my
                    office or something like thaand they'd say, “Is that the DCM residence in the
                    background?” I'd say, “No, it's the state national theater and considerably
                    greater than any residence in Sofia.” It says in Bulgarian Kifan Baza State
                    Theater, but that's another matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. You were the cover!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The cover family. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Where did you go from there? That would have
                        been the summer of '88.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Summer of '88 I went to PER/FCA at that point as head of the assignments
                    division for European and IO officers. Two years in that job. First exposure to
                    personnel as a function in the department. We had an outstanding director at
                    that time and deputy director in Jim Tull and Ray Ewing who was a delight to
                    work for as was Clyde Taylor who came after. I don't think there's a whole lot
                    to say about the time there. I thought it was an outstanding group of people
                    that we worked with. We worked in a very collegial way, most of us doing
                    something we'd never done before and would never do again, so there was a lot to
                    learn about mechanics and so forth. George Vest was the Director General when I
                    started. I was particularly impressed by the way he dealt with the assignment
                    process. He used his prerogative rarely, but occasionally, to overturn panel
                    decisions. When he did so, in my experience at least, he called the officers who
                    were involved in the decision proposing and opposing to his office and heard
                    them out. Then he explained why he decided what he decided. One might not have
                    agreed with what he came up with, but it was a sign to me not only of great
                    professionalism but great personal decency to not just by fiat which he could
                    easily have done say, “Okay, I don't like this assignment, I'm going to overturn
                    it.” I don't think that's always been the case. I'm not casting aspersions on
                    his successor, at Perkins, but that method did not continue under Ed Perkins. I
                    was impressed in my time there how little political involvement there was in the
                    assignments. I felt that the vast majority of the assignments were done
                    according to the rules and without outside influences, and that was very
                    reassuring. The decisions weren't always the best or the right ones, but they
                    were arrived at through a process that was fair and under the rules that
                    existed, very conscientiously followed by all the people working in the
                    system.</p>
                <p>I think I might just finish up by saying how I ended up leaving because it will
                    lead into the next part which is my assignment as DCM to Romania. I so enjoyed
                    being DCM in Sofia that I really did want to do it again. I think I bid on eight
                    different jobs in my final year. I hadn't even a nibble from anyone on any of
                    them. Two or three of them were stretches which was understandable, but
                    others... One was Dublin which had 97 bidders that year. I don't know how they
                    ended up picking somebody for that job. It's an indication of the vagaries of
                    the assignment process because it was very late in the cycle, and I had nothing.
                    It's better to be in Washington with nothing than to be overseas with nothing,
                    but I had no prospects. All of a sudden two DCM jobs became open. One was in
                    Zambia where the then-DCM had moved down to South Africa to be DCM. The other
                    was Bucharest where Larry Napper had curtailed to two years. Larry had gone
                    through the 1989 revolution, and for personal reasons wanted to do a two year
                    tour instead of three. Interestingly, it had come up before panel, and I had
                    voted against it because it was a three-year tour, and he really had...</p>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>RICKERT: ...against the curtailment, and it was not allowed. Larry then did what
                    was entirely right and proper. He wrote to the DG and explained in greater
                    detail what the reasons were. They were personal and were not of the nature that
                    one would want to have necessarily discussed in a large setting. The DG agreed,
                    and Larry was curtailed. No one would ever doubt Larry's commitment or
                    dedication or work ethic or anything else. That was not the issue. It was really
                    an issue of whether the three-year assignment rule should be upheld or not, and
                    the DG correctly ruled that in this case it should not. Two years with the
                    revolution with a very nice but clueless political ambassador was like four
                    years in the normal post, so he did his time. Anyway, I bid on both jobs and
                    quickly found myself on the short list. And I say, not entirely with false
                    modesty, but if you become a candidate for a job late in the cycle, competition
                    isn't as good because all the good people have already been snapped up. I spoke
                    with both ambassadors. I said quite honestly, I said, “If either of you wants
                    me, I will be...” That's it. I preferred Romania, but Zambia would have been
                    very interesting and something new and different for me, and I was more
                    concerned to be convincing that I was ready, willing and able to go where
                    needed. Green, in Bucharest, didn't make up his mind very quickly, and I got a
                    tip from the office deputy director in the EU. He said, “Well, Green is really a
                    hands-on people person, and if you are really interested in this job, you should
                    offer and go to meet him in person, because he doesn't know you, and he is
                    unlikely to pick somebody that he hasn't met.” I gulped because financially it
                    wasn't the plushest period in my life or my family's life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He was in Bucharest. I wrote to him and said I know you want to
                    interview your candidates, and you're there and I'm here, and I'm willing to
                    come to Bucharest or anyplace else in Europe at my expense to interview. He told
                    me later that that was one of the things that... He said, “No. I know how much
                    money you people make, and that is too much. We'll do it on the phone.” We had
                    two long interviews about an hour each on the phone during which he did 95% of
                    the talking. He decided that I was a brilliant candidate on the basis of his
                    extensive conversation. He told me later that my willingness to come at my own
                    expense showed that I was really motivated and helped to balance in my favor
                    because there were a few other good candidates. It did work out, I didn't have
                    to go, and it ended up being eventually a... I had a bridge assignment in
                    between when I did go with Ambassador Green. We got on very well and enjoyed
                    each other and worked well together.</p>

                        time, Jonathan, discussed how you got your assignment as DCM in Bucharest,
                        but we didn't really talk about the bridge assignment, the one year you had
                        before you took up that position in 1991. Why don't you talk a little bit
                        about what you did for that year besides refreshed your Romanian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I did that, indeed. I had a year to fill in before going to Romania and
                    already having the language, it was not necessary to do a full course. I ended
                    up looking for a job on the Hill, one year detail to Congress, and ended up
                    working with Senator Bob Packwood on his staff. That was a very good and useful
                    experience in a number of ways. Just being on the Hill is a useful experience
                    for any Foreign Service officer because Congress is so important in all that we
                    do. Having a better understanding of what they do up there and how they do it
                    and what their priorities are and how they look at us are useful for any FSO and
                    particularly for more senior ones. Packwood, as you'll recall, was a Republican
                    who was very liberal on social issues and fairly conservative on natural and
                    fiscal monetary issues. He was not, in fact, terribly interested in foreign
                    affairs with the exception of Israel. He had a long background of supporting
                    Israel. He had one staffer who did foreign affairs and essentially Israel
                    matters, and I did the other things. Oregon, which I visited but don't know
                    well, strikes me as being an interestingly quirky state. At that timthis was
                    '90, '9people there were very worked up about our El Salvador policy although
                    there were very few Hispanics in Oregon, but it was a moral and political issue
                    for them. Among other things I received a number of these delegations in the
                    name of the senator and heard their polite but insistent pleas for support for
                    change in U. S. policy. One of the other duties I had was Senator Packwood had
                    been previously chairman of the senate commerce committee and was still a member
                    but often didn't go to the meetings. I would go and take notes and keep him
                    briefed on what was going on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he a member of the finance committee?</hi>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>RICKERT: He was chairman of the finance committee then, and he had his own people
                    there to back him up in that role, and I was not at all involved in that. There
                    were a lot of interesting things that happened. Of course, during the time that
                    I was there, there was a vote in the senate on the first Gulf War resolution,
                    and I have to say that Packwood was really torn. His fellow senator from Oregon,
                    also Republican, also liberal, Mark Hatfield, was a dyed-in-the-wool pacifist
                    who opposed any and all military intervention anywhere. His position was
                    relatively easy, but Packwood I think would like to have abstained if he could.
                    He talked to me. He talked to lots of other people and asked what he should do.
                    As you know very well, when you're working on the Hill, you're not working for
                    the state department, you're working for the senator or congressman or
                    committee. You're not an agent of the executive branch on the hill. He asked me
                    what I thought, and I said, “Senator Packwood, I really don't see that you have
                    any choice but to vote for the administration's resolution. Its topic, and
                    you're Republican, and its a Republican administration, Its a clear-cut case of
                    invasion, and I don't see that you have any other option.” That's in the end how
                    he did vote after a lot of agonizing. Not that it was because of my advice. I'm
                    sure he sought many peoples' advice including those who dealt with the political
                    situation in Oregon, but it was fun to be asked. Another issue on which he asked
                    my advice was on a bill that was introduced by Representative Joe Moakley from
                    Massachusetts on El Salvador. I don't remember the details of the bill, but the
                    administration was opposed to it, and the senator was seeking advice on how he
                    should vote. I remember telephoning the State Department two or three times
                    saying, “I'm working with Senator Packwood, and he'd like to know what the
                    administration's case is against this bill. Could you please give me some
                    ammunition?” They never responded. On the face of it the bill made sense to me,
                    I advised him to vote for it. Again, not because of my advice but after looking
                    at a number of factors and, I suspect, very little down-side in Oregon, he did
                    vote for the Democratic bill in that case.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right. I think the bill was one that he didn't see any reason to oppose.
                    There was no resistance to it back in his home state, so he went along with it.
                    One of the things I learned was that there are a lot of bills that are
                    irrelevant to a particular senator or representative where they can go along
                    with their party or not, as they choose, and with very little fallout or
                    difficulty. And then there are key votes where they really have to stand up and
                    be counted, and those are the ones that they agonize over particularly if they
                    have personal qualms or doubts.</p>

                <p>One of the positive experiences that related to my next assignment in Romania,
                    incidentally, was a friend of mine who works for an NGO in Washington was kind
                    of hosting King Michael I of Romania and his wife, Queen Anne and Princess
                    Margareta and a couple of others. My friend called up and asked if there would
                    be any possibility of my getting into the Senate dining room for lunch. I talked
                    to senior staffers, and there is a form that you go through and fill out a
                    letter where the senator's signature is forged onto. There were, by the way,
                    three authorized forgers in his office who sign. The signatures were done with a
                    broad tip felt pen, and they had it down. So each one was individual, and none
                    of them was done by the senator, at least of the correspondence and the routine
                    stuff. They happily signed, and King Michael and his family were able to have
                    bean soup in the dining room and, incidentally, ran into the then-Czech foreign
                    minister who was there for another purpose and had a nice chat with him in the
                    dining room. That was very pleasant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the king and his family living at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>RICKERT: He was living for many, many years outside of Lausanne in Switzerland.
                    He had been active in dealing with Romanian immigrae groups of one sort of
                    another, and was even more so in the early '90s. He came to the States and gave
                    talks and did other things, raised money and other very un-kingly types of
                    activities. A very nice man, and it was a pleasure to meet him. He didn't want
                    to speak Romanian, by the way. He spoke English with me. Whenever there was a
                    question on a foreign policy issue usually on the phone, it usually got sent to
                    me. Often letters as well. I answered correspondence. I remember one person
                    calling from Oregon who was irate about some issue and said, “You youngsters up
                    there on the Hill, you don't know anything. You have no experience at all.” I
                    said to him, “Wait a minute. I'm sitting here in a room with six people, and I'm
                    over 50 myself, and the lady here is 55, and another lady is early 50's.” There
                    was a man in his early 40's, and there was one young woman who in her mid 20's,
                    but out of six, there was only one under 40. He had the good grace to laugh when
                    I gave him the ages of the people who were in the one room there. That was
                    fairly standard for that staff. They weren't a lot of young kids. Maybe on the
                    House side there are more very young people, but it was a fairly seasoned staff.
                    Romanians knew that I was going to be going there as DCM, and I remember they
                    included me on a breakfast with some Hill staffers at the Romanian embassy. The
                    ambassador was a man named Virgil Constantinescu whom I've known slightly during
                    my first tour. He was America's desk officer at that time. He hosted Adrian
                    Severin who was deputy prime minister and Ujenne Dizhmaresky who was another
                    minister. He was minister of economy at one of the economic posts. There were a
                    number of Hill staffers. I was fairly quiet, but they were very skeptical of
                    Romania's changes since the Communist regime had fallen. I remember one of them
                    asking Severin, who later became a good friend of mine, “I understand that
                    there's still a lot of influence of the secura parte, the Secret Police, the
                    old, not as a living organization, but as people who had been part of that
                    organization, were prominent in the new government. What can you say to that?”
                    Instead of giving the expected Romanian line of, “Oh, its exaggerated, its not
                    really the case,” and so forth and so on, he said, “Yes, it is a problem, but
                    we're trying to deal with it, but here's no easy solution to it.” I thought,
                    “Hmmm, I think I am going back to a Romania that would be somewhat different
                    from the one that I left because any admission of a shortcoming or failure was
                    unthinkable at earlier times.” You mentioned that I was probably working on my
                    Romanian. Actually, FSI was still in Rosslyn at the time, and I had an
                    arrangement whereby I would go to Rosslyn for an hour each morning before
                    classes started, and Carmen Tudrah, who was still teaching Romanian here and
                    Ninja Falaty who was retired would take turns trying to bring me up to speed in
                    an hour. Then I'd get on the Metro and go over to the Hill. They were extremely
                    helpful in expunging the Bulgarian which was still uppermost in my mind at that
                    time. I had been away from Romania nearly 20 years and had learned some other
                    languages in between. Although the Romanian had been well established when I
                    left, it needed some resuscitation which they were very helpful in providing. I
                    think those were the main things that came out of that period. It was a very
                    useful and worthwhile experience. A little historical footnote is, as everyone
                    knows, Senator Packwood came to grief subsequently over behavior that he
                    allegedly had been engaged in with female staffers and others. I'm not, of
                    course, saying that it didn't happen, but there was no evidence whatsoever of
                    any hanky panky going on during my time there. I think that very often when one
                    goes into an office, one can sense that there's kind of an atmosphere that
                    things weren't quite right, and that was not the case. It was a happy,
                    productive office, and the staff was very loyal. They were, I'd say, about 85%
                    female, but it wasn't a load of Fanny Foxes or other beautiful bimbos who were
                    just there because of their appearance. Everyone that I knew on the staff was
                    serious and substantive, and it was an ordinary mix of ages and sizes and
                    shapes. Whatever happened later, there was nothing that I saw or experienced
                    that led me to believe that there was something amiss.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Most of them had an Oregon connection of some sort or another. The other
                    foreign policy guy with whom I became very friendly was from Washington State,
                    so he was an honorary Oregonian. I was taught on my first day that the proper
                    pronunciation of the state is “Or'-eh-gun”, and that was important in being able
                    to answer the phone and deal with the folks from the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably learned the proper pronunciation of the main

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes! That came up less often than the state name, but still it was a
                    good experience and one that I was happy to have at that time that needed to be
                    filled in as useful and productive a way as possible. I did call on a number of
                    the staffers on the committees who had an interest in Romania and made some
                    contacts that were useful in that way. It wasn't only working with Packwood but
                    that, of course, was the main purpose for being there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. Of course, Tom Lantos has for many years had a broad interest in
                    the whole region and, as I mentioned earlier, he came twice to Bulgaria while I
                    was DCM. He and his chief staffer, Bob King, who in an earlier life worked for
                    Radio Free Europe, actually wrote a history of the Romanian Communist party. He
                    was a Romanian specialist. Bob and his wife Kay Atkinson were both very
                    interested as was Tom. Then there was a mixed bag of others for various reasons.
                    There was a congresswoman from ConnecticuI think her first name was Barbara
                    Kennelly who for reasons that weren't immediately apparent, was very interested
                    in Romania. When you got to know the situation you found that her daughter was
                    married to a Romanian, and she took a lot of interest.</p>

                        generally. Kennelly's father was John Bailey, a leader of the Democratic
                        National Committee at one point and a very active democratic politician for
                        many years.</hi>

                <p>RICKERT: I don't know how many years she was in the House, but eventually she ran
                    for the Senate and did not win. I haven't seen her name since then, so I don't
                    know what she's been up to. I found her interesting and interested where Romania
                    is concerned</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK. So you went to Bucharest in the summer of 1991. As you

                        you remind us again of who the ambassador was and maybe talk a little bit

                <p>RICKERT: I arrived in July, and Alan Punch Green was the ambassador at the time,
                    a very interesting and fun person. He was a Republican from Oregon, one of the
                    reasons I decided to take the job with Packwood.</p>

                    the other senator...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Hatfield. But he knew Packwood, of course. He had been head of the
                    Republican party in Oregon and had been in charge of the Oregon for Bush
                    campaign when George Bush ran the first time.</p>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>RICKERT: In '88. Right. One never knows with Punch whether his stories were
                    entirely right or slightly apocryphal, but he claimed that he had been promised
                    a very nice embassy after the election and mentioned Stockholm as one of the
                    possibilities. Then Oregon was one of the states that didn't go for George Bush,
                    Sr. When he came to talk about embassies, the White House operatives mentioned
                    places in Africa that he hadn't heard of before, and Romania was the only place
                    in Europe. It was, of course, a dreadful place in 1988, but he knew where it was
                    and what continent it was on, so he took it and, of course, he ended up being
                    there for the revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he had been there approximately two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. He presented his credentials in December '89, so about two weeks
                    before Ceausescu bit the dust. Larry Napper who was my immediate predecessor had
                    arrived in the summer of '89 and had been charg� for several months, and
                    Ambassador Green came, and all of a sudden it “hit the fan” as they say. They
                    had a very difficult and challenging time which the ambassador and especially
                    Larry and the embassy came through with flying colors. He was a very honest sort
                    of person. He didn't pretend to know what he didn't know, and for a political
                    ambassadohe was the first political ambassador that I'd worked closely withe had
                    very great admiration for the career foreign service. I remember when I arrived
                    and we had our first chat. he said, “You have one duty: the same as Larry Napper
                    had.” And he said words to the effect that “When I leave this post, I want to
                    leave with my head held high knowing I've done nothing to harm the interests of
                    the United States and everything possible that I could to advance the interests
                    of the United States. Your job is to make it happen, and the rest doesn't
                    matter.” I thought well, there's a man that has his priorities right! He was, if
                    the truth be known, not a terribly effective ambassador, but he was a wonderful
                    supporter of the embassy staff. He did everything that he possibly could. He
                    took advice, he did the best that he could and gave credit to everyone possible
                    for the things that happened. We were only together for about six months because
                    I arrived in July and then he left in January. I developed a very good working
                    relationship with him and a great deal of affection for him as a human being.
                    He's passed away since, but it was a good experience. I remember there was a
                    delegation headed by Congressman Gibbons... What was his name...</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Yes. he was the Chairman of the Trade Sub-committee in the House Ways
                    and Means Committee. Sam Gibbons. He was, from what I could see, I met him as
                    desk officer and didn't know him well, but he seemed to me to be a fine person.
                    he was a D-Day vet, and he was traveling around in Eastern Europe with a
                    delegation from his sub-committee, a large delegation, and they all took a
                    rather dim view of Romania. Perhaps I should go back very briefly to mention
                    what the problem was at the time, and that was that Romania had its revolution
                    in December '89, and then their elections were in May of '90, and they were free
                    but not fair. Former Communist group gained control, and when opposition to that
                    group developed in the month of June and there were street demonstrations and so
                    forth, a large number of coal miners from the Zhu Valley appeared in town and
                    knocked heads and trashed opposition parties and so forth and so on. At that
                    point, the U. S. quite rightly put relations with Romania, which had been
                    developing fairly positively, on hold. Punch Green did not have much to do with
                    the president particularly who was seen as the person who had instigated this,
                    Yanney Yoyescu. It was, of course, noticed by the Romanians and it caused not
                    any open friction, but there was some tension in the air. The Hill was very much
                    aware of these problems, and they had no particular desire to come to Romania
                    under the circumstances. But one of their stops got cancelled, so we had a
                    telegram saying, “CODEL Gibbons is arriving tomorrow with 30 people including
                    spouses and hangers-on. We want to meet with this, this and this.” We were able
                    to do everything, and it was a successful visit. Gibbons was very nice to deal
                    with on this. Ambassador Green gave a good briefing for them in the living room
                    of his residence. Afterwards and after they had gone he said, “Jonathan, how did
                    I do?” I said, “Mr. Ambassador, it was a very, very good briefing.” He said,
                    “No, please tell me. I want you to be honest. How did I do?” I said, “Well, it
                    was good. You covered all the points.” He said, “Jonathan. I want you to tell me
                    how I did.” I said, “Well, it was a little bit too long.” “Too long!” The honest
                    answer isn't always the best one. He did go on a little bit too long in my view,
                    but ever after, he was very kind to me, and he never did anything nasty at all,
                    but occasionally when he'd give a speech he'd say, “Jon, was that too long?”
                    Thereafter. When we had him to dinner just before he left and I gave a toast, I
                    remember saying that after having given him advice to keep things short, I had
                    to follow my own advice and keep my own toast short which I did. A couple of
                    other little things about Punch Green. This is not meant in any way to disparage
                    my predecessor for whom I have the highest regard, but after I'd been there
                    about a month, I'd go into his office in the afternoons, and he wasn't terribly
                    occupied. Occasionally, we'd sit down and we'd just talk, and he'd tell stories
                    about Oregon and politics and other things. I did this about once a week. I
                    remember he said, “Jonathan, you know I have the highest possible regard for
                    Larry Napper. He is a prince among men and an outstanding diplomat, but in the
                    two years we were together, he never once came in for a chat.” Larry was all
                    business. I think Ambassador Green needed someone to come in for a chat once in
                    a while. Whether I sensed that or not, I did, and I think he appreciated it. We
                    had a number of issues while he was there but not much that was resolved in view
                    of the relatively short time we were together. The adoption issue which is still
                    current today as we speak was still very much in the forefront. The Romanians
                    had a corrupt system which involved money and babies essentially being bought.
                    Then under pressure from us and the Europeans, they put a halt to all adoptions.
                    Then a lot of people were caught who were part way through the process and were
                    not able to complete the proceedings. They were unhappy, and they'd spent money.
                    I was called by at least one U. S. senator at home about a case, Senator Dodd of
                    Connecticut who was completely proper. He didn't say anything that he shouldn't
                    have said, but getting a call at home from a U. S. senator is a message in
                    itself even if the words were entirely unexceptional. Mary Ryan called me about
                    cases. I spent time. One week I met three times with the foreign minister and
                    once with the president and once with the justice minister on adoptions. It was
                    the only issue that anyone seemed to care about in the United States at that
                    time which to my mind was disappointing and unfortunate because it was
                    important, but we did have bigger fish to fry. When Punch Green left... I never
                    called him Punch. I always called him Mr. Ambassador, and he said when he left,
                    “Now you can call me Punch.” I never tried before, but he was known as “Punch”
                    by everybody outside of the embassy. He met with Iliescu for a farewell call
                    which was polite but a little bit...I wouldn't say “frosty” but...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I went with him. A little bit stiff. He talked about his tour there and
                    what he'd experienced. He said one of his regrets was that he hadn't had a
                    chance to learn Romanian. He said he really had a choice between trying to
                    master Romanian and doing the best he could to build up U. S.-Romanian relations
                    and he hoped the president agreed that he spent his time wisely on the latter
                    and not the former. Iliescu politely agreed. Then he told a little joke, and he
                    said regarding languages. He said, “There's a little joke I want to tell you.”
                    He said, “What is somebody who speaks three languages? The answer is trilingual.
                    What is someone to speaks two languages? Bilingual. What is someone who speaks
                    one language? American!” He told that one himself in a very nice,
                    self-deprecating manner. One of the things I neglected to mention was in
                    September of '91 we had another visit from the coal miners. It was their fourth.
                    The last time they actually got to Bucharest. They tried another time and were
                    stopped before they got to town. It was, as the previous ones had been, very
                    carefully orchestrated. They knew exactly where they were going and exactly what
                    they were doing. They were led by a firebrand gentleman named Miron Cozma who
                    was a rabble rouser and a slime ball at the same time, in whose pay be was, and
                    all the rest. There's a lot of speculation and not much proof, but it was
                    fortunate in a way. This happened just after we'd had one of those embassy
                    Crisis Management Exercises, literally within a month after that we had the
                    events in Moscow in August where it looked like a lot worse was going to happen
                    than actually did, and then in September the coal miners in Bucharest where a
                    couple of people were killed. A lot of property was destroyed, and so forth.
                    They hit the main government building, the parliament, and a TV station, not by
                    chance. They knew where to go. There were Molotov cocktails and gunfire and a
                    lot of other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American embassy, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No. No. American embassy was not a target in any of these events
                    including the revolution. I would sathis is a selective judgmenI don't think
                    there is any nationality in Eastern Europe that is more pro-American than the
                    Romanians. The Poles are way up there obviously, but the Romanians had a great
                    admiration and respect for the United States even though they claim that through
                    the Yalta agreement we abandoned them to the Soviets; but that is another story.
                    They say, “We've been waiting 50 years for the Americans.” Shortly after this
                    had transpired, Cozma asked to meet with Ambassador Green. We arranged for him
                    to meet at the residence, so it wasn't a secret meeting, but at least it wasn't
                    a public meeting. I was there as interpreter because he didn't want an FSN doing
                    the interpreting for that occasion, and a political officer and a few others
                    were there. Cozma had one of hiI was going to say “henchmen”, but maybe
                    “associates” would be more neutrawith him. He had a terrible cold as did the
                    other fellow, and Ambassador Green was a pill freak. Not controlled substances
                    but any over-the-counter medicine that could be had, he had. During this meeting
                    he ran upstairs and he came down with Tylenol Plus or something which he gave to
                    the coal miner. It was surreal interview. It was very difficult to figure out
                    what they wanted or why they wanted it. I did my best to interpret, but I did
                    not understand what he was saying. It was a real mix of fantasy and all sorts of
                    strange things. I don't think much came out of it, but it showed that the
                    American ambassador was ready to listen to all sides.</p>
                <p>When Ambassador Green left, he was...I might add that he was a millionaire, and
                    he wasn't a person who was very interested in material things, and we tried
                    to... Interestingly, he was interested in money as a barometer of how he was
                    doing, but he wasn't interested in money particularly for buying things. He
                    didn't collect antiques. He didn't collect art. He wasn't out looking to find
                    ways to show off the money, but the embassy wanted to give him a present when he
                    left. In the end, there was a painter who sold a number of paintings to the
                    people at the embassy, and he did very nice things at a very reasonable price.
                    Alan Duckall who was head of the American library there who knew him well,
                    arranged to have him do a painting of the chancery and with the Cadillac which
                    Ambassador Green was very proud of with a flag on it. It had taken a bullet
                    sometime in the revolution, and he never, he refused to ever have the bullet
                    hole repaired. So the painting had the Chancery and the Cadillac in the driveway
                    there, and the flag on the front fender, and the bullet hole. He was very
                    pleased with his farewell gift which was well under whatever limit there was for
                    gifts at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Green left, and there was a hiatus for three or four months, and then John Davis
                    came. John, of course, was a career diplomat and spent many years in Poland,
                    three tours in all, thirteen years, and most recently had been an ambassador
                    there. It was his last post, and he and his wife Helen were delightful people to
                    work with and for, and it was very much a professional high point of my career
                    to spend that time with him. He knew Eastern Europe, and he knew transition from
                    Communism having been through it in Poland although there were significant
                    differences. He made Romanians feel that he was on their side even when he was
                    telling them things that they didn't want to hear necessarily. He just did a
                    terrific job. He was an ideal choice at that time. Unfortunately, his tour was
                    cut short by illness, so he wasn't there as long as I would have liked, but he
                    did an excellent job. Helen was a very professional, traditional foreign service
                    spouse of the best sort. Not only did we get on very well professionally, but
                    both I and my wife really enjoyed their company. We spent a lot of time with
                    them “off duty,” so to speak. In the end they got two dogs from a litter that
                    was from the dog owned by the Swedish ambassador, and we got the last of the
                    littler. So there are three of those dogs now in the United States. Cocker
                    Spaniels.</p>
                <p>John arrived just after the first local elections took place in Romania in the
                    spring of '92. Then there was a new prime minister. The coal miners resulted in
                    the ousting of Prime Minister Petre Roman and Theodor Stolojan. Stolojan was a
                    caretaker prime minister to help prepare the country for national elections
                    which he did. It took longer than it should have, but he was a former finance
                    minister and subsequently worked at the World Bank for several years so he was a
                    very well qualified person. John had excellent relations with all of top
                    leadership including with Iliescu. He was able to speak to them in a way that
                    wasn't talking down but which was straightforward and giving them in a sense
                    fatherly advice on how they might help their cause which was very interesting to
                    see.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>I might mention a couple of things about Romania as it was when I got there. It
                    was still very much in the summer of '91 not that far away from the revolution.
                    There were lots of signs around Bucharest. There wasn't heavy artillery or
                    anything, but there were burned buildings and bullet holes. The DCM's residence
                    had a number of bullet holes in it. An indoor balcony in the living room had a
                    bullet dent in it. One of the things I did there was to get a little brass
                    plaque to put there because two DCM's come and go and nobody knows anything, and
                    it wasn't painted over, it was something that had happened. We found that the
                    antennae for the television in our house in the residence there had been shot by
                    sharpshooters and had been severed in two places by bullets. That wasn't
                    accidental when the house was not near other buildings... It was near other
                    buildings but not that would have been used by snipers, so somebody had
                    presumably assumed that the antennae was being used for nefarious purposes and
                    had cut it down with rifle fire during oppressive shooting. There were a number
                    of buildings that Ceausescu had started by weren't finished. These hulks of
                    semi-finished buildings all over town including the famous Palace of the People,
                    Casa Republicii or “House of the People” literally which was about 80% done and
                    is reputed to be the largest office building in the world, larger than the
                    Pentagon. It was there in all of its garish glory. People didn't know what to do
                    with it. There was talk about tearing it down, but it was so huge, and so much
                    had gone into it that that was not really feasible. So they finished it up, and
                    now it's being used for parliament and a number of other purposes.</p>
                <p>It was a country where suspicion was still widespread. Nobody knew who was behind
                    the miners. The opposition was paranoid. They thought that everything the
                    government was doing was designed to marginalize them and to drive them out of
                    public life. A lot of the opposition leaders had left Romania at one time or
                    another and had come back. The head of the Peasant Party, one of the two main
                    “historical parties” as they call them, was a man named Copulescu who spent 18
                    years in Communist prisons. There was a great deal of bitterness on the part of
                    people who had suffered and didn't see things getting better quickly. Issues of
                    property restitution were still unresolved. People who had been informers were
                    still in or were active in state security in high places, and there was a lot of
                    disappointment that things weren't moving faster. One of the leaders of
                    post-revolutionary government, a man named Silviu Brucan, who had been a big
                    Communist who had been ambassador to the UN and to Washington. He said in the
                    spring of '90 that it would take ten years for Romania to become a normal
                    country. He was roundly criticized by right, left, and center as being almost
                    anti-Romanian to say it would take that long. Of course, he was being overly
                    optimistic.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>I recall having some friends to lunch one day, all former or present FSN's who we
                    knew from our previous tour, and they were all supporters of the opposition. And
                    they came to lunch on Saturday, and they complained and complained and
                    complained, “Nothing has changed. The Commies are still running it. Its the
                    same.” Finally, I'd heard enough, and I said to them politely, “Wait a minute.
                    You came in here through the front door without any fear. You're sitting at the
                    table of the American DCM. You're speaking openly about your dissatisfaction
                    with all of the things and people you don't like in this country. You have no
                    fear that anything is going to happen to you because you've done this. And you
                    say nothing's changed?” They said, “Yes, of course you're right, but we expected
                    so much more.” I think that was really it. I used to liken Romania at that time
                    to a man who had been suffering from a slow growing tumor year after year after
                    year, and as it grew he became weaker and weaker. But suddenly he woke up one
                    morning, and the tumor was gone. He said, “Ah, I'm no longer it. I can go back
                    to the way I was before I developed this tumor.” But of course, the tumor had
                    done its damage on his body, and this man in my little example was unwilling to
                    accept the fact that he had to rebuild his strength to get back to where he was.
                    I use this often with Romanians because many very intelligent and otherwise
                    intelligent people believe the problem was communism and once you got rid of
                    Ceausescu and communism, Romania could become a normal Western European country
                    in two to five years. They failed to take into account the damage that had been
                    done by 40 years of communism. There was a lot of frustration and
                    unhappiness.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked some about U. S.-Romanian relations and some
                        of the issues: adoption and so on. You might want to talk some more about
                        that, or I'm also interested to what extent you and the ambassador and the
                        embassy were involved in the neighborhood, the region, the issues that
                        Romania had with some of its neighbors. I don't know whether NATO entry and
                        entry into the European community was under discussion then. That came
                        later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Those are good questions. Actually, during the time that I was there,
                    the partnership for PFPartnership for Peacwas launched, and Romania was the
                    first country in the region to sign on because they rightly calculated that that
                    was the gate through which they would have to pass to have a chance for NATO
                    membership. Indeed, Madeleine Albright came out and was the one who gave the
                    pitch on Partnership for Peace.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Yes. The biggest issue in the region overtly during the first part of my
                    time there was sanctions against Serbia. The upheaval was going on in the former
                    Yugoslavia, and sanctions had been imposed on Serbia. Romania was trying, on the
                    one hand, to observe the sanctions and get in our good graces for that and on
                    the other hand to make as much money out of the situation as possible at least
                    on the personal level if not on the government level. With a border with Serbia
                    and the Danube River there was plenty of opportunity at money making. indeed,
                    there was an arrangement we had with many of the countries in the region where
                    we sent customs people for what we called SAMSanctions Assistance Missionand
                    there was one in Bucharest. There was one in Bulgaria. There was one in Hungary.
                    Those were the ones I knew most closely. There were others as well. These
                    missions had customs officers who worked with the local customs to try and
                    tighten up the procedures and prevent illegal smuggling.</p>
                <p>The U. S. was providing a long-term TDY customs officers to these SAMS or
                    Sanctions Assistance Missions to help the local customs services in Hungary,
                    Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries, cut down on smuggling. The idea, of
                    course, was to prevent gasoline and other needed goods from going into Serbia.
                    Incidentally, my wife worked as a PIT (part-time, intermittent, temporary) on
                    the SAM team in Bucharest which put her well out of the chain of command and
                    enabled her, with her fluent Romanian, to provide a very useful service: fluent
                    Romanian and knowledge of the country and how things worked and all the rest.
                    The U. S. customs folks were very professional customs officers, but they were
                    babes in woods when it came to knowing how things work in Romania and did have
                    the wool pulled over their eyes on occasion. Gerd was helpful in avoiding some
                    mistakes but not all of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Romania lost a lot of money due to the closing down of the Danube as an artery of
                    transport. They do a lot of transport both from Romania and as a transit. I
                    remember the deputy foreign minister who later became foreign minister talking
                    to me about this and saying they lost so many billions of dollars, and was there
                    anything that the United States could do to compensate them for these losses. I
                    remember telling him that I thought it was very doubtful that we could
                    compensate him, but that he might want to think creatively, and he asked what I
                    meant. I said, “Well, you come to us with these complaints. The Hungarians come
                    to us with these complaints. The Bulgarians come to us with these complaints.
                    I'm not saying that you would get any money out of it, but you might get
                    people's attention if the three of you came together with the same plea.” He was
                    really taken with this idea because its very un-Romanian to do anything in
                    concert with others of this nature. You look after yourself and let others look
                    after themselves. It was a lesson that they subsequently had learned, and I'd
                    like to think I planted one of the early seeds. In any case, it was a new idea,
                    a very competent and career diplomat. They never have gotten anything back as
                    far as I know, but their losses have been recognized in many ways. During the
                    Kosovo conflict, Romania and Bulgaria and Hungary all got UNICEF to help
                    compensate them in that way. It wasn't dollar for dollar, but it was of some
                    help, so I don't think it was completely a lost cause. Hungary was the other
                    issue. Well, there were three issues. The Yugoslav situation. Hungary where
                    traditionally there has been...I wouldn't say hatred, but Hungary was the
                    occupying power in Transylvania and the Banat until 1918 or so. Then, after
                    World War I, Romania got those territories back by referendum. They were
                    majority Romanian, but there were substantial ethnic Hungarian minorities. If
                    the truth be known, a lot of Hungarians were educated and cultured people, and a
                    lot of the Romanians were peasants, so its been difficult politically and
                    psychologically for the Hungarians to accept this loss. The Romanians until
                    recently had always been fearful of some kind of irredentism or some kind of
                    deal to take that territory back. They lost Northern Transylvania in 1940 to the
                    Hungarians through a deal that was made between the Germans and the Russians if
                    I recall correctly, and they lost Bessarabia in Northern Bukovina in the same
                    manner. They're slightly paranoid but not crazy because it has happened.
                    Relations with Hungary were correct, and there were no overt frictions. But
                    there is always a strain because of the fear that somehow Hungary, being more
                    advanced, would get into the West first and would block the Romanians or would
                    demand concessions as a price for letting them into NATO or EU or other
                    organizations.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Fortunately, none of the dire consequences that were foreseen have occurred, but
                    it was something that preoccupied politicians, particularly those Romanians who
                    were born in Transylvania. Its understandable, but its regrettable. The
                    Hungarians in Romania by and large have played a positive and constructive
                    political role, but they do have an agenda which relates to their own ethnic
                    group when it comes to education and bilingual road signs and other cultural and
                    educational and self-government types of issues. The Romanians, unfortunately,
                    until recently have looked at, in effect, any concession to the Hungarians,
                    their own ethnic Hungarians, as being a loss for themselves. One of the things
                    that I tried to do in talking with Romanians during my time there was to say
                    that if you have a minority within your borders that is satisfied with the way
                    its being treated, it will be less troublesome than if it has what it perceives
                    to be a lot of unaddressed issues. Many of the things that the ethnic Hungarians
                    wanted, in fact, to any objective person, did not involve denigration of
                    Romanian power, influence, or authority. I counseled them to look at the things
                    they could do that would cost them the least but make the Hungarians less
                    dissatisfied. They didn't do it during my time, but the present coalition, de
                    facto coalition between the Hungarian Party and the Social Democratic Party, is
                    based on that approach where the Social Democratic Party needs them to have a
                    parliamentary majority. The Hungarians are willing to do that as long as they
                    get some of their issues addressed. Interestingly, the Social Democrats who were
                    empowered when I was there under a different name and were rather strongly
                    resistant of doing anything for the Hungarians now have come around and are
                    taking a much more constructive approach, so all sides are learning. And then
                    the third, of course. I mentioned Serbia, Hungary, and then the third was
                    Moldova. Although that's the most emotional issue for at least some Romanians
                    because it was part of Romania until 1940, and then it was taken away by
                    force.</p>
                <p>The second president of Romania, Emil Constantinescu, was born in Moldova. Many
                    prominent Romanian intellectuals and others are from that area or have roots
                    there. They're torn because they recognize that Moldova is an independent
                    country. They were the first country to recognize its independence. They believe
                    that Moldova should have free choice and so forth. Emotionally they also believe
                    that the only sensible thing for Moldova to do is to come back to the
                    motherland, and it shows no sign of doing so which is cause of frustration. The
                    large Russian minority there is part of the problem. Its not a domestic
                    political issue in a direct way any more than the return of the royal family as
                    king is a domestic political issue. But it is one of those things that is there
                    in society. It comes up whenever something bad happens in Moldova. The press is
                    full of it because of the close association, and on the part of some at least,
                    the unrealistic dream that someday the Moldovans will wake up and see that they
                    really belong as part of Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't mentioned either Ukraine or Bulgaria. Those
                        are not particularly concerns.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No. There was one major concern with Ukraine. It is territorial because
                    after World War II a rocky, uninhabited piece of island in the Black Sea, under
                    Soviet pressure became part of the Soviet Union and, therefore, part of Ukraine.
                    The island itself has no value whatsoever, but it is the point against which the
                    maritime boundary is delineated. There is some oil and gas in the Black Sea.
                    Quantities are not known, but where the line is drawn could have a very
                    significant influence on how much oil and gas either Ukraine or Romania is able
                    to extract. That's been the main point. There have been some concerns on the
                    Romanian side about ethnic Romanians who were living in Ukraine, mostly in what
                    used to be known as Bukovina and in, to a lesser extent, in parts of Moldova.
                    The ethnic Romanian minority in Ukraine was a sub-concern, not a main concern.
                    Relations during my time there were correct, but there weren't major problems
                    and, indeed, the Snakes Island issue hadn't really come to a fore. That happened
                    later, but it was in the back of Romanians minds quite clearly. The case of
                    Bulgaria having lived in Bulgaria and Romania, I'm always amazed at how little
                    either knows about the other or cares about the other. They share so much in
                    common, yet they don't hate each other or there are no real issues. Some
                    territory is switched back and forth in Dibroja, but that's not an active issue.
                    The populations moved at the time this happened, so there are very few
                    Bulgarians in Romania and very few Romanians in Bulgaria. Neither one really
                    thinks all that highly of the other, and they don't have issues, but they spend
                    their energy dealing with others. I remember listening to the foreign minister
                    at one time being asked who Romania's best neighbor was. He thought for a while,
                    and I've heard other Romanians say this: He said, “I think its the Black Sea.”
                    They don't really care for any of their neighbors particularly, and I'm sure
                    that feeling is reciprocated although in the last few years through NATO and
                    other European organizations, they've worked at developing better relations with
                    their neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of the Black Sea, is that something that ever
                        engaged the embassy in terms of ship visits or otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. I've forgotten the name of the exercise, but there was an exercise
                    that we carried out in the Black Sea to show that we regarded it as
                    international water. Once or twice a year a destroyer would go in and sail
                    around the Black Sea and show up at Constanza. It wasn't an issue with
                    Romanians. They were very happy to have us there as I'm sure the Bulgarians
                    were, but it was really aimed at the Soviet Union when there still was one and
                    continued afterwards. We had a number of ship visits and used to go down to
                    Constanza the port which was at least a couple of hours drive from Bucharest. It
                    was always a pleasure in that the Navy officers and their commanders were I
                    always felt in Romania excellent diplomats in showing the flag literally and
                    figuratively at a time when our political relations were not all that great with
                    Romania. Military relations were developing very well, and we had visits from
                    Admiral Owens who was the head of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, and his
                    successor Admiral Lopez very well received, very well spoken in Bucharest. They
                    didn't mix in the politics, but they gave Romanians a feel for what they might
                    expect if they got their political act together which is exactly what we wanted
                    them to do. General Joulwan came as the supreme NATO commander which was a
                    personal pleasure for me because he comes from the same relatively small town in
                    Pennsylvania where my father was born and raised and where I used to go as a
                    child: Pottsville, Pennsylvania, the home of Yuengling Beer, the oldest brewery
                    in the United States dating from 1829. General Joulwan told me he had cases of
                    Yuengling because people whenever they came from the States brought him a case
                    knowing that's where he was from! Very nice man, also an excellent diplomat in
                    the sense of helping to give the Romanians a taste of what they could expect,
                    again, if they got their act together which, I think, was exactly what they
                    needed.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: The sense I had was that Romanians wanted to continue to play that role,
                    but times had passed, and they really didn't any longer have the clout that they
                    had had. I'm no Middle East expert, but at that time, of course, earlier, we had
                    no direct dealings with Arafat. Romanians did. We could communicate with Arafat
                    through Romania but by the '90s, we were dealing with Arafat. There were other
                    cases like that where the intermediary role was no longer as useful or as
                    necessary. But the Romanians maintained their interest until the Russians
                    started coming to Israel in large numbers. Jews of Romanian origin were the
                    largest group of European Jews in Israel, and they're still very substantial.
                    There were a lot of Israeli businessmen. Although the number of Jews remaining
                    in Romania was estimated at around 10,000, still the community was very active.
                    The head of the community was Rabbi Moses Rosen who had been the chief rabbi for
                    decades and was a very prominent figure not, of course, far beyond his own
                    community. The Joy Distribution Committee was very active in providing food and
                    other material for the Jewish community. Jewish restitution was starting to
                    become an issue. Stu Eisenstadt, while he was still ambassador to...head of
                    USAC...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...became the European union later...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right. He had from President Clinton kind of a special responsibility to
                    deal with issues of restitution, and I'm happy to say that the third ambassador
                    I served under, Alfred Moses, who is very definitely Jewish, emphasized very
                    strongly to Stu Eisenstadt when he came to Bucharest, “You are responsible for
                    restitution and not just Jewish restitution,” because in Romania if it were seen
                    that the United States were taking an exclusive interest in the Jewish aspect,
                    it could have had an unfortunate backlash. Eisenstadt did take that seriously,
                    and there was a lot of other restitutions both sectarian and just ordinary
                    citizens that needed to be attended to, and Eisenstadt did take it on. This is
                    later, toward the end of my time in Romania. There were so many things that
                    happened there, I must say. I might just talk a little bit about the personal
                    side because there were people we had known in the '70s, and you go back to a
                    place, you've known them under one set of circumstances, and then you
                    reestablish contact with them. They were delighted to see us because we
                    represented something, some continuity between the old and the new, and we
                    maintained friendships from a distance on occasion through the difficult
                    periods. These were mostly cultural people that a number of artists and two in
                    particular with whom we had become extremely friendly in the '70s and then
                    resumed friendships in the '90s. One of them, I remember he came to the DCM
                    residence, and he was just delighted to have been able to come as a free person.
                    He sat down on the sofa, and he seemed to grow several inches. Both of these
                    artists unfortunately have passed away since then, but I'm glad he lived to see
                    this. We started talking about things, and it got in a little bit sensitive
                    areslightland he looked around and said, “Are there microphones here?” I said,
                    “Probably so. We don't look for them, but I don't know who's listening
                    nowadays.” He kind of looked around and in effect said, “Oh, what the hell!” and
                    then went on with what he was going to say. I thought, “That's a good sign!”</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ...when we came back. He apologized for having reported on us to the
                    securitatay which we said, “We knew what you had to do.” That was the price for
                    being able to have any contact with us. He felt very badly about it because I
                    guess he felt he'd betrayed us as friends. We weren't talking politics with him.
                    We weren't doing anything that was in any way secretive or secret, and we knew
                    that this had to happen. His name was Georgay Spiridon. He was a moderately, a
                    decent artist, not a top artist but a very delightful human being. I still go
                    back to Romania about once a year and always see his widow and one daughter
                    who's living there. It was a delight to resume that contact. The other artist
                    that we saw less of this time because of this age and infirmity was a man named
                    Cornell Yubabba who was probably Romania's leading painter at that time. A very
                    unusual and fascinating man who was in his 90's and had a stroke but was still
                    painting. He lived about a block from our house, and we used to go over. Gerd
                    would go over and see his wife from time to time. Occasionally I would go over.
                    They were wonderful friends, and they appreciated the fact that we stuck by them
                    during the grim period and helped them in little ways to the extent that we
                    could. Again, whenever I'm in Bucharest, I always go and see Costenz Yubabba.
                    She's always very pleased to see somebody who was a friend during the Bad Old
                    Days. And then we made a number of new friends, too. Interesting people. Again,
                    some of them we could deal with political and government people freely without
                    any trouble at all, but it seemed that the cultural people were the ones that we
                    developed the closest contacts with. We were very grateful for that insight into
                    the life of the country that we got through those people rather than just what
                    we could get through the politicians and the government servants.</p>

                        not there for too long and that he had to leave for health reasons. When was

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He left in August '9 I was charg� two years in all of the four years
                    that I was there. He'd been away for virtually the whole year for medical
                    treatment. Then Al Moses, Alfred Moses, came in December of '94. He came having
                    just learned that his wife had ovarian cancer, so we were together from December
                    until July '95. He had an arrangement with EUR whereby he spent one week a month
                    in Romania and three weeks in Washington looking after his wife. He worked very
                    hard in the Department on the Hill and elsewhere, but he was not in Bucharest.
                    He was ambassador in name, but he wasn't in country a whole lot.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been tricky for you to have him there for a
                        week, gone for three weeks, back a week. I can see that some things had to
                        be done and you did them, but other things you probably thought, “Well, I'd
                        better wait.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Well, that's true, but he was always reachable in Washington, and he was
                    in touch with the desk all of the time. He ended up writing instructions and
                    things from that end. He was quite close to Holbrooke, and Holbrooke was
                    assistant secretary at the latter part there, so that made it work out easily. I
                    found it more difficult in terms of internal things. If it were your embassy, I
                    think that anyone who's in charge as ambassador or long-term charg� is going to
                    want to rearrange things in certain ways. I didn't feel it was an option because
                    I was very much a caretaker, and it isn't healthy in an organization to have
                    changes and have the new person come in or the person who is really in charge
                    come in and take over and say, “No, I want to do it differently again.” You put
                    staff and other people through too many changes, and it's harmful. I kind of
                    left things like they were organizationally and structurally and tried to make
                    it work as well as possible and left it to the ambassador to decide whether or
                    not he wanted to do things differently. Moses did, but nothing radical has
                    happened under his successor, but that's another story.</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Moses was very involved with the Cyprus problem
                        after Romania.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. He was appointed as sort of an unpaid envoy for Cyprus
                    after he finished his tour in Bucharest, so that's a separate matter. There are
                    so many ways in which one would like to express the atmosphere that existed in
                    Romania in the early '90s. Romania is just very different from any of the other
                    countries. It's the Balkan mentality and the extent of the way the whole system
                    was corrupted by the leadership and the way Communism was practiced. As you
                    know, I'm sure, the Communist party in 1945 numbered under 2,000 people, and yet
                    it because the ruling party. This didn't happen by popular demand. It happened
                    through the presence of the Red Army. You had in a sense an illegitimate party
                    running the country. Of the less than 2,000 people, less than half were ethnic
                    Romanians. There were Jews, there were Ukrainians, there were Hungarians, there
                    were others. It was very much a non-Romanian phenomenon from an ethnic point of
                    view. Communism in Romania was highly influenced by you might say “illegitimate”
                    origins. I think a lot of the quirks and foibles of the experience of Romania in
                    the '90s resulted from this very complex history and a party that had to always
                    present itself as the voice of the Romanian people, yet everyone knowing that
                    until it was imposed by the Russian ArmSoviet Armthat it wasn't a voice of
                    anything or anyone. Of course, by the time I was there the first time, it was a
                    party of close to three million people. It was a mass party, and people were
                    encouraged to join in order to Romanianize it from the Romania point of view.
                    They were led to believe there would be personal advantages like the admission
                    to schools and universities and all sorts of other things. So it was not a very
                    highly philosophical or idealistic appeal to get people in, but most everyone it
                    seemed to me was a party member at some time or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, that was the case when you were there in the '90s that
                        they were the former...the party members were still very active in politics
                        and otherwise? ...about the former security, the securitatay.</hi>

                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>RICKERT: The former party members... You couldn't hold a responsible position in
                    Romania with rare exceptions without being a party member. That's the way it
                    was. It was your union card in a union shop. So a lot of good and decent people
                    were party members. As you know, there was very little dissidence. There was no
                    organized dissidence in Romania. Nothing like soladar nascurim chartered 77 or
                    whatever it was in Czech Republic. There was no goulash Communism as there was
                    in Hungary. It was, not too be too cruel, a very large group of opportunists who
                    were making the best of a difficult situation. The securitate people were still
                    very much in evidence as elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Various security forces
                    knew where the money was, and they got hold of it, and they quickly became the
                    business people as well as important in government and other areas of life. They
                    are still in influence in Romania even today although less so than they were in
                    the early '90s. One of the things that happened during Ambassador Davis's time
                    and afterward, things started to warm up a bit, and we started to get visits
                    which we hadn't had while neighboring Bulgaria and, of course, Hungary, were
                    awash with visits. I mentioned the military folks that had come, but Ambassador
                    Albright came during the latter part. Former President Bush came with his wife.
                    Former Secretary Baker came. They were invited to give paid speeches but, of
                    course, they met with all the top people in the process. A number of senators
                    and congressmen came. Shelby came just after he switched parties. Dan Coats and
                    Frank Wolf came when Coats was still in the senate. That was in connection with
                    the prayer breakfast. Interestingly, they were inviting the president and other
                    top prime ministers and others to come to the prayer breakfast which they
                    declined to do, and now Romanians are among the eager attendees at the annual
                    prayer breakfast. Tom Lantos came. Bart Gordon of Georgia came. Eagleburger
                    came. He came earlier on when he was still deputy secretary. Frank Wisner came.
                    That was an interesting one. He was under secretary of defense at the time, but
                    his father had been in the OSS in Romania, and Frank was very eager to come
                    because he heard stories. One of the things that he said when he was there there
                    was a picture of his father at Sinaia which is where the summer royal palace was
                    and a photograph taken at the Pele? Palace in Sinaia, and they took a picture of
                    Frank at the same spot which I think was a very satisfying thing for him. The
                    Brzezinski s came as friends of the Davises. Many of the former ambassadors to
                    Romania came back. All but one of the living ambassadors since '62 came back
                    during my time there, and some of them came several times. I don't think there's
                    another country in Europe where that would apply.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Right! Yeah! I've often said that Romania is a benign but incurable
                    virus: Once infected, one never really gets over it. The fact that all those
                    folks came back: Roger Kirk, Rudy Aggrey, Harry Barnes came several times, Bill
                    Crawford who was ambassador from '62 to '65 came back. Actually I was
                    instrumental in getting him back. His son was the Commerce Department
                    representative there. I've known Bill a number of years. He's since passed away,
                    but he and his first wife founded the American school in Bucharest in the
                    1960's. I was chairman of the school board as DCM, so I was in touch with Bill
                    and said, “It would be great if you could come while we're here, and your son's
                    here.” He had various excuses why he couldn't come. I'm sure he would have, but
                    I hoped he'd come while my wife and I were still there. His second wife is
                    Swedish, and that's actually how I met him was through her. I worked out a deal
                    with the director of the American school. I think the school was having its 30th
                    anniversary or something like that, and so I asked the director, and he agreed
                    enthusiastically to invite Ambassador Crawford to come and give the commencement
                    address. Then he did come because he felt that, I guess, he couldn't say no to
                    that. He saw a number of older folks he had known, and I think he was very glad
                    that he did it, but he needed a little extra push to get him to do it.</p>

                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yeah. Punch Green after he left came back on a cruise with a group of
                    well-heeled Stanford University grads to the Black Sea and then they had a day
                    in Constanza. He asked me well in advance. he said, “Jonathan, can you see what
                    you can do to get a meeting with the president for this group?” So I talked to
                    his press secretary whom I knew very well and explained the situation, and he
                    said he would see what he could do. Katalaya was his name. He was a career
                    diplomat. He set up a meeting when this group of older and well-heeled and
                    worldly Stanford grads came. It was at the Presidential Palace which is a very
                    impressive building, an old palace which had been added on to by Ceausescu with
                    actually good taste in this case in the same spirit as the original building.
                    Iliescu met with the group in a nice room, and they had chairs, and he stood in
                    front and he made some remarks, and they asked questions. In the end he spent
                    over two hours with them and gave them a tour of the palace himself. They were
                    floored! I think Punch Green was extremely gratified. I hadn't done anything
                    except pass on the request, but they rightly figured this would be a good
                    investment in time after they did it, and that's what happened. One of the
                    things we had during my first tour there was an embassy villa up in the
                    mountains in Soniya, the town where the royal palace was located. By the time we
                    got back, the embassy still had a villa, but it had been moved. Ceausescu kicked
                    them out of Soniya because they were too close to where his villa was or one of
                    his palaces. I think he was concerned about what might be going on in the
                    American embassy and the American embassy villa. The new villa was not far from
                    the railroad tracks, and we went there once and the trains went by regularly,
                    and we really didn't like it, and some other people agreed. So a committee was
                    formed of which my wife was a member to look for a new villa, and lo and behold!
                    they found the old villa which had been nicely fixed up since we were there. So
                    we moved back there and had great pleasure of using it from time to time until
                    the inspectors found this was a frivolous use of U. S. government money for all
                    of the villas, the one in Bulgaria and elsewhere. We were forced to close down,
                    but it was nice while it lasted.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Another thing. Dealing with the Romanian government. One of the things
                    that was wonderful the second time around was that how open they were. Both as
                    charg� and DCM, I could see anyone in the Romanian government virtually at any
                    time just by picking up the phone. It was not an entre that I abused, but it was
                    something that I could do. I did see the foreign minister very regularly. I
                    probably met with the president 30, 35 times in four years, alone occasionally,
                    with the ambassador more times, sometimes with visitors from Washington. We had
                    really an open door there which was great. Shortly after Ambassador Davis
                    arrived, we had a very sensitive issue regarding our FSN's and the securitate.
                    All of them, of course, had to report during the Communist period to the
                    securitate, but afterwards many of them reported as little as they could get
                    away with and still kept their jobs. But afterwards, people kept calling our
                    people, and we documented this very carefully: who, what, when, where. In one of
                    his early meetings with Iliescu, John Davis raised this and said, “If you really
                    want good relations with the United States, one of the things you will do is
                    call off your securitate people who are harassing our FSN's from the embassy.
                    Iliescu seemed genuinely surprised. I don't know if he was or not, but he said,
                    “We'll get to the bottom of this. I know nothing about this.” He assigned his
                    top aide for security matters, a man named Talfesch to work with me on this
                    issue. I met several times about this, and I presented him with a paper getting
                    all the information that we had without naming the names of the embassy FSN's,
                    but if they did their homework they could figure out who they were. In the end
                    he responded on the whole list, roughly 30 incidents and people. Some of them he
                    said he tracked down, and the former handlers had been in touch with him, and
                    they had been warned off. In some cases he came up with slightly different
                    information from what we had, and in some cases he claimed that they couldn't
                    identify who the person was or what have you. The response was less than
                    perfect, but to my mind it showed a reasonably good faith effort to deal with
                    the issue which, again, was a change from the earlier time. The incidents didn't
                    disappear, but there was a marked diminution of interference with our FSNs.
                    About the same time a counter-intelligence team arrived from Frankfurt and
                    interviewed our FSN's. They did this throughout Eastern Europe to try and find
                    out who had been doing what to whom to the extent that they could.
                    Interestingly, when they left at the debrief, they said that the remaining FSN's
                    were probably the most forthcoming of any. I'll never forget that one of them
                    allegedly said to the counter intelligence team something along these lines,
                    “You have to remember that everyone who was working in the embassy in 1989 fell
                    into one of three categories.” The first category was those who reported as
                    little as possible to the securitate just to keep their jobs. Second category,
                    much smaller, who enthusiastically volunteered to report to the securitate and
                    dug up and made up whatever they could which would ingratiate them with their
                    handlers. Then a small number of actual securitate officers was the third
                    category. Everybody who says that he or she isn't in one of these categories is
                    lying, this one person told the team.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I guess that leads to another thing that is really beyond the immediate scope of
                    this, but our station chief who was announced and was not clandestine was a man
                    named Harold J. Nicholson. We worked together for about a year. He was a liaison
                    between the internal service and external service. After he left he went to
                    Malaysia and was arrested as a Russian spy. He is now doing time someplace in
                    federal prison. He apparently took up his espionage activities after leaving
                    Romania, but I'm still amazed that somebody who was engaged in that kind of
                    activity so soon after a tour in Romania that no one at the embassy in Bucharest
                    except perhaps people from his agency were ever questioned by anybody about his
                    activities, his lifestyle, or anything else. I know for a fact neither the
                    ambassador, DCM or the RSO were questioned by DS, by CIA, by FBI, or by anyone
                    else. With the concerns about Aldrich Ames and about others, it struck me as
                    being irresponsible, and I have actually raised this matter with friends and
                    colleagues at the agency, and they tut-tutted and said, “That doesn't sound very
                    good.” And that's been the end of it. To my mind it was very, very sloppy
                    because Mr. Nicholson had a number of characteristics. His personal situation
                    was such that...not that one would have expected espionage, but there were very
                    serious family problems. It was obvious to people at the embassy, and there were
                    a lot of things going on that were well known that were not according to the
                    rules that existed at the time. That was disappointing, I must say. During the
                    time I was therthe whole time that I was therRomania was a critical threat for
                    both human and technical intelligence. That meant a strong non-frat policy. We
                    had to report contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Continuing the second time you were there. The '90s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Yeah. I'm talking about the '90s. In other words, according to the
                    scales that were used, there were four categories: the human, the technical
                    intelligence, terrorism, and crime. The categories were critical, high, medium,
                    and low. If you gave each one of these a number, say low is one, medium is two,
                    high is three, critical is four, and then did a cumulative, which I did,
                    actually, for Romania. Romania and Havana tied as the two worst posts in the
                    world which for somebody living and working in Romania was utterly preposterous,
                    but that's the way it was. The only good that I could see that came out of this
                    was we used this as a means to keep our project differential up because whenever
                    we asked why Romania was given such a high grade, high level on human and
                    technical intelligence, one could only conclude that we didn't have sufficiently
                    high clearance to be told or else there was nothing there. I remember writing up
                    one of those questionnaires and saying that this puts people under great stress
                    to know that we're in the highest category, yet we can't be told why. We kept
                    our high, maybe 20% differential. To show how times change, it dropped down to
                    15, and now its back up to 20. I saw the cable recently explaining why it is 20%
                    now, and it cited hardships such as “uncertain internet connections.” We didn't
                    have telephone connection when I was there. It was 15% under Ceausescu during my
                    first tour there. It is 20% now when it is a completely different situation. The
                    standards obviously changed. Medical was another aspect. Medical care was not up
                    to Western standards, but there are a number of Western doctors. When we were
                    there the first time my wife had some serious medical problems and was told to
                    see Romanian doctors in Romanian hospitals which she did. It didn't help a whole
                    lot, but that's how it was done. So things change. I'm glad for folks there now
                    that they have the 20% differential, but I'm not entirely sure they earned
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you wanted...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Let's see. One of the things we did with our Romanian friends was have a
                    Christmas party each year. Interestingly, the first two years we had parties for
                    the embassy community, and they didn't seem to show a whole lot of enthusiasm
                    for this, so we decided to invite Romanians which we did. One of the most moving
                    things that came out of this... We had a big group of Romanians, and the DCM
                    residence is a wonderful house there, and the ceiling is about 24, 25 feet tall
                    in the living room, and we got a Christmas tree each year that went up to the
                    ceiling. This had been a tradition for some years. At the end of the living room
                    were large windows, very large windows almost up to the ceilings, that look out
                    and a number of Romanians told us that during the dark years that they gained
                    hope by seeing that Christmas tree through the window and to be invited in to be
                    right next to it was a great privilege and pleasure for them. Let's see.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Oh, there are so many things. We did so much. We traveled so much. We had so many
                    friends there. We were able to entertain anybody and everybody which was great.
                    One thing I did as DCM was invite every new person from every agency and even
                    long-term TDY's home for lunch with spouse which, of course, was not
                    representational. This was just in house. There were quite a lot of them,
                    particularly TDYers. It seems people appreciated it because there often wasn't
                    an ambassador there, and otherwise there wouldn't have been any proper
                    introduction to the embassy. I've met people since then who've come up and said,
                    “Oh, I remember coming to lunch at your house.” I mean, people who were from
                    other agencies or who were TDYers and said that it meant something to them.</p>
                <p>I remember going to Romanians' homes for dinner. Some of our best personal
                    memories were evenings and afternoons spent with Romanian friends. One of them
                    was a very prominent heart doctor whose son, Radu, had been one of the few
                    dissidents, actually, and spent time in jail for putting up Ceausescu fliers.
                    Dr. Filipescu invited us to his villa on Lake Snagov. We had a nice dinner and
                    were sitting around talking, and people just sort of gradually disappeared, and
                    we ended up just with Radu and his wife. It came time to leave, and we left, and
                    we looked in the house, and they were all inside watching Dallas. Dallas was
                    practically a disease, and no guest was too important to miss Dallas for! That
                    was an interesting bit of culture there. One of my duties as charg� was going to
                    National Days, and I remember going to the Mongolian National Day which was held
                    in a museum. It was the Geological Museum. We got in, and the doors were closed,
                    and we were served a drink, and then ushered into a room and shown for two hours
                    a Mongolian film of Mongolian opera with Romanian sub-titles, so at least I
                    could follow what was going on. Then we were let out, and the Mongolian charg�,
                    I don't think he was used to having Americans showing up at his event, so he was
                    very pleased. Every time I saw him afterwards, he just ran across the room to
                    say hello because the American charg� came and spent the whole evening watching
                    the Mongolian opera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Film.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Film. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as he got new ones, he came and told you he had yet
                        another one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, no! I think sub-titles meant that it wasn't that easy to get new
                    ones. He had one at least. There were a lot of interesting things. Another one,
                    on a sadder note, we were still and are still today trying to track down former
                    Nazis and so forth. I got a cable one day, a request from the Romanians, the
                    records for the man who had been my Romanian teacher at FSI who I knew had
                    right-wing sympathies. I don't know... He's innocent until proven guilty, and he
                    died before anything came up. They didn't produce anything, so I don't know what
                    if anything there was in the records, but these were little incidents that
                    occur.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>Another one was when Richard Nixon passed away. We had a condolence book, and we
                    took turns. It was at the American Center, formerly the American Library, and we
                    sat there. We took turns being there to greet ambassadors or others who came. An
                    interesting collection of people who came. Old Communists who met Nixon when he
                    visited in 1969 as well as official government people and others. One of the
                    very last people to come was an ambassador. His driver was with him, and his
                    driver had been the driver at the American embassy. He left under scandal, but
                    that's another story. The ambassador was in signing the book, and I saw the
                    driver there whom I'd known in the seventies, and I spoke with him, and we were
                    chatting a little bit, and he was shifting from one foot to another. I said,
                    “Would you like to sign the condolence book?” And he said, “You mean I'm allowed
                    to sign a condolence book?” I said, “Yes, its open to the public. You're welcome
                    to sign.” And he practically kissed my hands. He said, “You know, I drove for
                    Nixon when he was here in '69,” and something about being invited to come to the
                    States afterwards. He had met Nixon. He talked with Nixon. So he was just
                    absolutely delighted to sign the book. He felt it was his civic duty in a
                    way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Its 3:00. Why don't we maybe stop here, and we might have

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Tom Lantos had a long-standing interest in the region. In fact, it was
                    due to his insistence and, although no one would admit this officially, a branch
                    office of the embassy was set up in Cluj in the traditional heart of
                    Transylvania, traditional capitol of Transylvania to try to keep an eye on the
                    ethnic Hungarian situation there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you tell me just a little more about this branch
                        office? I think those are kind of curious, not too well known. Was there an
                        American officer? How was it structured?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>RICKERT: The idea was to have an American officer there and one or two FSN's. It
                    was decided to make it a branch office rather than a consulate or some other
                    type of office for a number of practical reasons. For one thing, if it was a
                    branch, the mayor of Cluj was and still is as of today a rabid nationalist,
                    anti-Hungarian named Gheorghe Funar about whom I could tell lots of stories but
                    won't at this point. I'll tell one, the public statement he made at one time. It
                    gives you a flavor of how he dealt with minority issues. He said publicly one
                    timthis was, of course in the previous century, the 20th Centurhe said, “We
                    Romanians have been in Budapest twice already this century, once after the First
                    World War and once after the Second World War. The next time we shouldn't be in
                    such a hurry to leave.” The kind of thing that didn't endear him to the ethnic
                    Hungarian populace which was shrinking and not terribly important numerically,
                    something under 20%, but still very important in the cultural and social and
                    other life of Cluj. He also insisted on raising statues to Romanian heroes and
                    painting all of the park benches in Cluj in Romanian national colors. Some
                    people saw humor in that since Hungarian posteriors were being placed on these
                    tri-colored park benches! In any case, by making it a branch office, the whole
                    deal was the responsibility of the central government and not the county or city
                    of Cluj. The branch office of the embassy...that becomes part of the bilateral
                    relationship between the United States whereas, at least in theory, a consulate
                    should not be set up without some kind of assent from the receiving city or
                    location. They skirted this in that way. Negotiating the opening of this thing
                    was quite difficult because Romanian officials told me that there had been quite
                    a debate within the Romanian government about allowing this. Some of the more
                    modern thinking people said, “If we allow the Americans to have something there
                    on a permanent basis, it will show them in a direct way that a lot of the
                    stories they hear aren't true, and it will actually improve our image and the
                    American understanding of what we're all about.” That was the viewpoint that
                    finally won out. I don't remember the exact date, but we found the premises in
                    the university and opened an office. It was to have an American officer, but we
                    didn't have anyone assigned for the first at least six months. So we sent people
                    from the embassy up on TDY for a week at a time, sometimes two weeks, mostly
                    officers, mostly pol and econ officers but sometimes consular or USIA or even
                    admin people would go up and man the office. We found a house for the eventual
                    American officer who was assigned there, an admin officer named Nate Bloom. I
                    remember calling Nate one time when we heard there was a riot in the main
                    square. I called him on an open phone line, and he said, “I can see the main
                    square from my window, and there's certainly no riot there.” So, in small ways
                    it proved its value. The other thing that happened was that the officer in
                    charge had an official car and did a lot of travel all over Transylvania, went
                    to villages and small towns, many of which had never been visited by an American
                    official before. I think, at least, it ended up enabling the embassy to show the
                    flag in a positive way at very small expense because housing and the premisewe
                    got the premises free as I recall from the university.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>RICKERT: We did have a flag, yes, outside the window. It was in part of the Cluj
                    University buildings, was two or three large rooms, a little bit of a public
                    affairs section with some newspapers and other such things, and an office for
                    the officer in charge there, and a couple of desks for the FSN's. It worked out
                    pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it receive visa applications?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. The only thing we would do on the visa side was provide information,
                    forms and so forth, that would be helpful to people who still had to go to
                    Bucharest to get their visas. They had in their hands information that they
                    normally would not have received in advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the State Department consider it a post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I don't know if it was officially considered a post, but de facto it was
                    a post, it functioned as a post. We had a weekly pouch that went out. It
                    functioned in every way as a post. There was a house for the officer in charge
                    that was provided, paid for, by the embassy. I think it was an interesting
                    experiment. It was not something that's been done in many places, at least not
                    in those particular circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it continuing as far as you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: It is still continuing. Major Funar is still there. One hopes that in
                    the June 5 elections that he will be replaced by someone of a more moderate
                    point of view, but he's still there at the moment. On the other hand, the more
                    serious concerns about the ethnic Hungarian minority that apparently Tom Lantos
                    had in mind when he requested that this office be opened in exchange for his
                    support for giving MFMost Favored Natiotreatment to Romania on a permanent
                    basis. That was the trade-off although probably all concerned would deny it, but
                    that's what it was. The real concerns about the Hungarian minority in that
                    region are no longer valid. They themselves did not justify having an office.
                    The Hungarian partthere is one party that represents the Hungarian minoritis a
                    de facto part of the government and has been for some time now. Although one can
                    never say that an ethnic minority is ever satisfied with what it gets from the
                    majority, even allegations of ethnic mistreatment are very, very few and far
                    between and, let's face it, sometimes ethnic X doesn't like ethnic Y not because
                    they are of different ethnic groups but because they just don't like each other.
                    That can happen in Romania or any other place. So everything that happens to a
                    Hungarian, bad that happens to a Hungarian, an ethnic Hungarian, to my mind
                    shouldn't automatically attributed to ethnic tension or strife or hatred of some
                    sort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The officer in charge of this branch office was sort of
                        responsible for a region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes, that's correct, unofficially. Since it wasn't a consular district,
                    it wasn't an official designation, but we mapped out an area that he was
                    responsible for. Essentially, much of Transylvania, not the whole, because some
                    of Transylvania goes all the way toward the eastern part of the country, but all
                    of western Transylvania and Von Not which is the south western most part of
                    Romania which is nearest to Yugoslavia. As I said, the first incumbent, the only
                    one during my time there, was very active in getting out and about, and he did
                    quite a bit of reporting, and it was unclassified, unsensitive, faxed to us at
                    the embassy, and then we re-transmitted it. He developed a good feel about what
                    was going on in that part of the country, and did things first like having the
                    first Fourth of July reception in Cluj which had ever been held under official
                    American auspices there. it was held on a different day than the one in
                    Bucharest, so it was possible to get some good representation up there from the
                    embassy which added to the flavor of the occasion. I think all of us thought at
                    the time that this was done that it was largely a favor to Tom Lantos in order
                    to get something that the administration wanted. Eventually, I think... Opinions
                    vary. During my time it was considered to be on the whole a worthwhile office
                    and operation. My successor had different views. I don't know what the current
                    opinion is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM supervised that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. Well, I did during the time I was there, and one of the problems
                    from the officer in charge's point of view was that he was put under the
                    political counselor after I left, and he didn't feel that he had the access to
                    the front office that he had had previously. I think there was a matter of
                    personalities and so forth. But he reported directly to me, and then I did his
                    efficiency report. The ambassador reviewed it, and he got a promotion out of it,
                    so he was pleased. But the political section got everything that he wrote, and
                    they either edited it and sent it in or incorporated it into their regular
                    reporting. They would task him with things saying, “We heard this or that,” and
                    “Could you check it out for us?” I think, you'd probably agree, that a major
                    problem with embassies in general is that they become capital centric, and they
                    become very much tied down and tied up with what's going on in the capital.
                    Their viewpoints are perhaps skewed in some cases by what they see and hear and
                    know perhaps very well and very correctly from the capital. But the United
                    States isn't Washington, DC, and the United Kingdom isn't London, and Paris
                    isn't France.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>RICKERT: No, none had set up a branch of an embassy, but as I recall at least the
                    French, British and Germans had sort of USIS operations there with library
                    student advising information of that kind. So Nate did have some European
                    colleagues with whom he could consort up there but they were in a slightly
                    different business although our office did do some of that kind of work as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested in this for several reasons. One, I'm
                        interested in the question of Cyprus these days. There is an office in
                        northern Cyprus, but it doesn't fly the flag, isn't called an embassy branch
                        office, and I think that would make sense if it were. But the other is that
                        I've thought for a long time that when you have a consulate general headed
                        by a consul general, you quickly get into the pattern that it has to be kind
                        of a large place: it needs to have visa officers; it has to have an
                        administrative section; probably needs a security officer these days; it
                        probably needs a political economic officer; it may need a deputy, and
                        pretty soon you have a large post, and then it gets expensive and there are
                        other issues. I thought, “If you could only keep it small!” One officer with
                        maybe a few foreign service national employees and a flag pole, then you can
                        do really quite a bit, so I'm glad it worked in Romania. I think it is
                        working in France and a few other places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's what I was going to say. A colleague from my present office is in
                    Lyon, and he's doing this there as a one-American operation. I haven't seen him
                    in a while, so I don't know exactly how its working, and its not called a branch
                    as opposed to an embassy. I don't think they have a special nomenclature for
                    these posts in France. I know before he went out he was very enamored of the
                    idea. I think he has a classified fax so that he can send things to Paris if he
                    needs to, but 98% of what he does, I'm sure, is completely unclassified and
                    open. For a very small price, you've got an American presence in a country like
                    that. He has a very good level of French, he can do all sorts of things not only
                    in the city but around elsewhere. One problem with Nate Bloom was that when he
                    arrived he didn't have Romanian. There was no time to train him. The deal was
                    that he would study Romanian at the university for four hours a day at the
                    beginning and then work at the office for the rest of the day. I'm not sure what
                    level he reached, but by the time I left, he had a good working knowledge of
                    Romanian which was a lot more important in a provincial city like Cluj than it
                    would be in Bucharest. The officers who've been sent since have had the full FSI
                    course, so we presume they have a more than adequate level of Romanian.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: Lawrence Eagleburger came at one point. There was an interesting nuance
                    or aspect of U. S.-Romanian relations that came out of that visit. The
                    ambassador said, “What we'll do is we will hold a lunch, and we will invite whom
                    we want from the Romanian government but also from other communities,
                    minorities, churches, opposition parties and so forth.” Nastasi was the foreign
                    minister at the time. He said, “No, we're the hosts. We'll hold the luncheon,
                    but you can do the list.” So, they gave a very nice luncheon for Eagleburger.
                    They invited everyone we asked including the chief rabbi and a lot of opposition
                    people and NGO people and so forth. I thought it was important. It marked a
                    shift in the old thinking that the ruling party controls everything and does
                    what it wants to showing the beginning of the understanding that in a democracy
                    you've got to deal with even those who are opposed to you, who criticize you,
                    who share in different goals and objectives. It worked out fine, and the
                    luncheon was a success.</p>

                <p>One of the more interesting though politically unimportant people was a man named
                    Lucien Horowitz. The DCM residence in Bucharest was built 1944 to 1946, and it
                    was built by the parents of Lucien Horowitz who as you might guess were Jewish.
                    Lucien left with his parenthe was about 18 in March 194turned over the keys to
                    the house to an American colonel who was there, fully expecting that they would
                    be back in a relatively short time. Didn't take anything out of the house. His
                    parents settled in Switzerland; he went to London, made a successful career as a
                    commodities broker. According to his wife he built a house very much like the
                    DCM's residence, in countryside outside of London. He had business in Romania
                    and used to come back from time to time. He called up one time and introduced
                    himself, and we invited him over and showed him... He was reluctant. He was a
                    real British gentleman. My wife insisted, and she said, “I want you to see the
                    whole house, attic to basement, garage, the works.” It was fascinating going
                    around through the house with him because his parents designed it, and he
                    explained the reasons for different things, the balcony, the living room,
                    because his mother played the piano there for guests on this balcony. The zodiac
                    signs on the ceiling in the what was called the gasieniera, sort of a guest room
                    down in the basement, a serving table in the dining room. Italian stone carvers
                    had carved the fireplace. He was eager to get the house back which as far as I
                    know he hasn't. He said if he got it back, he would sell it or rent it to the
                    Americans because they had taken good care of it in all those years. The most
                    moving thing that happened was when we were showing him around the upstairs. We
                    took him into my son's bedroom. He was there doing his homework. Mr. Horowitz
                    had been very controlled up to that point, and he looked at the floor and saw
                    wall-to-wall carpet as there is in this room here, and he said, “That's a pity
                    because there is a beautiful floor” and mentioned that he had been there when
                    the workmen had put in the last piece in the floor. Then he said, “You know,
                    this was my bedroom when I lived in this house.” He really teared up a little
                    bit, and he looked at my son who was not that much younger than he was when he
                    left. In a very Romanian gesture, he reached into his wallet and pulled out a
                    bank note with Romanian king, I don't remember if it was Caroll or Yihad
                    Michael. We introduced him to our son, and he said, “Jonathan, I've been
                    carrying this bank note with me ever since we left Romania, and I want you to
                    have it,” and gave it to him which was a very nice gesture. We became very
                    friendly with him, saw him every time he came. He also told stories about how
                    while they were building it, the living room ceiling in that house is about 24'
                    high and how they played volleyball in the living room. They set up a net with
                    his friends and played volleyball.</p>

                <p>The difference between Romania in the '70s and Romania in the '90s: In the '70s
                    the embassy had a villa that was paid for by the embassy and could be used for
                    weekend R&amp;R and other purposes of relaxation by embassy staff. It was in the
                    town of Sinaia which is a mountain resort town with the summer royal palace of
                    the Romanian royal family, a place called Pele? is located. It was a nice place.
                    It wasn't particularly modern and had a tiny kitchen, but the air was great,
                    there were a lot of good hikes, and skiing nearby. It was a disappointment to my
                    wife and me when we arrived back in '91 to find that that villa was no longer
                    available. We learned that Ceausescu had forced the embassy out of that villa
                    because it was too close to one that he was occupying, and he just didn't want
                    “foreign spies” around. We had gotten another one that was further up the road
                    near the railroad tracks, and either by design or by accident, the trains which
                    were many going up and down those tracks, always tooted as they went past
                    regardless of the time of day or night. My wife got together with some other
                    people and said, “Why don't we see if we can find a better villa than the new
                    one.” So they made a committee, and to make a long story short, they ended up
                    back in the old villa which had become available which was very nice for us. it
                    was nearer, it was nostalgic, it had been upgraded since we were there, and we
                    had a lot of fun. Inspectors subsequently came through and decided the villas in
                    all these posts paid for by the embassy were no longer justified and so they
                    disappeared, but it was fun while it lasted.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I mentioned the 24' ceiling in our living room. One of the things that we did, my
                    wife being Swedish in particular, we always had a Christmas tree of maximum
                    height, right up to the ceiling. The last two years at least, we invited
                    Romanians for a big Christmas party. It was very touching to be told by more
                    than one persoby several people, “You know, during the dark years, we could see
                    the tree in the DCM's residence, and it was always a sign of hope to us. We
                    never imagined that we could actually be here celebrating Christmas around the
                    tree,” which was a very moving testament to the efforts of predecessors who had
                    lived in that house. One things we did, not directly as an embassy, but as the
                    U. S. government while I was there, because of the conflict in Yugoslavia, of
                    course, there were sanctions on exports from Yugoslavia. Romania, Bulgaria,
                    Hungary and a number of other countries had U. S. customs teams that were called
                    SAMS or Sanctions Assistance Missions that operated, had a base in the embassy
                    but had teams out along the borders trying to assist local customs with
                    interdiction of one sort or another. This was a mixed blessing from an
                    administrative point of view and other points of view because the folks that
                    came out from U. S. customs were professional customs people, but many of them
                    had never been to a place like Romania before. They were a little bit blue-eyed
                    about what they were told and what they saw. They came for short periods. They
                    were TDYers, so you'd just get one group having a real sense of what was going
                    on and why, and then they'd be gone and a new group would come in. Plus there
                    were the usual problems that one can have from time to time with TDYers who are
                    away from family or other inhibitions from their normal daily existence. My wife
                    worked as a PIT for the customs team in Bucharest which avoided the conflict of
                    interest situation because I didn't control the sanctions assistance mission.
                    They have their own. I mean, they reported to the ambassador, but there was a
                    separate operation. I must say that she as a Romanian speaker and one who knew
                    the country extremely well was a huge help to them because she knew how things
                    worked and didn't work and was able to give them advice on some of their hiring.
                    They picked some of the sleaziest people that I've encountered in Romania. It
                    has more than its fair share, and she was able just by knowing the language and
                    knowing the types, was able to help them avoid some problems that they might
                    have had otherwise. The sanctions teams were, I would say, of limited
                    effectiveness, but they were a useful step forward in developing post-Communist
                    cooperation between our two governments in dealing with practical issues. From
                    that point of view, I think they were well worth their while. There were some
                    other things. My last day in Romania, full day, was July 4, 1995, and Alfred
                    Moses was ambassador. He was gone most of the time because his wife had a very
                    serious cancer. So he would spend three weeks in Washington and then a week in
                    Bucharest and then go back to Washington for three weeks. So, for the last three
                    months, I was charg� about three-quarters of the time. He was supposed to be
                    there for July 4, but he didn't make it. My wife and children had left by then,
                    so I had to host that reception to which President Iliescu and many others came.
                    It was a very nice farewell in a lot of respects because it brought together a
                    lot of people who had been close friends and colleagues and whose friendship I
                    valued. At the very end, the foreign minister, Teodor Melescanu, gave me a book,
                    a tourist-type book of Romania and a letter in it in Romanian which was a
                    compliment to me because he said, “I'm writing this in a language I know you
                    understand and love.” In part, he thanked me, and I'm quoting, “For exceptional
                    personal contribution to the development and amplification of Romanian-American
                    relations in all areas of common interest.” It also cited my many years in the
                    service of friendship, cooperation, and understanding between the Romanian and
                    American peoples and between the authorities and NGO's in both countries. That
                    was a very nice note on which to depart.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a very nice tribute. Its sort of unusual to
                        have your last official day be hosting a Fourth of July reception, but I
                        suppose that's happened elsewhere on occasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I left the next morning, but before going to bed that night, a local
                    radio station asked to do an interview which I did on the phone from my bedroom
                    at about 10:30 that night in Romanian, and the next morning up and out. So I was
                    on duty right up to the last minute. Ambassador Moses did get in actually that
                    evening but too late to host the reception. He came for the last part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you handed over...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I handed over...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...to him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, and you went back to Washington to be Director of
                        the Office of the North Central European Affairs in the summer of '95 and
                        were there, I guess, for three years. I guess the first question I have is
                        what countries are encompassed by North Central European Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: The creation of this office was due to a reorganization that Dick
                    Holbrooke carried out in EUR. I wasn't around in Washington when it happened,
                    but I gather that he believed that some of the offices had gotten too big and
                    too unwieldy. So he subdivided certain offices and made more of them but smaller
                    and did away with deputy directors, so one layer was reduced. North Central
                    Europe or NCE was created out of the old originally EUR/EE which then under
                    Eagleburger as assistant secretary for European affairs in the early '80s, it
                    became EEY, Eastern European and Yugoslav Affairs as it was when I was in the
                    office. It also covered the three Baltic states. There was a political desire
                    not to have them in the same bureaucratic unit as covered the Soviet Union
                    because that would be kind of a tacit recognition of the earlier absorption of
                    those countries. So it was handled out of EEY, and then when EEY was broken up
                    it was split into three. The three Baltic states went to a new Nordics and
                    Baltics office, EUR/NB. Six countries that were Poland, Czech and Slovak
                    Republics, Hungary, Romania, and Slovenia were considered to be North Central
                    Europe. The Romanians were delighted to be included with the rest of those
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though I would think that Romania and Slovenia and
                        what, Bulgaria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. Bulgaria was not. Bulgaria was in SCE, South Central Europe. So the
                    third office was South Central Europe which was all of Yugoslavia except for
                    Slovenia; that is, of the former Yugoslavia, plus Bulgaria and Albania. I have
                    some disagreements with the exact division of this, but I think it was certainly
                    a healthy thing for U. S.-Romanian relations that Romania was put together with
                    Hungary. It's an important rival of Hungary, but also they need each other in
                    different kinds of ways, not have them in different bureaucratic bailiwicks so
                    to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,
                        Romania, and Slovenia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Slovenia was clearly the odd man out in Yugoslavia, so that made good
                    sense. Anybody who's been to Slovenia knows its a lot more like Austria and
                    Italy than it is like the rest of Yugoslavia. Its so small that in one sense it
                    doesn't really matter. But the Romanian decision was an important one. The
                    Romanians are sensitive about being considered a Balkan country. Geographically,
                    they're not Balkan, but in terms of customs and psychology and other things,
                    there are many Balkan elements there. By being lumped in with the North Central
                    Europe, they were kind of extracted from the Balkans, bureaucratically if not in
                    fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the office director. There was no deputy, and how
                        many other officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: There was a desk officer for each of the six countries, and then there
                    was a regional economic officer who covered economic issues for the whole
                    region. The Poland desk officer was de facto deputy director because that was
                    the biggest country, most senior position. First was Trevor Evans, and then Jack
                    Pillsbury, they covered for me when I was absent and served in many ways as
                    deputies in addition to their rather expensive Poland duties. Their help was
                    greatly appreciated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an assistant Polish desk officer or only the
                        economic officer would help on economic issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Slovenia was not enough to keep a very active officer fully occupied. We
                    had political-military officer, too. I forgot about that. The Pol/Mil officer
                    had just come out of Warsaw, and was very current with the Poland situation. But
                    this leads me to something. We had very good people, not a dud in the lot.
                    Bosnia was overshadowing everything, and rightly or wrongly, we were viewed as
                    being overstaffed by the EUR front office, so whenever they needed someone, they
                    grabbed a body from our office. We lost people for months at a time, and we had
                    other gaps due to an early departure for language training and a maternity leave
                    and some other things. But it was the most flexible group of people that I've
                    ever worked with. Everyone understood what the situation was, and when there was
                    a gap and I asked for volunteers, I had a choice of volunteers, and it made the
                    management side of my job extremely easy. I even had people come and say, “I
                    don't have enough to do. What can you...” at different times. “Where is help
                    needed?” I don't say that's never happened, but I've never had that happen on
                    such a broad scale, really across the board. The office had the attitude that
                    we're covering the region, and its not the trade union attitude, “Its not my job
                    description. There's nothing here about covering for the Hungary desk officer or
                    the Czech desk officer. I've got enough to do with my own country.” That made it
                    a much more enjoyable and much ,more productive experience than it might have
                    been otherwise.</p>
                <p>When I came in August of l995 after some leave, the DAS when I arrived was Bob
                    Frasure. I didn't know Bob well, but he'd been involved in selecting me for the
                    job, and I knew him somewhat. I always found him to be not only an
                    extraordinarily bright and knowledgeable person, but one of the great human
                    beings of the Foreign Service. So, it was hard that I learned within of a week
                    of my arrival that he had been killed in that terrible accident in Bosnia. He
                    was replaced by Marshall Adair for the first two years, and then Eileen Malloy
                    took over for the last year. Without criticizing or knocking either of the
                    latter in any way, I had a rapport with Bob Frasure that I never developed with
                    the other two. It was not only much more a huge human tragedy that his life was
                    lost, but it was personal and professional loss to me not to work with somebody
                    whom I knew somewhat and admired hugely. I went out to Andrews Air Force base
                    when his and Joseph Kruzel, a DOD official who was killed in that same accident,
                    coffins returned and went to the funeral. It was a very moving but extremely
                    sad, heartrending way to start one's tour. Bob would have been my immediate
                    supervisor during my time there. That happens. Its a reminder of the dangers and
                    vagaries of our profession that too often are not noted by the general
                    public.</p>

                <p>Holbrooke was there for a while and then was followed by John Kornblum and
                    finally was followed by Marc Grossman. Holbrooke was not there for that long,
                    but he and Kornblum were really consumed by Bosnia and related issues, so they
                    didn't give a great deal of attentioand correctly sto my little patch of the
                    world. But nonetheless, there were things happening in our area. Most of the
                    countries were on a good track toward NATO EU, European integration. There were
                    two trouble spots; two out of six. Slovakia with Meciar, the prime minister, and
                    all that he represented, sort of buggish post-Communist, crummy Capitalist in
                    corruption. A little reform rhetoric, but very little reform in behavior, and
                    all sorts of nastiness going on there. And then Romania which, of course, I knew
                    well, had just come from, and knew was lagging behind the others. So I really
                    focused, I'd say, at least 80% of my attention to Slovakia and Romania knowing
                    that the very competent desk officers would take care of the rest and keep me
                    informed which they did. The biggest issue during my time there was NATO
                    enlargement. Our office for whatever reason did not play a central role in that
                    process, but we were involved in dealing with countries that were trying to get
                    in and the lobbyists of all stripes who came to make their case. It's a long and
                    complicated process. I have the impression that the ultimate decisions were
                    really made in Strobe Talbott's office and, of course, the decision was that
                    three could enter. There were five who could be considered serious candidates.
                    The three that got in, Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary, and then next a very
                    close fourth was Slovenia, and then Romania wasn't what I'd say distant fifth,
                    but it was considerably behind Slovenia. There was an obvious debate within the
                    administration involving the White House and Talbott and then the EUR front
                    office. Not a lot of it drifted down below that level about who should get in. I
                    made the argument that if you weren't going to take all five, then you should
                    take three, the reason being that if Slovenia went in with the first group, it
                    would be much harder to have a second round with one country, Romania, then with
                    two or more. Ron Asmus, who was the DAS in the front office, a political
                    appointee, very knowledgeable, Rand corporation alumnus and an excellent person
                    to deal with, did a lot of the NATO expansion work for EUR. I had the impression
                    that he accepted this logic. Whether that made a difference in the end or not, I
                    don't know. Slovenia was so small and had so little military that it really
                    didn't matter one way or another, but it did matter from a practical point of
                    view for further enlargement of NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was probably a further argument in that Slovenia was
                        a part of the dissolution of Yugoslavia which, “If I'd only been independent
                        a few years,” while it was as you said very different from the other former
                        Yugoslav republics, it was still from that background, and it seems to me
                        that you could argue just strictly from an old Yugoslav point of view, it
                        was better to wait a little bit longer compared to Poland, the Czech
                        Republic, at least, and Hungary. At any rate, that's what happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's an interesting point. It was never stated to me outright, but I
                    found when I came in '95 that there was still, I found in various ways, there
                    was still within the bureaucracy, I would say more than lingering resentment
                    against Slovenia for having in effect precipitated the dissolution of
                    Yugoslavia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that happened at a time where U. S. policy was very
                        much to try to keep it together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: That's correct. It started in the summer of '91. I was in Sweden about
                    to go to Romania. I remember seeing the mini civil war between Serb forces and
                    Slovenia forces, it would have been in July of '91, on the Swedish television. I
                    found in talking with people, I don't want to use too strong a word, a reticence
                    about Slovenia partly because of this role that they had played. They, as it was
                    viewed, had pursued their own interests rather than the interests of the greater
                    good of Yugoslavia. Although I don't think that anyone would say that they were
                    responsible for the dissolution of Yugoslavia, they certainly opened the door to
                    what eventually happened. The Slovenian ambassador to the U. S. at that time was
                    a man named Petrich. He had been here even before we recognized Slovenia. We
                    took some time to recognize Slovenia's independence, and he'd been kind of a
                    shadow ambassador in Washington. He was a Slovenian/Yugoslav diplomat of
                    Slovenian origin and a very good professional. We became quite friendly during
                    the time that I was working in NCE. He'd mentioned diplomatically some of the
                    hurdles that he'd had to overcome in order to establish himself and Slovenia as
                    being legitimate partners for dialogue and for a normal relationship. He did it
                    without bitterness and without name-calling. I think he understood what the
                    reasons were. But he would say that Slovenia's job was to look after Slovenia
                    and two million people can't save the whole of Yugoslavia. If they hadn't moved,
                    he'd say they would have risked a worse fate, and they had to do what was best
                    for themselves, and the United States believes in self-determination, and why
                    didn't you believe in our self-determination? Something along those lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess one answer is we weren't all too keen on new

                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Oh, I'm sure there were reasons on the other side, but it was a bit of
                    an awkward situation. I've mentioned that the big problems were with Romania,
                    not bilaterally, but our big concerns were with Romania and Slovakia. There were
                    issues with Slovenia; not between us and Slovenia but between Slovenia and
                    Italy. Slovenia is a small country, and the issue was a small one, but it was a
                    very important one. There was a question of property restitution. There were
                    Italian citizens living in Slovenia at the end of World War II who owned houses
                    that were nationalized. In the 1990s there was a Nationalist government in Rome
                    which had its strength in the north, and they refused to allow Slovenia to get
                    EU associate member status until this old property issue was resolved. For
                    reasons that I couldn't recreate if I tried, it seemed thaand this is often the
                    casthat they really couldn't do it bilaterally, so we got pulled in. I was going
                    back over my desk calendar a few days ago, and saw the number of times that I
                    met with the Italian political consular who is now the political DCM here, by
                    the way, on this issue. I'd see him at least once a week and sometimes more
                    often. Stefano Stefanini was a very reasonable person, but he was representing
                    his government, and his government had a position which he had to defend and did
                    defend ably. But he personally recognized that it wasn't in Italy's ultimate
                    interest to have Slovenia as an EU member, and we worked at length with the
                    Slovenians and with the Italians to come up with the formula that provided for
                    compensation for the houses. In some cases the actual houses would be returned,
                    in some cases that wasn't possible. Eventually the Italians removed their hold,
                    so to speak, and Slovenia which has the highest per capita income of any country
                    of the former Communist world actually by a pretty good margin, over $10,000 a
                    year, was able to get on the EU track and now as we speak is an EU member.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Want to talk about Slovakia a little bit and what you did
                        with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. Slovakia was eager to gain admission to NATO. They really thought
                    that because Czechoslovakia had been on track that even if split off that it
                    wouldn't affect anything. They would just slide in as they would have had they
                    remained part of Czechoslovakia. This breakup took place I believe in January of
                    '93, so it was just a couple of years later that this happened. The U. S.
                    watched with growing dismay the way in which Prime Minister Meciar and his
                    cronies were running the country. Although they often said the right things, it
                    was clear that the privatizations were being done in a very thuggish, corrupt
                    way. The President of Slovakia, Mikhail Kov�? who had been an ally of Meciar at
                    an earlier stage, took stands against Meciar. His son ended up being drugged and
                    put into the trunk of a car and taken to Austria and dumped.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>RICKERT: The president of Slovakia is a head of state with very limited powers.
                    But in a young republic, its an important non-partisan position even if a person
                    comes from the party, he or she is there as a representative of the people, not
                    of any party or group. Some people who revealed what was going on. one former
                    secret policeman was killed; others were terrorized in different ways. There was
                    a lot of pre-'89 nastiness going on. Ted Russell was the ambassador at first,
                    and he had a real frosty relationship with Meciar. As things got worse, he was
                    replaced by Ralph Johnson who also was not on buddy-buddy terms with Meciar.
                    Ralph, in addition, as things got worse, went around the country making speeches
                    in Slovak which stated the U. S. position. He was polite and correct. He didn't
                    trash anybody, but you didn't have to be psychic about what he was driving at.
                    And then Meciar would complain about the American ambassador getting involved in
                    internal affairs and so forth and so on. So we used every opportunity to pass
                    the message to Meciar and his various cronies and henchman that they could do
                    whatever they wanted to in their own country but don't ask us to support it or
                    accept it. One of the first things that I did as office director was to go on a
                    trip with Secretary of Defense Perry to visit four of the countries. This was
                    late September, early October '95, and I went to Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and
                    Czech Republic. That, of course, was a very interesting trip for me. I'd never
                    been along on a trip of that sort. I'd been on the receiving end of visits but
                    never along as one of the party. I won't go into all the details, but I found
                    Perry to be an extraordinarily effective diplomat. He was very good and clear in
                    explaining what was necessary for countries to do to get into NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he interested in your views of how to accomplish these
                        goals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. He drew on a lot of different people. I was one of many. Joe Nye
                    was on this trip, and Dan Fried of the NSC, and others. So I was relatively a
                    junior figure, but in his staff meetings he asked everybody what they thought
                    and had a very open and very collegial manner. A real gentleman and a very fine
                    person, and I think he had an excellent sense of what was going on and what had
                    to happen in the region. He annunciated something called “The Perry Principles.”
                    The EU had very specific, rigid hoops that have to be jumped through for a
                    country to get ibringing their legislation into accord with the EU and all sorts
                    of very specific things that had to be done. NATO never had anything like that.
                    Perry had to, I think, distill the essence of what we expected of new NATO
                    members. There were obvious things like no border disputes, no internal
                    interethnic conflicts. I mean not that life was perfect but that there were no
                    open running sores as far as interethnic relations were concerned, civilian
                    control of the military, and a number of things like that. I remember his
                    meeting with Meciar, polite, but I view it as “the gentlemen meets the buck.” It
                    was Meciar with Briefy a former boxer and looked like he's been on the losing
                    end in a few of his matches, and clearly in charge: rough, gruff, tough. Perry
                    who didn't flinch, didn't back off, didn't raise his voice, but spelled out very
                    clearly, “Mr. Prime Minister, Slovakia will be most welcome in NATO when this,
                    this, this, this, and this happen.” Meciar didn't like it but didn't stalk out
                    or anything like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>During that visit we also met with the head of the parliament, a man named
                    Gasparovich who was a Meciar acolyte who gave the same Meciar line in slightly
                    more polite terms and, interestingly, later broke with Meciar not on ideology,
                    but Meciar left him off the list during election for a seat in parliament. So he
                    made his own party. And the way the wheel turns, he is now president of Slovakia
                    because through some strange turns of events, he and Meciar in the last election
                    a few weeks ago ended up as the two leading winners, neither of them really
                    acceptable to the west, but Gasparovich was probably the lesser of two
                    evils.</p>
                <p>Late that year the Romanian president Ion Iliescu came to the States, had
                    meetings in Washington, and then he had his own presidential plane and flew out
                    to the west coast. He went to Seattle and then to Los Angeles and I was asked by
                    EUR to accompany him as representative of the department. That was really very
                    interesting to watch the interplay between him and the other higher-ups in the
                    Romanian government as well as a whole slew of hangers on of various sorts and
                    varying degrees of respectability. We went through the Boeing plant and were
                    received at Microsoft, and so it was for me being part of a foreign delegation
                    seeing Boeing and Microsoft through their eyes rather than as an American
                    because I was on this group. He was very well received in Seattle and a former
                    FSO, who was head of the Foreign Affairs Council up there, Ron Woods, put on a
                    really nice dinner. Boeing did some really good things. They pulled together
                    people from the northwest who had adopted children in Romania, and they had a
                    meeting with Iliescu along with many of the children. It was heartwarming to see
                    how these kids at least appeared to be thriving and doing very well in their new
                    environment. Then we went down to Los Angeles. Los Angeles is one of the largest
                    centers of Romanian �migr�s, so there were some pickets and some other
                    unpleasantness. Iliescu was...I wouldn't say demonized by the United States, but
                    because of his role or presumed role in the calling in of the coal miners in
                    June '90, after the first election, and subsequently some people considered him
                    a more evil person than he really is. He's a politician and a very smart
                    politician. He's made some mistakes, and he has some blind spots, but ultimately
                    he wants what's best for Romania. That's much more important than ideological
                    attachments that he may have had growing up as the son of an early Communist and
                    all the rest. He's never going to change his fundamental way of thinking. His
                    reactions are formed by his youth and middle age, and he's now 73. But he knows
                    in his head where the future is, and he's doing everything possible to help
                    within his lights, by his lights, to help Romania get to that future that he
                    thinks is not only inevitable but desirable.</p>

                <p>RICKERT: It was a major, major issue during my time in Romania, the first part
                    especially. I arrived in July '91. There had been a huge rush of adoptions right
                    after the revolution when the horrendous situation in the Romanian orphanages
                    became public; cases of pediatric AIDS, of malnourishment, of virtual
                    abandonment. horrible, horrible pictures and stories. There was one family in
                    the embassy who adopted twins shortly before I arrived. These young boys, twin
                    boys, they were a year and a half old when they were adopted, and they were at
                    that age unable to sit up. Neither one had any serious health problems. There
                    were many who had serious health problems. It was a horrible situation. There
                    were a lot of people who came from the States as well as from England, France,
                    Germany, Spain, Italy to adopt out of humanitarian motives. I think, and this is
                    a subjective judgment on my part, but I think after that first wave of
                    humanitarian angst over this situation, then a lot of people who wanted to adopt
                    for the usual reasons said, “Gee. Here's a situation where there are a lot of
                    abandoned kids, and maybe we can find a child here.” I'm not impugning their
                    motives, but it was a little bit different from the initial ones. What happened,
                    in short, is the system was not designed to handle this and huge amounts of
                    corruption got involved. A lot of money was made. Under pressure from us and
                    others the Romanians in July of '91 put a moratorium on adoptions. This has
                    happened at least twice since then. Its still an issue right today as we speak.
                    Its a major issue in Romania. I read today the embassy press summary, most of
                    which is about adoptions. What happened at that time was that there were some
                    hundred American families partly into the adoption process. Some of them even
                    had taken... I won't say taken possession, but they had taken over the children
                    that they were going to adopt pending completion of the paperwork and all the
                    rest.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The adoption moratorium began in July of 1991 under which the Romanians refused
                    to allow anyone to be adopted, period, after a certain date. My best
                    recollection is about a hundred American families had children in various stages
                    of the process, and in some cases had had the children with them and had bonded
                    with them and all the rest. It was a very traumatic experience for these people.
                    A lot of them, I'm sure, had paid a lot of money to get to where they were. And
                    then there were others who took advantage of the situation and did things that
                    they shouldn't do after the moratorium had been announced. In any case, we ended
                    up with a great deal of pressure from the American adoptive parents, a great
                    deal of pressure from the U. S. Congress. I had a call from a U. S. senator on
                    one case, personally. I had a call from the head of the Consular Bureau (CA),
                    Mary Ryan, on another case. Neither said anything that could not be taped and
                    played in public. There was no pressure in anything they said, but DCMs don't
                    normally get calls from assistant secretaries and U. S. senators about specific
                    cases. Just the fact of the call was a form of pressure and, of course, endless
                    congressional letters of one sort or another, calls from congressmen and others.
                    We worked very hard with the Romanians. To the Romanians' credit, I think the
                    more sensible people saw that at least there were a number of folks who were
                    genuinely caught in a bind that was not of their own making and that their cases
                    should be taken care of. To make a long story short, most of them were, but it
                    was a very, very painful process. We had a lot of difficulties with Romania at
                    that time, U. S.-Romania relations. I remember one week when I met three times
                    with the foreign minister, once with the president, and once with the
                    president's equivalent of national security advisor just on adoptions. It was
                    the only issue that Washington had any interest in. It was disturbing to me
                    because, while I didn't think it was unimportant, I thought: Here we are. We're
                    calling these people unreconstructed Communists, yet we're demanding that they
                    give us what we want, and we're not putting any carrots there at all. Its just,
                    “You have to do what we want.” To my mind, one of the less attractive features
                    of Big American throwing its weight around in a poorer country. But the
                    instructions were there, and I tried to do it as diplomatically as I could. In
                    any case, either the parents gave up and left or the cases were resolved within
                    six months or so. The last cases were in the spring of '96. Then adoptions were
                    not a serious issue during the rest of my time there, but its come back in
                    various guises and, as I said, its now a serious issue again even as we
                    speak.</p>

                        North Central European Affairs. You were not the administrative backstop of

                        there anything special we should say about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>RICKERT: You know, this might sound like its punting, but these were very well
                    run embassies which with high quality professional staff, it didn't need much
                    hand holding. They did have administrative issues with enlarging schools and
                    getting new premises and, to some extent, security, even pre-9/11 security was a
                    growing concern. The Indian ambassador was shot two blocks from my residence in
                    Bucharest by sick terrorists. He had been chief of police in Punjab and
                    apparently knocked a few heads, and they came to Romania and got him. That
                    caught the attention of the security people. In Romania at the end of '96 there
                    were presidential and parliamentary elections. There was a lot of concern in the
                    department that the ruling party, Iliescu's party, if it lost it might not give
                    up power. The opposition was a mixed bag of old �migr�s and people who
                    represented liberal, peasant, Christian, democrat, other right-of-center
                    viewpoints for the most part with very little experience in government or in
                    management because there were former Communists among them. They really were a
                    group of people that had limited experience in developing the skills that were
                    needed for government. The election was held in November of 1996, and I arranged
                    to get myself over as an observer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whose auspices were you an observer for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>RICKERT: I was an unofficial observer. In all the elections, the embassy sent
                    groups of people all over, and we did our own observing. We did that during my
                    time as DCM there, and we did it subsequently. Of course we coordinated with
                    OFC's and with other groups that were doing observing, but we were not part of
                    an official observing arrangement. A young embassy officer and I went down south
                    of Bucharest to Giurgiu, the Danube River port at one end of the only bridge
                    across the Danube between Romania and Bulgaria. The countryside around there was
                    known as “Iliescu country,” and I wanted to go to an area where Iliescu was
                    considered a good guy and observe there. Romanians are very talkative, and I
                    speak the language. We did the observing which was fairly desultory. I don't
                    think you really saw a whole lot in terms of incorrectness, and you see minor
                    violations, two in a booth and non-regulation ballot boxes, but mostly you don't
                    see major violations. But you can talk to people, and Romanians are very
                    talkative, and I talked to a lot of people, and they said, “Well, you know, the
                    other guys have been in since '90, and life is worse than it was when they came
                    in, so its time to try somebody else.” This is an agricultural area. These were
                    not city intellectuals or anything like that. These were ordinary folks. I
                    thought, “Gee, they've learned a fundamental lesson of democracy,” that you
                    don't need to vote only for whom you'd like to see in, but you can vote against
                    the person that you'd least like to see in. That's what I believe happened. I
                    believe that one of the big mistakes that was made by the opposition which did
                    win and President Constantinescu who did win, and of course the former elected
                    governor did turn everything over completely correctly and without any muss or
                    fuss at all. There was no cause for concern. They didn't leave a whole lot in
                    the national bank account because they did a lot of spending prior to the
                    elections, but that has happened in other countries beside Romania. I think the
                    inexperienced people who came into power viewed their election as a vote for
                    them rather than a vote against the previous crowd. I think if they looked it as
                    a vote against the previous crowd, they might have gone about their efforts to
                    rule a bit more carefully and more thoughtfully. Constantinescu became
                    president, and then the decisions were going to be made on NATO. Not all that
                    long afterwards the initial decision with Cintra in Portugal there was sort of a
                    NATO summit, and all the potential invitees were involved, and Constantinescu
                    went, met with Talbott there. I wasn't there, but I heard as a sign of his
                    political naivet� the main thing he wanted to talk to Talbott about was getting
                    a replacement for the U. S. ambassador...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: ...to Bucharest, Alfred Moses because he considereand I might say in an
                    asidnot entirely without justification that Moses was in tight with the Iliescu
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The previous government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>RICKERT: The previous government. And, therefore, he didn't trust him. I don't
                    think he really understood what ambassadors were supposed to do, but he
                    apparently viewed Moses as “their” guy, and he wanted “his” guy, whomever that
                    might be, to come in as ambassador. The criticism was not totally without merit,
                    but because Moses was there about a week a month, when he came he really honed
                    in on the government people, and he spent his time with the people who were in a
                    position to make things happen. I think a career person would have seen the need
                    to cultivate the opposition more than he did, but his attitude seemed to be that
                    they didn't have power now, and they were more than a little feckless, so it was
                    a waste of time to spend time with them. All of that was true except for the
                    waste of time because even feckless oppositions can be voted in if not on their
                    own merit but because the electorate doesn't want the present government to
                    continue which is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did Ambassador Moses stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: He stayed for his whole three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About through '97.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a year or so after the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>RICKERT: That's right. And he developed good working conditions with
                    Constantinescu, but I don't think Constantinescu ever really trusted him. He was
                    the guy who was in bed with the other guys, and we have to work with him because
                    they won't replace him, but anyway, that's my subjective judgment of the
                    situation. All during that spring the Romanians had this idea that the bad guys
                    are out, the good guys are in, the Democrats are in, now there's no reason not
                    to let us into NATO. If we just say so often enough and loud enough and through
                    enough different voices, the west will accept us. That whole spring, even after
                    Cintra, when it was clear that it was going to be the three, we had endless
                    delegations and, of course, from Romania, most of them were people I knew. They
                    all said exactly the same thing, and it was not really very productive, but
                    that's the way they went about it. Its a shame because if they put all of their
                    energy into fixing things up at home, they might have been further along. They
                    came in on a reform platform, but they couldn't really carry out the reforms
                    that they were talking about and make the push for NATO simultaneously. They
                    didn't have the resources. So they kind of pushed the reforms aside and really
                    focused on NATO which was more or less a losing proposition from the start. So
                    by the time the decisions had been made and the summit had been held which
                    invited the three new NATO members, I think it was in Prague, but I can't recall
                    for certain , that summer, they'd lost their chance. I think its a political
                    truism that if you're going to strike with reforms, you really need to hit hard
                    early because you lose momentum afterwards. After that summit, the U. S.
                    government sent high level delegations to the invitees and to the near misses.
                    Clinton went to Warsaw and to Bucharest. I don't know where else. I went to
                    Bucharest for his visit there, and Secretary Albright was along with him. She
                    went with him to Prague, Warsaw, Bucharest, maybe another stop that I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Budapest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No. Perry went to Budapest because they were in. If I recall, the summit
                    was in Prague then Warsaw was the most important post. Bucharest was the most
                    important one that didn't get in, so Clinton went to those two. I think there
                    was a Baltic state involved in this travel. I was there for Clinton's visit.
                    There haven't been, many presidential visits to Bucharest. Nixon went in '69,
                    Ford went in '75, and I think Clinton was the first after that.</p>

                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>RICKERT: Bush went as vice president but not as president. The present President
                    Bush has been there. So this was a big deal. I've been there for the Ford visit,
                    so I'd seen it under Communist times. It was very interesting from a lot of
                    points of view, but I'll just mention a couple of things. Clinton came in. He
                    didn't even overnight. It was a one-day stay, but the Romanians went all out.
                    Unlike Ford, they didn't let people out of work, they didn't order people to go.
                    They were setting uthe White House advance folkwere setting Revolution Square,
                    University Square, which is right in the center of town for the speech. Clinton
                    was to make a major speech. Constantinescu was to follow with his own speech.
                    They had an elaborate dais there. This is on a street called Boulevardo Niguero
                    which is a long boulevard. It's at least a mile, six lanes wide, very spacious.
                    They had it arranged so there was a confined space within the university where
                    you could fill it up with 15,000 people. I said to the White House advance man,
                    “Jonathan, why are you doing it this way? You're going to have a big crowd here,
                    and why not turn it so you can see down the boulevard and see these thousands of
                    people. It would be a great shot.” “Oh, no, we can't. Only about 40,000 turned
                    out in Warsaw and they got in, and the Romanians may not be happy that they
                    didn't get in, and they might not show up. We've got to set it up so we maximize
                    the PR.” I said, “Jonathan, I guarantee a minimum of 100,000 people. Minimum. “
                    And, “No, no. We can't do it.” Anyway, in the end conservative estimates were
                    130 thousand, and they could have done it my way, but they knew best. That event
                    was very good. ClintoI'm not a huge admirer of Clinton in some ways, buhe had a
                    common touch and an ability to deal with people, I'm sure still does, that are
                    unmatched in my experience. He was just fantastic in dealing with people. I
                    really saw it work at a reception that was held in the presidential palace, a
                    place called Cotro Chen where the President Constantinescu invited 150, 200
                    people from many walks of life, government, political life, academia, church,
                    elsewhere. And Clinton was there, of course with his guards but moving very
                    freely, and he talked with people everywhere. It was almost like he was running
                    for election, and he looked at them, he focused on them, he connected with him
                    in a way that few other politicians that I've seen in action have been able to
                    do. One little anecdote about this: I was talking with the Roman Catholic
                    Archbishop, Archbishop Rovu whom I knew slightly and whom I ran into, and he
                    said to me, “I'm really embarrassed, but before I came here today a young boy
                    asked me if I would get President Clinton's autograph for him, and I don't
                    really want to ask the president for an autograph. It would be embarrassing.” He
                    went on and on, and I said to him, I didn't tell him to do it, but I said, “You
                    know, Clinton's a very friendly guy and either he'll say yes and give you the
                    autograph, or he'll say no in a way that doesn't make you feel embarrassed. So
                    either way, its fine, and don't worry about it.” And just then the Italian
                    ambassador who in my experience always feel that they own me, the Roman Catholic
                    hierarchy in Eastern Europe, came along and grabbed Archbishop Rovu who's the
                    Archbishop of Bucharest, and took him to meet with Clinton. And there were
                    guards and there were others, Italian ambassador and all these people around. I
                    was watching from a distance, and then after a while Rovu's head came up like
                    this. So he put his thumb in the air: thumbs up which... I didn't have a chance
                    to chat with him afterwards, but I felt that he got what he needed and was very
                    happy about it. On a less happy note, one of the things that the embassy decided
                    to do at this reception with people like me and embassy officers, was to ensure
                    that important people got to meet Secretary Albright who was there, but
                    obviously Clinton, the president, was then center of attraction. So knowing of
                    the Secretary's interest in minorities and other such issues, I grabbed the head
                    of the Hungarian party who was a good friend of mine and brought him over to the
                    Secretary and said, “Madame Secretary, this is Bella Marco, head of Boudenaray,
                    the Hungarian party, and he would be very pleased to meet you.” She said in
                    effect, “But what are you bringing him here to me for?” and turned away. So I
                    didn't waste any more time bringing people to meet with the Secretary. It had
                    been a long day for her, but I must say I was less than overwhelmed. I mean, she
                    exchanged a couple of words with him and then turned away and turned to aides,
                    and that was it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you took him over to meet the president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: No, I didn't take anyone to meet the President because there were others
                    who were doing that. I didn't meet the President myself, but I certainly watched
                    and as I said was very impressed. Mrs. Albright went to Slovenia, and another
                    near miss. She spent a day there, and I went along on that trip. She seemed
                    happier running her own show rather than playing second fiddle. I don't think
                    the purpose here is to bad mouth anybody, but I was disappointed in her
                    treatment of U. S. ambassadors to Slovenia. Vic Jackovich who wahe is retired
                    noa career officer with Yugoslav background and extensive professional
                    experience: former ambassador in Bosnia, ambassador in Slovenia, served a couple
                    of times in Yugoslavia as a USIA officer. I've known him since the early '80s.
                    We came with the Secretary and got settled, and Vic came up to me and said,
                    “What am I supposed to do?” I said, “I don't know.” He said, “Nobody from the
                    Secretary's party has asked me anything.” She said hello when he came out to the
                    airport, and that was it. He said, “I'm happy to talk to her about Slovenia,
                    about the people she will be meeting tomorrow, about the sensitivities, issues,
                    anything else, or even where a good restaurant is,” but she went with her little
                    group of people, and they went off to dinner at a restaurant, never spoke to the
                    ambassador. Could have invited him along just to chat but didn't. I thought this
                    was, shall we say, shabby treatment among other things. As you know far better
                    than I, one of the key things for an ambassador in any post is the symbols of
                    support from his or her higher levels. So the pictures one always sees of the
                    ambassador with Reagan, the ambassador with Bush, the ambassador with Clinton
                    that sit prominently in offices or front halls of residences with the Secretary
                    and those types of things are of some significance, and Albright did not do
                    that. Otherwise, she did an excellent job in every way. Was very, very good
                    there. But sometimes, it's the small things that stick in your mind. I mean, she
                    spoke with the president, the prime minister, met with key member of parliament,
                    both government and opposition, and was a real pro except for that one time.</p>

                <p>Going back a little bit before the NATO summit, one thing that I learned, a
                    lesson...this would have been in June '97 just before the final
                    announcement...the Romanian prime minister, he was their last card they played,
                    a man named Viktor Ciorbea, who was I think a decent soul but a very limited
                    person to be playing on the large stage, international relations. He came to
                    Washington and asked to meet with Talbott, had a decent meeting with Talbott.
                    Talbott didn't give him any hope that the U. S. position was going to change and
                    urged him not to lobby the Germans or others to cause problems for us which he
                    didn't do. He went up to New York, and we received a call from saying that he
                    must meet with Talbott again, he had important things to discuss with Talbott.
                    Talbott was a little bit put off but agreed to do it. The meeting was set for
                    one day, and the afternoon before I met with his senior aide, a man with the
                    interesting name of Constantin Dudu Ionescu. So Dudu Ionescu came in, and I
                    said, “Dudu, what does he want to talk about?” It was some minor stuff! It
                    wasn't anything important at all. This was in the afternoon. So I wrote it up
                    very carefully in an E-mail and sent it to Eric Edelman who was Talbott's senior
                    assistant about 6:00 in the evening and thought nothing further of it. The
                    meeting was 10 or 11 the next morning. Went into the meeting and Constantinescu
                    did exactly as Dudu Ionescu had said he was going to do. Talbott got irritated,
                    and Eric looked at me and said, “What is he here for?”, and I realized that Eric
                    hadn't read the E-mail. I don't say this at all as a criticism of anybody except
                    myself: I learned then you don't just send an E-mail, especially to busy people
                    in busy offices. You make sure that more than one person gets it, then you call
                    to make sure that they've gotten it because a lot of embarrassment and nothing
                    of terrible consequence happened as a result of this but what could have been
                    handled much more skillfully by... I don't blame Talbott for not doing it
                    skillfully. If he had the information, he would have done it. I've seen him in
                    action many times, and he was excellent with these people, but not knowing what
                    I knew and what I sent to Eric, he didn't know how to react, and it was my
                    fault. So, there it is, a mistake I haven't made since.</p>
                <p>I'll mention another Clinton vignette. In February of 1997 he received
                    credentials from ambassadors and two previous sessions had been postponed; one,
                    since the government was closed, and then the second because of a huge snowstorm
                    we had. So, when he finally got around to it in February in 1997, there were ten
                    ambassadors which he did at once. The Romania Ambassador was Marasjed Juana whom
                    I've known since he was a mid-level diplomat in the foreign ministry and knew
                    his wife. Normally the desk officers did this, but I wanted to do the Romanian
                    one because I knew the ambassador so well. So I took him over. It was kind of a
                    zoo with all of the families and everyone else in the holding pen waiting for
                    Clinton to do this. I've never seen Clinton up close, so I was curious to see
                    how he behaved. Juana was number nine, and he was 35 at the time and he had his
                    wife and his three-year old and his six-month old daughter with him. We came
                    into the Oval Office, and they had the photographs and the normal chit-chat and
                    Alexandru, the boys, was like a normal three-year old, wanted to run around.
                    Clinton just smiled, and he had what looked to me to be a... I've seen pictures
                    of him in Kenya. The chiefs have this sort of this whisk. Its a piece of wood
                    with like horse hair at the end, a fly whisk of some sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Its a symbol of authority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. Like a scepter in a way. He had one on his desk, so he gave it to
                    Alexandru, and Alexandru was running around the Oval Office and shaking this,
                    and Clinton was laughing and obviously very fond of... I mean, you can fake some
                    things, but he was obviously very pleased to have this young boy, probably more
                    interesting than a bunch of late middle-aged grey-haired ambassadors. He had
                    read his talking points, he said everything he needed to say, he responded, he
                    knew where Romania was, he didn't mention Dracula. He did all the right things.
                    I was impressed. I often wondered what happened next because Number Ten on this
                    list was the Croatian ambassador who went in with his wife and four kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Small kids?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Small kids. Well, ranging from about four to twelve, something like
                    that. He probably finished with a flourish.</p>
                <p>I knew when I came to the job at NCE that I was in OC, and that I had to be
                    promoted during my time there in order not to tic (time-in-class) out. It was a
                    time of very few promotions from OC to MC, and indeed by looking at lists I
                    could see that office directors were almost not ever getting promoted. It was
                    ambassadors in small countries, DCM's in large posts, and so forth and so on.
                    Almost no office directors, so I was realistic about my chances even not taking
                    into amount of whether or not I deserved it on basis of performance, but as you
                    know very well, the decisions are made during the course of the summer, and
                    early in August a letter is sent to those who have ticked out. In my final year,
                    that would have been summer of '97, I sat very nervously sat through August
                    waiting for a letter which I didn't receive. I say nervously through September
                    for a letter which I didn't receive. The list came out if I recall, in early
                    October, and I couldn't believe that I was on it. But I thought, “How could I
                    not have been informed if I was not on it?” it came out, and I wasn't there. My
                    name wasn't there. I asked the EU/EX director Don Hayes who is a friend and who
                    knew about these things, and he said, “Oh, I've seen the list from EUR of the
                    people who ticked out, and you're not on it, so you're okay.” I checked with a
                    couple of other people, and they said, “You're okay.” I said, “Look, I know what
                    my tic date is, and if I'm not on that list, I'm out, and if I'm out I ought to
                    know about it.” So I called CDA and talked with my counselor, and she had the
                    same list and said, “You're not in, so you're okay. No problem.” I said, “That's
                    not good enough.” So I checked with PER/PE and said, “Look, this is the
                    situation. There's something terribly wrong here. They said, “We'll look into
                    it.” They called back an hour later and said, “Oh! You're out.” And that was the
                    end of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're out meaning...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>RICKERT: ...ticked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you'll be getting a letter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Yes. When the list had been prepared, my name had not been on it. Not
                    being promoted waI won't say delighted mbut it was not nearly as painful as the
                    treatment by the system of not having the decency to do what is always done for
                    people who tic out. Just a bureaucratic error and it's you're problem. Get over
                    it. And that was essentially what the system said. I think that people deserve
                    better than that.</p>
                <p>I stayed on for my last year in NCE and did the best I could and then left in
                    early July of '98. I wanted to make a quiet exit and did make a quiet exit, but
                    we had a little party in the office. One of the desk officers who was working
                    for me had worked for Talbott at an earlier time, and said apparently, “Look.
                    This isn't right that a guy has worked 35 years for the U. S. government should
                    slink out the back door,. We have to do a little more than that.” So he got hold
                    of somebody on Tom Pickering's staff. Pickering came down to the little party we
                    were having at the office. Somebody had given him some very nice talking points
                    which he delivered. I've met him but didn't know him, but in a very professional
                    and thoughtful and decent way as you would expect from Tom Pickering. It was a
                    nice little note at the end of my 35-plus years of government service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And seven years later, you're still working at the

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: Not quite seven. After leaving there, I went into the job search
                    program, and then started in October 13, 1998 in EUR. What was it called? EEA it
                    was called. It was the seed office covering support for the European democracy
                    funds. Now its called the EUR/ACE as a WAE (when actually employed) and after
                    that time ended, they decided they wanted to keep me on, and have done so on a
                    contract basis ever since. So, I'm still around.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>RICKERT: I think I've given them.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I think that I have been very fortunate to have continued employment since then
                    in a field that is relevant to my experience. I have to say I've been better
                    treated as a contractor than I was at times an FSO, but that's another matter.
                    It's a privilege and honor to work with the U. S. government now over 40 years.
                    The experience and knowledge that I've gained over that time, most of it or much
                    of it in Central and Eastern Europe is still being put to use for which I'm
                    grateful. I have very few regrets from my career as a whole. Most of them are
                    things I can see. I could have done better or more wisely. Occasionally I think
                    the department could have done better by me, but I have no real regrets,
                    certainly no grudges, and nothing but a feeling of great respect and
                    appreciation that I was able to work as long as I could doing the things that I
                    did.</p>
