                <p>Interviewed by: Ann Miller Morin </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 23, 1985</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you tell me a little about your father, Ambassador
                        Chambers? He was the Governor of Ohio, you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, he was Governor of Ohio, three times. Before that he served in
                    Congress, and before our next meeting, I'll bring his autobiography because that
                    has dates. He was born on a farm in Jacksonsburg, Ohio. He was a child of his
                    parents' middle age. He was the youngest of seven and his brothers and sisters
                    were all quite a few years older than he. He really had no formal education at
                    all. He went to the one-room schoolhouse in Jacksonsburg, and his first job, at
                    the age of fourteen, was the janitor of the school. And my aunt, after whom I'm
                    named, Anne Cox Baker, was married to John Baker who owned the newspaper in
                    Middletown, Ohio, which was very near Jacksonsburg, and that is how my father
                    got into the newspaper business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He also ran for president in 1920?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With FDR as his vice president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: He ran on President Wilson's hope of the US joining the League of
                    Nations. That was the platform because my father believed that if the US was not
                    a member the League could not survive, which, of course, is what happened. And
                    he received letters all the rest of his life, saying if he had been elected,
                    perhaps there wouldn't have been a second world war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother? Was she an Ohioan also?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, she was born in Pittsburgh, but grew up in Chicago. She was twenty
                    years younger than my father and she was my father's second wife. We were his
                    second family. She always said that even when they were first married he had so
                    much energy, she couldn't keep up. And people are constantly saying to me: “You
                    have so much energy. How do you explain it?” I really think it's genes. Now
                    people say, “How do you move around as much as you do?” It's motivation. I
                    really want to dance every dance. I also attribute yoga. I really do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the meditation part of it also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother the typical homemaker of that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She did not have an outside career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, not at all. Her life really was centered on my father completely.
                    She had outside interests, certainly. She worked purely as a volunteer and
                    purely when these activities could be worked in. She insisted on always being at
                    home when my father arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many siblings did you have, did you grow up with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I have one sister three years younger, and a half brother who was
                    eighteen years older.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, is that so? So you couldn't have had too much to do
                        —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, because he was away at school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your childhood, growing up? What sort of a
                        little girl were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Painfully shy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Painfully shy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Painfully shy. Awkward. I was the ugly duckling, really. My sister was
                    totally the opposite. Very outgoing, very sure of herself; a show-off. Very well
                    coordinated, marvelous at athletics. I was hopeless. She was small for her size,
                    and I was this same height when I was twelve years old, so I towered over the
                    boys in dancing school, and that made me feel even more awkward. I've always
                    said that the reason that I have bad posture is, I tried to hide behind my
                    mother. She was a little shorter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given this rivalry which existed probably from the time
                        your sister was aware of you, did you play together much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I don't know if you would call it “playing.” It seemed to me we fought
                    a lot. She was a tomboy and I remember in those days there were dolls with China
                    heads and someone brought us each one, and I remember they were beautifully
                    dressed as a baby doll. I really loved my doll. Well, my sister broke hers the
                    first day, dropped it and broke it, and somehow, later on, she got mine and
                    broke it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same thing happened to me. My mother made her give me
                        hers, because my older sister broke mine, too. So you were rather a quiet
                        little girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, really painfully shy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've certainly overcome it. Did you like to read a
                        lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stay in a corner and do imaginary things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I did. As a matter of fact, that's strange your mentioning that. I had
                    an imaginary family. My best friend was named “Evelyn Pitts”. That really sounds
                    goofy, but my sister said for years I fooled her. I would come in and say, “Oh,
                    come on, you have to get dressed. We're going to the Pitts' house for lunch.”
                    She said she fell for it for quite a while. When she told her children later on,
                    this bizarre story, they thought it was so funny they named animals after my
                    imaginary story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, you had a very powerful imagination. Did you
                        admire your father tremendously?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I was scared of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Authoritarian, was he? Pretty strict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: He was almost 50 when I was born and he was an imposing figure. A great
                    friend of mine who was married to an in-law said not long ago, “It must have
                    been difficult not to have had sort of a normal father.” He was loving, but he
                    was awfully busy. He enjoyed his grandchildren very much and did spend far more
                    time with them than with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd given up some of his activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your parents live to be a good old age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: My father died when he was 87. When he went to get life insurance, they
                    ask, you know, what age were your parents, grandparents, brothers. They said
                    they had never had such a total of years. My mother used to say, “ I'm glad I'm
                    not a Cox; you all live too damned long.” And my aunt Anne, when she was 92,
                    called my father one day and said: “I just want to say goodbye. I'm going to
                    California tomorrow.” And he said, “Oh, that's wonderful. Why are you going?”
                    She said, “Well, you know, I just always wanted to see that part of the country
                    and I don't have anything really pressing the next couple of weeks.” He said,
                    “Well, that's fine. Who's going with you?” “With me? I don't want to be
                    bothered.” And she went on the train. She died when she was 94. My mother died
                    when she was 70, but she died in an accident. She died in a fire at her
                    house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: So, who knows how long . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your folks churchgoing people? Did they send you to
                        Sunday school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, we went to Sunday school. I would say that Mother was a religious,
                    spiritual person, but Daddy said most of the sermons he heard were made by
                    damned fools. He just couldn't tolerate it. But we did go to Sunday school. We
                    went to a small church in a suburb of Dayton. The man who was the minister was a
                    very profound influence on my life. His name was Herman Page. These would have
                    been years, eight to eleven or twelve. I looked forward to his sermons. I can't
                    remember what he said, but he made an impression on me, and I had one Sunday
                    school teacher who was also a friend of mother, and I really loved her. I just
                    remember her as a very caring, spiritual person.</p>
                <p>We also had a woman, well, you call her a nanny now—she came when I was three
                    weeks old and stayed until I was fourteen. She was from a German background, a
                    very devout Catholic, that sort of peasant-type Catholic. She, unfortunately,
                    instilled in me an awful kind of conscience. Really, it has taken almost my
                    whole life. Guilt feelings, and I remember two types of sins: there was mortal
                    sin and venial. It's taken me a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Page, who was your minister, was he the sort of figure
                        your father was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you were looking toward a man's influence in
                        your life, since your Dad was always so busy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I've never thought of that. No, I would say he was a much more humble
                    man. He went on to become a bishop. We went to his Episcopal Church and I
                    certainly became firmly an Episcopalian. I was confirmed in that church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this was one of the reasons why you have been
                        so interested in philanthropy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Possibly. I believe that family background influence is important. My
                    parents were both very caring people. Mother, during the depression, and I was
                    pretty young then, she was giving milk and I used to go with her. I used to go
                    with Mother every morning, and people would come with pails, and we would ladle
                    out milk.</p>
                <p>My father was — I guess he had very much a reporter's mind. He was interested in
                    every person he met. He hated to come to New York, and whenever he did have to,
                    he stayed at the Waldorf Towers. He came in one day, and the maid was bustling
                    around. He used to call: “Well, hello, girly; what's your name?” He would find
                    out how many children, and he found out one of his employees' child had terrible
                    teeth and he said, “You've got to get those straightened.” “Oh, its too
                    expensive.” So Daddy did that.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Well, anyway, the story I started to tell you about the Waldorf Towers—he'd chat
                    with her every day, and she said, “Oh, Governor, what a change in this apartment
                    from last week.” And, of course, he was very curious as to who was there. She
                    said, “Ambassador Kennedy was here, and it was full of whores and bicarbonate of
                    soda.” He loved that story.</p>
                <p>Oh, countless young people he helped through college. In fact, Scotty Reston was
                    the son of the greenskeeper at the Moraine golf club. I remember old Mr. Reston;
                    he was a wonderful old Scot, and Scotty was Daddy's caddy when he was a little
                    boy. He came to have lunch with me when I first arrived in Brussels, and he
                    said, “You know, I was in my senior year of college when the Depression came.
                    There was just no way I could continue. This was a terrible tragedy for me.” He
                    said, “Your father loaned me $500 and that enabled me to finish. That's sounds
                    like such a small sum, but,” he said, “believe me, there was no other way.” His
                    first job was with Daddy's newspaper in the Dayton Daily News. He said, “You
                    know, your father never forgave me for leaving the Dayton News for the New York
                    Times.” My son was there that day and I was so pleased for him to be there. He
                    asked Jim if he was a golfer, and Jim said, “Not yet,” and he said, “Your
                    grandfather cheated. He used to give himself putts that long.”</p>

                    very soon of pneumonia. I was born just before the campaign of 1920. The
                    pictures of mother and me! She was really very fat, and I was, too. She said she
                    was so afraid of losing a child the second time that she wanted to nurse me. She
                    was told she should drink a lot of hot chocolate, and so she did get very fat
                    immediately.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: The little boy died of pneumonia when he was less than a week old,
                    something that happens so often.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother very protective of her children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I guess so and I always felt that my sister was the favorite child.
                    I've said it to Barbie, and she has said, “Oh, heavens, no, because mother
                    worried so about you. She thought you needed bringing out.” “Well,” I said,
                    “that isn't complimentary at all; it's almost making me sound like a retarded
                    child.” I did not consider it a compliment that she didn't need any.</p>
                <p>My sister said she worried about what would happen to me if mother died. I did
                    feel a loss for a while, but I really feel that I did not bloom, or whatever you
                    call it, until after my mother died. And I was afraid that this would be the
                    case with my older daughter, my oldest child, but an illness that she has, I
                    feel, has changed that.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: No; I was just shy and awkward as I say. I always had good friends. I
                    never was a leader, or outgoing, but all of my life I've had, wherever I've
                    been, a few really good friends. I was not a friendless child in spite of the
                    shyness.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what do you attribute this shyness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I don't know. I really don't. I don't know if the birth of my sister—at
                    times we can be quite compatible; other times totally not. She said once, “It
                    must have been very difficult for you to have me as a sister.” And it was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I think it was just fighting. It was just two sisters fighting. I went
                    away to school when I was twelve, so there weren't too many years at home,
                    really.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No; there was never any comparison. The only thing, I was a good
                    student and I really liked to study, and that pleased my father. But he really
                    took it for granted. I was on the honor roll, but if my sister even passed one
                    grade, that was a celebration. Mother used to say that he was proud of her
                    athletic ability and proud of my scholastic ability. I remember, though, him
                    telling me once, when I was a little girl in grammar school, that if we ever
                    failed a grade it would be a disgrace. And that frightened me so that I really
                    worked. It didn't bother my sister at all. And we're the same zodiac sign.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is your rising sign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Scorpio.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: There was only the public school in Dayton and Mother didn't feel that
                    was adequate. So my father, in the early '20s, bought the newspaper in Miami.
                    Carl Fisher, who developed Miami Beach, persuaded him to come down just to see
                    it, and he fell in love with it and felt he wanted to build a house there. But
                    he could never be anywhere without working, so he bought a very small newspaper.
                    So we spent winters there.</p>
                <p>We would begin school in Dayton and then go down for the winter and then finish
                    the year. I do remember Mother saying I didn't have any trouble with that at
                    all, but my sister did. Anyway, she felt when I was twelve I should be the whole
                    year in one school, so I boarded at a school in Miami until my parents came
                    down, and then I would live at home while they were there, and then I would go
                    back. I did that for two years, and then, when I was fourteen, I went to Holton
                    Arms School in Washington for one year. That was because, from the moment that I
                    was born, it was assumed that I was going to the school that my mother had gone
                    to: Miss Porter's. My granddaughter is the fifth generation of my mother's
                    family [to go there]. As I say, it was just assumed. There really was no
                    argument about whether we wanted to. We were never asked. I remember one summer
                    when there seemed to be something going on in the house and the next morning we
                    were told we were going to camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your parents give you anything to strive for? That is,
                        did they say, “When Anne grows up she's going to be a . . .”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. One of my roommates in boarding school and I were discussing that.
                    There were three of us who roomed together and we all had two daughters almost
                    the same age. We were talking about the differences, and Amanda said, “Nobody
                    ever told us to be somebody, so we weren't.” Miss Porter's school was then a
                    finishing school. It was not even college preparatory. I think I wish I had gone
                    to college. We weren't even thinking of that. I certainly had nothing in mind,
                    and I was married when I was twenty. Most of us were when we were pretty
                    young.</p>
                <p>I always liked to write and I remember dreaming this—all the kids do—that I would
                    like to write books and win a Pulitzer prize.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you write at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, I really don't. I write letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't written the story of your days as

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. I think too many people have written books; I really do. They are
                    endless, as we know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your background in school was entirely in the
                        humanities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; certainly English, literature, history. One of the questions I see
                    here is, was there an influential teacher? Definitely. My first year at Miss
                    Porter's, I started studying history of art. Miss McLennan was the toughest
                    teacher I had. We were scared to death of her. We used to call her “the Sphinx.”
                    She absolutely started my interest in art. My mother had beautiful taste, but
                    there were no sort of works of art in our house. Strangely enough, after I left
                    Brussels, I was talking to Perry Stieglitz one day, and somehow he mentioned
                    that my old long-ago teacher, Miss McLennan, moved to Washington and was a great
                    friend of Perry and Moune. I was just amazed, and he said, “Would you like to
                    see her again?” I said, “I certainly would. I'd like to thank her for what she's
                    meant to my life.” So the next time I was in Washington, Perry arranged that we
                    have dinner. She had been living with another retired teacher for years and
                    years. We went to a Chinese restaurant and I said “I want to thank you for what
                    you've given me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I bet she was thrilled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: She said, “You know, to hear that every now and then makes all the
                    years of teaching worthwhile.” She said she remembered my voice. I think the
                    reason she had any memory was that she had gone to Denison University in Ohio
                    and my father received an honorary degree [from there]. I really think it was
                    because of him. She died last year at age eighty. But the interesting thing: I
                    remembered her as being very tall and big. Well, she seemed to have shrunk. That
                    evening I kept saying, “Miss McLennan,” and she said, “Oh, Anne, please call me
                    Sally.” I said, “I just couldn't; I really couldn't,” She was still “Miss
                    McLennan.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were interested in history as well as art
                        history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes, English and history, very much so. Of course, Farmington in
                    those days being a finishing school, we didn't have to take math. I have had
                    arithmetic. That was always a blank spot.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Oh, several years before I went to Belgium, I had a call from a great friend of
                    mine, who was also my lawyer and he said he and two other people wanted to come
                    and see me. There was a big fund-raising going on for the school that my son was
                    attending. One of the men was president of a bank, and I thought they wanted to
                    come and talk about Jim's school, so I couldn't turn them down; they were all
                    friends. I was just learning how to shoot, I came in with my gun over my
                    shoulder. When I walked in my living room, there they were. My great friend
                    said, “Oh, Anne, you can put that away. We're not here to ask you for money.” I
                    thought what on earth then? They were asking me to become a director of the
                    bank. I was the first woman in Atlanta. And I said to the president, “Oh,
                    Gordon, I really don't think I can do that. The only subject I ever failed in
                    school was math.” He said, “Don't worry about that; the computers do it all
                    now.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't miss it?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, yes, jacks; I remember playing jacks in Miami, and marbles. Then
                    I did become proficient later on—I remember having tennis lessons. My sister
                    used to laugh and say I would get “my two big feet,”set and if the ball happened
                    to come, I would knock it back, but, otherwise, I didn't.</p>
                <p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: I remember being a Scout, but again, we would leave Dayton and go to
                    Florida, so I wouldn't say scouting had any impact.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Well, in those days people used to joke and say the baby girls

                <p>CHAMBERS: Scared to death of horses. My mother tells the story that when I was
                    really little, two or three, I fell off a pony, that I was very angry and I went
                    and got the stirrup and tried to get back on. I don't know what caused that, but
                    I was a very fearful child. I've always been frightened of heights. During the
                    '20s, my father was combating Al Capone's influence at Miami Beach, and we'd
                    have a watchman at the house. We didn't know this until much later. The Feds
                    could never convict Capone because he never murdered anybody; he never did any
                    of these things. Daddy tells the story that one day he was playing golf and
                    there was machine gun fire; one gang against the other in sand traps. It was a
                    terrible, terrible community, and no one knew how to get rid of this menace.
                    They came and talked to Daddy, and he said, “Why don't you check on his income
                    tax. Maybe you can get him on tax evasion.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father was the one who suggested that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Capone stood up in court when he was convicted and said “I know
                    who did this to me; it's that goddamn Cox and I'm going to get him.” We were
                    never told this, but we were told later. I remember leaving Miami suddenly and
                    we were in a stateroom and, Nanie, our nanny, wouldn't even let us go in the
                    dining room, and we were told there were security people in the car. Now,
                    whether we got those vibes—because even my sister, who really wasn't fearful,
                    she and I were always frightened at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a terrible thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: We were never aware of any discussion, but do children get these
                    vibes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so; don't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, I suppose so. Looking back, I probably overemphasize it, but I
                    really don't look back on my childhood as being terribly happy. In fact, a
                    friend of mine, a couple of years ago, sent me—we all get these pillows with
                    sayings on them—saying, “Screw the golden years.” And I wrote her back and said,
                    “Thank you for thinking of me at Christmas, but I really can't agree with that
                    because I'm finding my golden years my happiest ones.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, parents didn't sit down with children the
                        way we do with ours. Children were “seen and not heard.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That's right. But my mother was certainly a loving person. And when my
                    father died, Mother said, “One thing he never was able to express to you
                    children was how he cared about you.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No cuddling at all. When my son was a little boy, I remember he was
                    maybe four or five, and he came in the room and I said, “Come on, James, give me
                    a big kiss.” And my sister whose son is ten years older than mine said, “Now
                    you've got to stop that.” I said, “Why?” And she said, “He's not going to like
                    that much longer. Jimmy absolutely made me stop kissing him.” But my son never
                    did. Not in front of his friends, but always very, very loving, and one of my
                    happiest memories is, he had gone away to college and he told me he was driving
                    home. He had called the night before to say where he was in Virginia and he was
                    arriving on a Sunday and it was the Sunday before Christmas. I wanted to hear
                    another clergyman who had a great impact on my life and was then our minister in
                    Atlanta. I thought I could go to Tom's Christmas service and be back at home
                    waiting for Jim before he got there, but Jim beat us and I saw his car. So I
                    opened the door and I called to him, and I remember him coming down the stairs.
                    He was then 18, I guess, and he absolutely enveloped me. He said, “I've been
                    thinking of coming home for six weeks.” I was in tears. He's a very warm,
                    sensitive and demonstrative person. But, no, my parents were not.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: I remember acutely suffering from homesickness. I went to camp, as I
                    said, and I remember the pangs of homesickness, lying in the tent and hearing
                    the bugles, and yet I really liked camp. My tent mate and I were good friends
                    and I was a very good swimmer. I think that's because we grew up in Miami and we
                    had our swimming teacher, who also trained Olympic stars. I remembered I won the
                    Fourth of July races at the Polo Club. I would usually win the swimming cup, but
                    I was no good at going through the barrels or jumping over them. My sister won
                    all those. The last night at camp was awards night and my tent-mate won the best
                    camper award. I was absolutely thrilled. I won the swimming cup, which was the
                    biggest cup in camp. I was so proud. I had an upper berth coming back and I
                    slept with the cup in my upper berth. The next summer, my sister was going to
                    the same camp and she looked at the cup and said, “ I'll win that and I'll also
                    win the tennis cup and I'll also win the riding cup.” Well, she came back
                    cupless. When I asked about it, she said they gave the tennis cup to somebody
                    whose family had given a lot of money.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Again, we didn't have to do athletics. There was a list of major sports

                <p>CHAMBERS: I remember going to a wedding with my father when I was fourteen, and
                    there was the grande dame of Dayton. She turned to my father and said, “Well,
                    Jim, one of these days someone is going to come along and say: I want to marry
                    your daughter.” And I thought, “Good heavens.” I couldn't imagine such a

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, I didn't, because we lived in Dayton, Ohio. The year before there
                    had been two debutantes, but my year I would have been the only one. One of my
                    roommates in boarding school made her debut in New York, and she suggested that
                    I might want to do that. Well, I think I was too shy, and I felt it really
                    wasn't appropriate. I didn't live in New York.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: No, the winter after I finished at Miss Porter's, I went with two other
                    girls to spend some months living with a family in Paris. That was very much a
                    thing to do, particularly, [for] girls who had gone to schools which were not
                    college preparatory. It was a custom in those days, and it was wonderful. That
                    was the beginning of my love for France.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: House. We spoke only French at meals and we had a tutor. We'd have
                    French lessons and then we go around to the Louvre, the museums, all around the
                    country. We'd go to Chartres and study. All of this in French. It was a
                    wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was certainly wonderful preparation, too. This would

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That would have been '37, '38, I guess, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, did you get any feeling that the war was

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I don't think then. I think that next year, and again, I forget — a
                    friend from school was going to a school in Italy, in Florence, and I had
                    decided to go. Then for a couple of years before the war actually started, there
                    were war scares and Mussolini was rattling sabers, and so my father cancelled me
                    out. I really was sorry because my friends went on and had a wonderful time and
                    I think I would have loved that. I guess that is when I went to Finch
                    instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the Finch in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, but it's no longer there. When I went to it, it was a junior
                    college. When my older daughter went it was a four-year college, and she
                    graduated. But as with many small colleges, there was no endowment. They just
                    couldn't make it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, again, you studied liberal arts, especially art and
                        history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I really wasn't very serious as far as studying, and my friends were
                    making their debuts. I wasn't a serious college student, so I decided not to go
                    back to Finch. The following year, that would have been 1939, I went to
                    something called the Residence School run by an Irish lady named Mollie Hourigan
                    and we lived in a brownstone. The only class that we actually did there was
                    learning about operas and maybe piano, and then we all went out to other
                    schools. I went to a cooking school, and then I guess we had French with Miss
                    Hourigan. I really liked that. I went there in the fall and the early part of
                    December my father bought the evening newspaper in Atlanta; the Atlanta Journal.
                    It just so happened that the whole deal jelled just at the time of the world
                    premiere of Gone With the Wind. So Mother and Daddy went down for that, and
                    Mother called me at school and said, “Get on the train and come on. This is
                    going to be the greatest spectacle that has ever been.” I said, “Oh, Christmas
                    vacation doesn't start until next week.” She said, “I don't care; whatever
                    you're learning there, this is much more exciting.” So I did go down on the
                    train and when I got there our hostess, with whom we were staying, said, “A
                    friend of mine, Katharine Johnson, is having a luncheon for your parents.”
                    Katharine Johnson became my mother-in-law six months later. I met my first
                    husband there at the luncheon, so it was a very quick courtship. He was studying
                    in New Haven at the [Yale] graduate school. I went back to the school after New
                    Year's but then we were engaged by February, so I just gave up the school and
                    came home and that was the end of my education.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: I did the provisional course of the Junior League, and my mother-in-law
                    got me in her garden club. That was supposed to be something very big.</p>
                <p>You asked if I had any feeling about the war. Looking back to the year when I was
                    fourteen, when I was in school in Washington, at Holton Arms, I remember telling
                    my roommate about current events and things that I had read: Hitler, Mussolini.
                    She was smart; she wasn't a dumb-bell at all, and she said, “I just can't
                    believe you know all these things.” I said, “There are frightening things
                    happening.”</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; that's right. Well, let's see; we were married in June and the
                    next December was Pearl Harbor. Even before that, I guess, I volunteered at the
                    British War Relief. So I did start that. That had been established even before
                    Pearl Harbor. Then we went in the Navy soon after that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I moved up here and lived at the River House, so we were here for
                    several months before my husband went overseas and I went back home with my
                    parents. My sister was married the following June. She came back home and her
                    husband was killed a few months later. That was terrible. Just after the war
                    started, I had my first child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was your daughter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. To go back to the garden club, I said later, laughingly, the only
                    thing I've ever done that made my father really proud was when I was elected
                    president of the Peach Tree Garden Club. I told Daddy, and he was going to have
                    lunch with Mr. Woodruff, who was “Mr. Coca Cola” in Atlanta. And he said, “I
                    told Bob Woodruff you're the only Yankee, ever, to become president of the
                    club.” That really pleased him very much.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Then I remember someone I met at the beginning of my stay in Atlanta. He was
                    quite pompous, but I remember he said to me, “You're never going to make it in
                    Atlanta.” And I said, “Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why?” He said, “You're not
                    pushy enough. You have to be really pushy.” So this same man, not too many years
                    ago, was complimenting me on what I had done, and I couldn't resist because I
                    have never forgotten that. I was so shy, having a rough time there anyway. I
                    said, “Oh, I guess this means you've changed your opinion?” And I reminded him
                    of that. He just bristled. He said, “I never said that.” I said, “Jack, that's
                    the sort of thing one doesn't forget.” Anyway, that was how I started out in
                    Atlanta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the war came; the war went. When did you get
                        interested in the various businesses? Or did that not happen until after
                        your father died?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I think I mentioned we were the second family, and apparently in his
                    first marriage, his wife had told something about the business, something that
                    shouldn't have been said, and he felt very strongly that women should not be
                    involved in any way in the business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So even had you wanted to, you couldn't have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh no, not at all. I do remember, though, right after the war; I don't
                    know what sort of rearrangement he was doing, but he did put me on the board of
                    directors. That didn't mean that I had anything to say, but it was some sort of
                    acknowledgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your life was actually centered in Atlanta and the
                        group of friends you made. And you were the typical, conventional woman who
                        knew her place, as we all did, didn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, and I did. I was active in the junior league, and when I think
                    back I think that was another person; it couldn't have been me. As I said I
                    became president of the garden club. So it was a very typical life. By that
                    time, I had two daughters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel complete? Were you enjoying your life, or did
                        you feel there was something you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No; I didn't. My marriage was not very happy. Their father really never
                    paid any attention to the children, so we didn't do things as a family. Even
                    without a good marriage, I thought a woman's happiest years were being with her
                    young children. No, I never thought of going beyond.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're what is known as a late bloomer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, very, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the fact that you have done so much since has
                        anything to do with the women's movement and the so-called liberation of
                        women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I've been interested in it; certainly. I worked very hard for the
                    passage of the ERA in Georgia, and it was just hopeless. Those rural legislators
                    said that if they went home, having voted for it, they would never be
                    reelected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it's the women who wouldn't let them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what's so strange.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I think mainly I became liberated and less inhibited. I just became a
                    different person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that would have happened in any case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: During the years that I was being the typical young matron, I did start
                    playing golf and I really loved that. I was never a good athlete. I had to
                    really work very hard, but I really, really did, and that was one of my great
                    pleasures. I played a lot. We went to northern Michigan in the summers and I
                    played there. Then our company bought a plantation in South Carolina for the
                    pulp wood—we have a newsprint plant—so we started going there. By this time, I
                    was married for the second time and my husband loved to shoot and there was
                    wonderful quail shooting. I realized that all the women shot.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>One Christmas I looked under the Christmas tree and I saw a long, narrow box, and
                    I knew what was in it and I didn't want to open it; I waited until the end. It
                    was some new kind of gun that didn't kick, and my husband said, “It's the only
                    one in Atlanta.” He was very proud of it and I said, “Oh, what a shame to waste
                    it on me.” Then my nephew moved to Atlanta and we were very simpatico. He stayed
                    with us for a while. He rented a house in the country because he had three dogs
                    and he came in very excited—I had the gun by this time—and said, “My landlord,
                    Mr. Palmer, gives shooting lessons. Now's your chance, Aunt Anne.” So I started
                    shooting. I was fifty years old and I asked him if I was his oldest beginning
                    pupil. He said, no, he had a woman in Texas who started when she was fifty-five.
                    I said I really had never held a gun. He said, “Good. In the first place women
                    are easier to teach, and I'd rather have someone who hasn't learned a lot of
                    mistakes.” He said, “Men, even if they're beginners, think they know a lot more
                    about it.” That became a wonderful association. The Palmers actually lived in
                    Greensboro, but they had a country place here and by that time I had gotten fed
                    up with golf. I frankly was sick of women's foursomes. By the time the shooting
                    came along, I really had had enough of golf. Well, I got really into the
                    shooting and I really got good. I had the most wonderful teacher and it was such
                    fun, so I said there's not enough time to play golf and shooting. I like the
                    shooting better. I feel a lot better at it, plus we were going to our place in
                    South Carolina. It became a great part of my life. It was less trivial than it
                    sounds. I really did become a good shot, and I was terribly proud of myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, if you turn out to be very good in one thing, it
                        spills over in your feelings about everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Fred Palmer was my teacher. He and his wife and one or two other
                    couples would come often to South Carolina. Then we started going to Scotland,
                    grouse shooting. Well, as we all know, our friends differ as we change interest.
                    We see the people, obviously, the people in our group. Fred died, and afterward
                    I said to someone who had known him and loved him as I did, “You know, he gave
                    me almost the first self-confidence I ever had and it wasn't just in teaching me
                    to shoot.” And Sandy said—this was a very wise man—he said, “I'm so glad you
                    realize that because I saw that a long time ago.”</p>
                <p>Fred had the most marvelous sense of humor. One other friend of mine, Philip
                    Alston and I were the only people any of our friends knew who had supported
                    Jimmy Carter through the years. And Fred said, when I told him I was going to
                    become an ambassador, “Do you realize that all of your friends thought you and
                    Philip were crazy?” I said, “Sure, but this has been my political history all
                    through my life.” And he laughed about it. Anyway, my father and Fred Palmer, I
                    feel, were great influences, and the third person was Jimmy Carter, because by
                    appointing me to that job, my life became really changed. And I was surprised,
                    honestly. I naively thought when I finished my time in Belgium that I would go
                    back to Atlanta and my life would take up in the same way. It hasn't at all. I
                    give great, great credit to the fact that I became more exposed, for one
                    thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The summer after I went home I was asked to become the first woman director of
                    the Coca Cola Company. I don't think that ever would have happened if I had
                    stayed in Atlanta. There have been so many things like that. That's why I have
                    an apartment in New York now. I never, never would have dreamed of such a thing
                    if I had just stayed on in Atlanta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about how you got to know the Carters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, since I first could vote, well, every presidential election, I
                    would go down and volunteer and do whatever. I was keenly interested in every
                    Democratic election, and in 1966 many of us were very concerned about the
                    possibility of Lester Maddox becoming Governor of Georgia. Most of my friends in
                    Atlanta are Republicans, but they always have been everywhere. Someone said to
                    me, “Did it ever occur to you, you might be wrong?” I said, “Heavens, no.” And
                    someone asked my father once if he'd ever consider voting for a Republican and
                    he said, “Certainly, if I ever found one worth voting for.” So I said to my
                    friend Philip Alston, “Is there anyone on the scene rising in this State to
                    combat this terrible tragedy?” And he said, “There is a young man in the State
                    legislature, a State senator. I'd like you to meet him. His name is Jimmy
                    Carter. I think you'll be impressed with him.” I think I met him at Griffin
                    Bell's house. And I was impressed. So right then I started working. That year he
                    was defeated by Lester Maddox. I remember after the election, Charlie Kirbo
                    said, “If we had had $20,000 we would have won.” I didn't have the kind of
                    income then that I do now, but still I said, “Charlie, why didn't you call me?
                    Don't ever let that happen again.”</p>
                <p>After his father's defeat in 1980, I was at a luncheon with Chip Carter. It was
                    kind of the first old group. Chip said, “I'll never forget the time that Daddy
                    came home with a check from Anne Chambers. It was the biggest check anybody had
                    ever seen.” Well, that's how it started. He was defeated then, and we had Lester
                    Maddox. But then we all started working again, and he was, as you know, elected
                    governor.</p>
                <p>My house is right across from the [governor's] mansion. When they moved in, he
                    said, “There were funds either for a tennis court or a swimming pool.” And they
                    couldn't decide, because the family liked both things, and I said, “Why don't
                    you build a tennis court, because I have a pool.” And that's what happened. So
                    my family, who played tennis went over there and, oh, it was quite an unusual
                    scene: the policemen were stopping traffic and the governor would come across
                    with Amy on his shoulders in their bathing suits. When they came, I rarely went
                    down; I just left them by themselves. In an interview after they had left the
                    governor's mansion, Rosalynn said that she felt like such a country bumpkin and
                    she felt she didn't know how to dress, and I felt so sad. I thought if she'd
                    ever told me that I would have gone—they're both very reserved. We didn't just
                    bounce back and forth. They're very hard-working. Anyway, it was a nice
                    arrangement.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>After they moved out and a new governor had moved in, one day my brother-in-law
                    and nephew came bounding down the stairs with their tennis rackets, and I said,
                    “Where are you going?” My brother-in-law said, “We're going across.” I said,
                    “The guard has changed. We no longer have an invitation. You've got to find
                    another tennis court.” People always speak of that and my relationship and the
                    fact of the Governor bringing Amy on his shoulders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though you didn't see much of them, you were
                        friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes; definitely. I remember—Amy, you see, was about four—and one
                    Halloween Rosalynn called and said, obviously she was too young to go trick or
                    treating, but she had a witch's costume, and what time was I going to be home?
                    They thought if she did one or two houses that would—so we made a big fuss of
                    having them come over. The photographer came and took her picture. But that's
                    how I started with Jimmy Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever actually campaign for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did do all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, my, yes. I remember in the '76 campaign, I was married, and my
                    husband and I were up in New York with another couple and it was toward the end
                    of the campaign. I didn't really make speeches. I worked very hard while I was
                    raising money, and I made two very good friends. I had known Betty Talmadge very
                    casually, but we worked together, and Robin Duke, who lives here in New York and
                    whose husband has been ambassador. We talked every night on the phone and I
                    said, “This creates a bond that really lasts forever.” To me there was nothing
                    more exciting than being that involved in a political campaign—the
                    adrenalin!</p>
                <p>My father died when Jim was three months old, but he has great pride in his
                    grandfather. In fact, when he was home last weekend, he was up in the attic
                    looking for things. Someone had sent me for a present the framed front page of
                    the New York Times saying, “Cox Nominated” and a picture of me. I'm sending some
                    things up to Jim and he asked me to send that. People often ask me and ask him
                    if he ever might go into politics. I think he might. Someone said, “Oh, wouldn't
                    that be terrible.” I said, “No; we need young people.” He's intensely
                    interested. The first year that he could vote he was a freshman in college. He
                    decided he wanted to come home to vote, not by absentee ballot. If you remember,
                    the weekend before Tuesday it was really touch and go, and he called me up
                    Sunday and said, “What are the plans on Tuesday? I said, “We planned a big
                    victory celebration, but I can't guarantee; I don't know what to tell you.” He
                    said, “I don't care, either way I want to be in Atlanta on Tuesday night.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be part of it; a part of the history. It must be a very
                        exciting thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: So he came down, got there in time to vote and then had to take the
                    early bird back. We had the original little group of Carter supporters; I think
                    it was seven couples. The big campaign party for the evening was at the Omni,
                    which is next to the Omni Hotel, so we decided to get a little private room and
                    have television and just have buffet and drinks. I organized it. My nephew
                    called to ask if I wanted to come down to the newspaper that evening. I said,
                    “Oh, no, I've got a room; it's the original Carter supporters.” And Jimmy
                    laughed and said, “Well, it doesn't have to be a very big room.” Which was
                    true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the seven couples include the Carters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: They came in, but they didn't stay during the counting. Anyway, Jim
                    wasn't ready, so he said he'd come down later. The Secret Service arrived before
                    the Carters did, and they asked me could I vouch for everyone in this room. I
                    said, “Yes, I can.” I added, “There may be a young kid, with kind of long hair
                    coming to the door in a little while, saying he's my son, and I am expecting
                    him.” A little while later they came and said, “Sorry to bother you again.” They
                    opened the door and here's Jim with his long hair. “Tell them it's me. Tell them
                    it's me. They won't let me in. Nobody will let me in. Bobby Lipschitz too, and
                    his father's inside. Tell them to let him in.”</p>
                <p>Bert Lance brought Jimmy Roosevelt that night. The summer before at the
                    Democratic convention my husband had seen in a funny little old shop, a
                    Cox/Roosevelt button, so Jim that night had Carter/Mondale on one side and
                    Cox/Roosevelt on the other. Jimmy Roosevelt came up and said, “Hey, kid, how do
                    you happen to have that button with my father's name on it?” And Jim said,
                    “Because my grandfather's name is on top of your father's name.” Bert Lance
                    heard this and said, “Oh, I've got to get a picture of this,” so he brought the
                    photographer over and took a picture of the two Jimmys, Roosevelt and Chambers.
                    So that was rather amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Carter won, were you surprised that he made it
                        nationally?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, again, the story that I tell, the summer before they were leaving
                    the Governor's mansion, Rosalynn called one Saturday afternoon and asked if I
                    was going to be home for a while. I said, “Sure,” and she said, “Jimmy has
                    something he wants to tell you.” So I was curious. I remember it was hot and I
                    had one of those ceiling fans on the porch, and we sat down. He doesn't do small
                    talk, you know; he came right to the point and said, “I just came to tell you
                    I'm going to run for president.” I really gulped and said, “Well, good luck.” He
                    said, “When I told my mother that, she said, 'President of what?'” That's one of
                    my favorite stories. And I did think, “What is he thinking of?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Jimmy who?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. I realized he was dead serious. As I say, I was very involved in
                    the campaign and worked very hard. The thing about the Playboy article came out
                    and, oh, there were a lot of difficult times. You asked if I campaigned, and I
                    said my husband and I were here with another couple, and Bert Lance called me
                    and said there was going to be a rally in Wall Street. It was the building where
                    George Washington had spoken, and he said they were having Democratic
                    celebrities, Bella Abzug and Lauren Bacall and Robin Duke, who speaks
                    beautifully. He said, “They want someone who is from Georgia who knows the
                    Carters as a friend and neighbor, and will you do it?”</p>
                <p>I was paralyzed. Absolutely. Oh, I thought, “If this means so much—I remember, I
                    had some months before started doing transcendental meditation. So the morning
                    of this rally I was just in a twit. The phone rang and it was the young couple
                    who had been my teachers in TM, and I said, “Oh, I can't talk to you now. I'm in
                    such a twit. I've got to make a speech in Wall Street, I've never done anything
                    like this in my life. I'm just too nervous to talk.” She said, “How long is the
                    drive down to Wall Street?” very calmly. I said, “I don't know; I guess twenty
                    minutes.” She said, “When you get in the car, just close your eyes and meditate,
                    and that will calm you down.” And it really did. So I did do that. I was rather
                    excited about it. That was the first speaking like that that I've ever done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what point in the campaign was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: This was late. This was like a couple of weeks before election. It was
                    when it was getting really crucial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were really thrown into the limelight with a

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But afterward, it must have been a wonderful feeling?(Part
                        of anecdote lost. Mrs. Chambers is discussing election evening, 1976.)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I said to Lillian Carter, Jimmy's mother, “You better get to bed.” She
                    said, “There's no way I could go to bed; I'm too excited. Just come and let's
                    chat.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Miss Lillian was at the hotel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. She said, “I'll see you tomorrow.” I said, “I think I'm going to
                    take a hanky along with me, it may be too big for me.” She said, “I think I'm
                    going to take a big one.” I remember her saying that. When they moved in the
                    Governor's mansion, she came up and was a great help with Amy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine she would be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Because she knew Rosalynn was a very active wife, and I think they felt
                    that Amy just kind of needed somebody in the house. I remember her being there a
                    great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you sit in the special box all through the

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, and how exciting it was!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you during the famous walk down Pennsylvania
                        Avenue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Just walking, and that was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went to all the parties and everything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. That was January. It was early spring, I guess, maybe March,
                    early April, and Bert Lance called the man who was then the president of the
                    Atlanta Newspapers and told him that I was going to be asked to go to Belgium,
                    and to tell me that I would get a call in the next day. So I was prepared when
                    Cy Vance called. He said, “If you don't mind, just keep it under your hat,
                    because we want to make the announcement.” And I said, “Is it all right if I
                    tell my children?” and he said yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So I told my daughters. In those days I stayed at the River Club when I came
                    here. They had cute operators and I know they listened to everything; they were
                    so curious. I was trying to be subtle with Jim. He was in college, as I said. I
                    said, “Jim, I am going to be appointed to a country.” He said, “That's
                    wonderful, which one?” I said, “All right, think of your geography; it's between
                    France and Germany.” “ Oh, it's Luxembourg, naturally, all the women. . .” I
                    said, “No, Jim, it's not.” “It's Holland?” “No.” I said, “Jim, you're being
                    awfully dense. Do you remember when we went on our first barge trip, the
                    country? You're really being dumb.” Then I started quoting that famous poem,
                    “Flanders Field” Well, of course, he was far too young to—Finally I said, “Just
                    go and look at a map.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did your children feel about your becoming an

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, they were terribly excited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they approved? It's quite an honor. Did you ever
                        discuss with Jimmy Carter why he chose you for Belgium particularly?</hi>

                <p>CHAMBERS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wondered what comes into the decisions on these

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Philip Alston, who had been my friend, was named Ambassador to
                    Australia and both he and his wife speak with a southern accent. We have a
                    friend who has very dry wit and someone asked, How were they chosen?” He said,
                    “Well, I think Anne was chosen for Belgium because she speaks French, and the
                    Alstons for Australia because Elkin almost speaks English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a good quote. It's a funny story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: You're asking did I ever discuss why he chose me. Heavens, no. It was
                    all very correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was sure of that, but I just wondered if after the fact
                        . . .</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. Then I started really commuting to Washington and learning for
                    about a month. This was very touching: every friend who I invited to my
                    swearing-in, came. Everyone, except my sister and my brother-in-law. I have two
                    friends who are almost reclusive, and I said, “Oh, the Meads will never come.”
                    They did. I have another friend whose husband was terminally ill with cancer.
                    They came, but didn't stay for the dinner party. My three children had the
                    party. They were the hosts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your swearing-in? Was that up on the eighth

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; it was in the room with the Thomas Jefferson desk. And that was
                    very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who swore you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Warren Christopher. He's a wonderful man. And he had done research
                    about my father, in his remarks. I was very impressed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: My younger daughter is very good on her feet [and she spoke]. My older
                    daughter said, “I will die if I have to get up.” Well, Jim got up, and said, “I
                    guess after my Mom has coped with all of us, for well at least twenty years as
                    far as I am concerned, I think she can handle all the problems; I think she can
                    handle whatever.” I said, “Jim, you've never acknowledged the fact that there
                    were any problems in the last twenty years.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any copy of your remarks that you could give

                <p>CHAMBERS: I have them written. Let me write that down, also that letter with a
                    picture from my granddaughter. She calls me, “Honey.” She said: “Dear Honey, you
                    better be smart; you better be wise; if you're a fake, go jump in the lake.” In
                    my remarks I read this, and I said, “I hope there are no lakes in Belgium.”</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; very much so. I had not been a student in so many years, and I
                    stayed at the Madison and I worked all day. They'd say, “We'll send you back in
                    a car.” It was April; it was such a beautiful time of the year. I said, “Not
                    only is it such a beautiful walk, I really just have to get the cobwebs out of
                    my brain.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. I remember my first appointment was with Jim Lowenstein
                    [Deputy Assistant Secretary for European Affairs], and he was in northern
                    Europe. And I, of course, was so excited and such an amateur and so naive. He
                    was kind of dour. I said, “It's just so wonderful to be going to such a
                    country.” He said, “Well, yes, Belgium is a nice country; just one thing the
                    matter with it.” I said, “What's that?” “The weather.” And I said, “Oh, you mean
                    like London?” “Worse.” So I made up my mind then I wasn't going to let the
                    weather disturb me. The amusing thing about that was, he was appointed
                    Ambassador to Luxembourg, and even he admitted it rains more in Luxembourg than
                    in Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Really. I never drove over there when it wasn't absolutely teeming with
                    rain. That is statistically, so I've teased him ever since about that, his
                    warning me about the weather. I said it served him right.</p>
                <p>Next was, well, history of the country, past and present. I remember, finally,
                    about six o'clock, there was still one big book, and I said, “I'll take this
                    back to the hotel and I'll go to bed early and I'll read it there.” He said,
                    “Oh, no; it's classified.” So I had to sit there and read it. Some of what is
                    considered classified: the King's name, the King's age—it was no more
                    classified. . .You know.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly, I know. They do it with a heavy hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. I even went out to Virginia to the office responsible for
                    decorating embassy residences. I went to the Pentagon. I met with Stansfield
                    Turner [at CIA]. There were seven newly appointed ambassadors. We had a two-day
                    seminar on terrorism. The first day the spouses were included; the second day
                    they were not.</p>
                <p>The first thing we were told was that our government never pays ransom. So I
                    think it was like saying, “Anybody who wants to leave, can leave now.” I
                    remember Senator Mansfield, me, Philip Alston, Kingman Brewster, and a wonderful
                    man named Sam Lewis who went on to Israel and just left last year. I always
                    forget one. Well, there were seven. Oh, Goheen; he was going to India. And I
                    remember Senator Mansfield saying, “If someone is really out to get you; they're
                    going to.” I mean, surely take precautions. I just felt I wasn't going to live
                    in fear. I'm very glad I was there the years I was rather than now, because I
                    guess ambassadors and spouses really do have security problems.</p>
                <p>The British residence in Brussels is three doors from ours and we're right across
                    from the Parc Royale, which was lovely. I walked my little dog, the predecessor
                    of Emily, every day. We'd go after breakfast. The British Ambassador, Peter
                    Wakefield, would say, “You shouldn't be walking out there by yourself.” But he
                    had the IRA to contend with. His colleague in The Hague had been shot and killed
                    just after he arrived. I really never felt any fear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prior to this time, you grew up in a very well-to-do and
                        influential family. Have you ever had any threats of kidnaping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: In the Al Capone days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember you telling me about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: One thing, though it was not a threat—I think it was in the '60's; I
                    think when Jim was in high school—the editor of our morning paper, Reg Murphy,
                    was kidnaped and they knew somehow that he had been taken across the State line,
                    so the FBI came into it. My nephew, my sister's son, is ten years older than my
                    son, and the FBI man said, “Frankly, I'm very surprised that the target was
                    neither you nor your cousin.” Fortunately, my son was on an interim trip with
                    other students from school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had to get used to living —</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I'm sure now, if I were there, I'd have to be more careful. I guess I
                    would be. I just didn't feel threatened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It hadn't escalated to the point —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, not in that country. The British ambassador, certainly, and then
                    just after I left, the Turkish Embassy was bombed. Those were for particularly
                    reasons. I mean, no one was mad at us then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your husband go to any of these briefings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, just the one on terrorism. He was the one who was frightened all
                    the time. He always thought he was going to be kidnaped; not me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And held for ransom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: The hostages were taken in Iran while I was in Belgium. What it did for
                    the morale was just awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. They knew some of the marines. Then they would start, particularly
                    the younger ones and my secretary, would start getting letters: “Get out of the
                    Foreign Service; we're worried about you. Think of the children.” It was awful
                    for their morale, the fact that this could happen. It was very shocking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It shocked people. It brought the Foreign Service to the
                        public attention. Before, people thought: “Foreign Service—that must be
                        something like the Foreign Legion.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: So many of them said they'd go home, particularly, I guess, if they
                    came from small towns, and they'd say, “They think it's a perpetual cocktail
                    party. We're just living off the government and going to wonderful places.”
                    Lord, some of the places are awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you know how hard you work.</hi>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That's right. So the last bit of the preparation was this
                    terrorism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came after your Senate hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. It was surprising, and it was something interesting: three of us,
                    “A”, “B”, and “C”; It was Alston, Brewster and Chambers at the Senate hearings
                    together. We had tried, I with my lawyer, tried to think of every possible
                    question, and the area we felt there could be questions about was what our
                    family businesses had become. I really boned up on facts and figures, and I'm
                    not good at figures. My head was so stuffed I kept thinking it was like an
                    abacus or something. We've got fifty newspapers and twelve stations, you know.
                    They did the two gentlemen, Alston, then Brewster.</p>
                <p>The presiding Senator was a charming, elderly man from Alabama. The name is
                    McReynolds. He was a courtly southern gentleman and he was really being courtly
                    to a lady. There were some routine questions, very routine, and there were
                    maybe— oh, Claiborne Pell was one I remember.</p>
                <p>I'll go back a little bit and explain: there had been quite a furor when Bert
                    Lance and Griffin Bell were appointed because of the fact that they belonged to
                    the Piedmont Driving Club in Atlanta, which is a discriminatory social club;
                    neither blacks or Jewish people belong. They had had to resign. So I thought if
                    I were asked that, this was going to be fun. I could say, “Goodness, no, I'm not
                    a member of the Driving Club. I'm one of the groups who are discriminated
                    against. There are no women members.”</p>
                <p>Senator Javits started rattling papers and said, “Let's see, now; let's see. I
                    see that you belong to an organization in Atlanta that discriminates.” And I
                    thought, “Oh, boy, Piedmont Driving Club. This is going to be fun.” I said, “Oh,
                    really, what organization is this?” He said, “The Atlanta Junior League.” I
                    haven't followed the Junior League in so many years; I was so disappointed. I
                    had long since been inactive. I think the only reason I still pay dues is
                    because they send out a yearbook including every address and phone number, and
                    it's easier than looking up a number. I said I had not been an active member for
                    a number of years and I don't know if it's discriminatory. He said, “Will you
                    look into the matter and if you find that it is, are you prepared to take the
                    proper action?” Well, The Junior League means nothing to me, so I said,
                    “Absolutely.”</p>
                <p>Afterwards, I said, “Why in the world would he mention the Junior League?” They
                    said, “Don't you realize he wasn't speaking to you; he was speaking to his
                    constituents.” I then immediately went to the phone and found that on our TV
                    station our best anchor, Monica Kaufman, who is black, is a member of the
                    Atlanta Junior League. So it no longer is.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>A friend of mine, who was divorced, and was planning to go with me as my staff
                    aide, had been going to Washington to be trained at the State Department. She
                    has always cared a great deal about the Atlanta Junior League and she said,
                    “You're not going to resign?” I said, “If it means whether I go to Belgium, I
                    would.” She said, “Oh, that would be a terrible thing. They'd be awfully upset.”
                    The President of the League called me. I mean, talk about a tempest in a teapot;
                    I thought that was stupid, ridiculous. And then, all the business details I had
                    tried to stuff into my head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that the AFSA, the American Foreign Service
                        Association, raised some sort of objection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, that objection was very upsetting. This was while I was doing my
                    preparation and I was told there was a most wonderful man, Ed Djerejian. He was
                    just made Deputy Assistant Secretary. Well, if it hadn't been for him, I don't
                    think I would have gone through with it. He was in the northern European area.
                    He's the one who took me around. He was just wonderful and very simpatico. He
                    told me this Association was going to object to Phil Alston and me and say we
                    were not qualified. This was just after Ted Sorensen had been turned down, and
                    this upset me very much. I went home for the weekend, and I returned Monday and
                    I said, “Ed, I'm not going to be another Ted Sorensen. I'm going to withdraw my
                    name if I'm not qualified.” He said, “It has nothing to do with you personally.
                    It is against any political appointees; career people feel threatened.” He said,
                    “Don't be bothered by it.” Well, I was, and several times I know I became
                    discouraged. Someone said to me, “Why in the world would you want to take on a
                    job like that, just to do pure drudgery?”. This was after the Foreign Service
                    Association controversy, and I had felt some sort of hostility from some of the
                    regular Foreign Service people. This person breezed in and said, “I just want to
                    tell you something that I don't think you hear much. I think it's wonderful to
                    have, sometimes, political appointees who are close to the President. You could
                    get information across that we cannot.”</p>
                <p>And I must say that I, again, felt antagonism during the first few months at the
                    embassy. Once there was something that was crucial to us. No one could get
                    through to the State Department, so I called Jody Powell, and he was wonderful;
                    no matter where he was, he called me back. This time he called me back from Air
                    Force One. The whole staff was impressed with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you started out for Belgium, what were your goals as
                        the President's personal envoy? What did you hope to achieve?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, I guess, I hoped to continue or even strengthen the good
                    relations between the two countries. Maybe, to in some way improve relations. I
                    had met the Saudi Ambassador and he called me one day and said that he and the
                    Lebanese and the Iranian Ambassador had leased a shoot together, and invited me
                    to come on a Tuesday, anyway mid-week, and I was very self-righteous and said
                    “Oh, Ambassador, thank you so much, but I only shoot on weekends.” He said,
                    “Madam, when three ambassadors invite you to shoot, you do not refuse.” I said,
                    “Good, I'll tell my staff that I was invited.”</p>
                <p>Tim Towell, who was my First Secretary and who was such a help to me, was the one
                    person who was really honest, and he said, “You could often do more good, get
                    more information, walking down a country road with your gun over your shoulder,
                    and the Saudi's gun over his shoulder, than at the most formal National Day
                    celebration.” [Note—Tim Towell became US Ambassador to Paraguay in September
                    1988].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. That's why, when you said you had taken up
                        shooting, I thought immediately—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, it also, as far as PR, was good. because that news preceded me
                    everywhere I went. I had invitations for everywhere. Oh, it was wonderful, and
                    of course, I loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any specifics you were supposed to pursue
                        there, such as the sale of F-16's to Belgium?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. Ambassador Firestone had had the F-16 to do, and successfully
                    completed that and that was wonderful. No; not until, as they say, the
                    “miss-eyle” [missile] crisis came along. Then we, along with the NATO
                    ambassador, were busy with it the last year, year and a half, but that was most
                    discouraging because, first of all, the Belgium Government takes so long to make
                    up their mind. They were very influenced by the Dutch on it. When the Dutch
                    Parliament turned down the missiles, then there would be a backslide, and I'd go
                    over to a minister, and say, “The State Department would like an answer.” “Oh,
                    everybody's on holiday. No one's here.” That's probably the most frustrating
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: America deals differently with things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, entirely. This is not my career in Belgium, but it points up the
                    fact: when I bought my house in France, it was the last summer. I knew I was
                    going home, and I just felt I couldn't leave Europe, so I decided which place to
                    look. I went during a Labor Day weekend because that gave me an extra day. I
                    bought my property, and somebody told me later on, that when the real estate man
                    said the property had been sold, they said, “It must have been an American.” He
                    said “Why do you say that?” They said, “Only an American would do it so
                    quickly.” I said, “I only had that one weekend, I had to go back to work.” But
                    that is true.</p>
                <p>Just a couple of months ago there were some legal documents about my property in
                    France that had to be signed by me and my son. A notaire would be coming to get
                    my signature, so my lawyer said, “Bring the document for Mrs. Chamber's son and
                    she will get it back to him.” Well, he came without it. “Oh, there wasn't enough
                    time for the secretary to type it.” It was three pages long. I said, “I really
                    feel strongly that I want this signed right away.” He said, “I promise it'll go
                    out either tomorrow or Monday.” I came back to France a month later and there it
                    was, still not typed. So I called Chip, my lawyer. He said, “Isn't this just
                    incredible? Their lack of urgency, and the red tape and bureaucracy!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the residence, fixed up before you got there, did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I did. My surroundings are important to me, and, particularly with what
                    I'd heard about the weather. My friend Robin Duke, who had been an Ambassadress
                    three times, said, “Take some of your own possessions. That really makes you
                    feel good. Take some of your favorite plates. You get awfully tired of looking
                    at the eagle on the official plates.” One of my daughters was going to be in
                    London, and, of course, I couldn't go ahead of time, so I asked her to go and
                    take a look. She wired me and said all the walls are gray, and when it's raining
                    when you get there, you're going to take one look, burst into tears and come
                    home. I asked the decorator (Stuart Gree) who was helping me at that point (the
                    Firestones had been gone quite a few months), and he really did it all over. I
                    paid for all of that myself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would a typical day be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: There wasn't a typical day, particularly in a small country, because
                    sometimes I'd go to Antwerp. That was one of the wonderful parts of the job.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: As someone said, you can go to any part of the country and be back in
                    two hours. There were many things going on in Antwerp and Ghent. There were 1200
                    American firms, so I visited places like that. I went to a newspaper plant. I
                    loved those things and I'd see other parts of the country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your relations with the Belgian press? Did they

                <p>CHAMBERS: They printed some things, but not a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told, though I have not myself read it, that
                        there was a very scurrilous article about you in Newsweek in 1979. Do you

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: There was one.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: I'd forgotten about that. I remember just before I was leaving
                    Washington, there was one in the Post. I guess it talked about the family. One
                    of those terrible—I don't remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, marvelous. Everyone I've seen, my ambassador friends; I talked to
                    Philip Alston about this. I have never met in any profession a more dedicated
                    group. I mean, obviously, it's not for the money. Really dedicated, hard
                    working, people. As I say, at first I felt some antagonism, but I truly think by
                    the time, maybe a year, in almost every case I felt that I had established a
                    rapport. Francis De Tarr, who was the Political Counselor, I always felt was
                    sort of for the have-nots, against anyone who was a political appointee. By the
                    time he left to go to Paris, maybe he respected me, and we ended up really good
                    friends, I felt. We all were working together; I think that's it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I worked with the prime minister on his first call in this country, and
                    that was exciting. Mrs. Tindemans had never been to Washington. I was very proud
                    because it was the middle of October, and it was so beautiful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. And then when the King and Queen came, I, of course, went with
                    them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That's right, that's right. But then the Carters said—and again, this
                    was something that illustrates a point: first there was going to be a luncheon
                    at the White House. Somehow I got word that the Carters had planned to just have
                    the King and Queen; just the four of them. Fortunately, I got wind of this, and
                    the fact that that would be considered inappropriate. So I did get on the phone
                    and I said, “This just simply will not do.” So they did put on an elegant
                    luncheon. It was in April, and it was all the White House vermeil, and the
                    flowers were dogwood. George Vest afterwards said, “I've been coming to lunches
                    and dinners at the White House for twenty-five years, and this was the
                    loveliest.”</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things did you do to help that along?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: What did I do? At the time we were trying to get it passed, Mary Beth
                    Busbee, who was the wife of our governor then, George Busbee; and Betty
                    Talmadge—I think her husband was still Senator—and I went to the legislature a
                    couple of times and — I've forgotten, all of us made talks. It was very
                    discouraging because the legislators said, “If we voted for that we would never
                    be reelected.” They couldn't go back to rural Georgia and say they voted for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it didn't pass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, it didn't pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were, at that time, very active on the board of the

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. At that time it was called the Fulton National Bank. It's now the
                    Bank of the South. Atlanta is in Fulton County and the bank was named for Robert
                    Fulton. In the dining room there's a big picture of his steamship. They decided
                    that it was too confining a name because they were acquiring other banks, and so
                    it was changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were active on other company boards also at that

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I was on the boards of Central Atlanta Progress and the Atlanta Chamber
                    of Commerce, the Atlanta Music Festival Association. What else did I do then?
                    It's really hard to remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I'm asking this is because some person whom I
                        have spoken to about you (in fact, it was your administrative officer)
                        boasted that you were very business-like. He thought you probably had a
                        great deal of experience in business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Heavens, I'm surprised at that. I didn't realize I was all that
                    business-like—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he thought you were. This was Eugene Champagne, and
                        he appreciated it. When you were asked to become ambassador, what
                        motivations did you have to accept this position?</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Expand your horizons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. I've always loved Europe. The idea of being in a Western
                    European country, and also of being a part of President Carter's administration,
                    when I had been so strong for him. Right from the time of the Inauguration we
                    all knew the things that he was going to champion; I mean human rights. To be
                    part of that administration was a great compliment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I told you, I think, when we last talked, that when I was leaving for
                    Brussels, I said, “I couldn't stay away from home for four years. I'll maybe
                    stay two years.” I came here when I was twenty years old, and then we traveled
                    during the war, but aside from that, I'd never lived anywhere else, and I
                    couldn't imagine being away for four years. Those four years went so
                    quickly!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really did expand your horizons, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh my, yes. Plus, as I said before, I had no idea how my life would
                    change when I came back here. I naively thought that I'd come back and my life
                    would be the same, and it hasn't been. Well, all the wonderful things that have
                    happened and are still happening to me, and that always surprise me, are because
                    of those years, As I said, I don't think I would be a director of the Coca Cola
                    company if I had just stayed here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very important, and I want to pursue that, but in
                        connection with some other questions. So if you don't mind, I'd like to get
                        back to this, taking it sequentially. When you took the Ambassador's course,
                        did either Ambassador Black or Ambassador Armstrong preside over that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet Ambassador Armstrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: In Texas, actually. I have never met Ambassador Black.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; that's something; now you're reminding me: the High Museum of Art.
                    I was involved in that. I was the first president of the Forward Arts
                    Foundation, which was started by twelve women to promote visual art, and it has
                    been a tremendous success. It's on the grounds of the Atlanta Historical
                    Society. I was president of that for quite a long time. And then, “Cities in
                    Schools.” My goodness, how could I forget that? Because that started out in
                    Atlanta as “Exodus.” It's a program for teenage kids who are school dropouts.
                    They're kids from neglected homes, and that's been one of my greatest interests.
                    It now is based in Washington and it is called “Cities in Schools.” I think they
                    are now in twelve cities and they've been asked to come to Hawaii. So, yes,
                    that's been a great, great interest. I was involved in the Southern Center for
                    International Studies for quite a few years. I have now severed all relations
                    with that organization. Then, just before I went to Brussels, I was asked to
                    become a member of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art, but I
                    went almost immediately to Belgium, so I really couldn't participate in anything
                    until I came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one in New York, you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Well I can't think of anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a bit right there. You said you did know Dean
                        Rusk. Did he give you any advice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, he was wonderful. The way I really knew him was he was very
                    involved in this Southern Center for International Studies. So we had worked
                    together on that, and he came to call on me just before I left. He had a
                    recording to send to a member of the royal family in Belgium. Well, his advice
                    to me was, “you're one of three American ambassadors there, but, since you're
                    the ambassador to the King, you're the ranking ambassador. Just remember I told
                    you.” The other advice he gave was such a wise bit. I had known Tap Bennett (our
                    ambassador to NATO) pleasantly, but not well. Rusk said, “You can lean on Tap
                    for advice and help whenever you need it.” And I leaned heavily on him. He was
                    absolutely wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember your telling me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, you know, when I was having trouble with the DCM. I had asked Tap
                    to come for lunch and I was trying to think of how I could bring it up to him,
                    and, he, in his forthright way, asked how was I finding the staff? I said,
                    “Mostly very good, but not all—some real problem. He said, “ You mean at the
                    top?” And I said, “Exactly,” and he said, “I've heard that.” I said, you know, I
                    just really don't think I can keep this man, John Ritter.” And when I told him
                    what was going on, he said, “ Of course, you can't.” To have that support, being
                    such a new ambassador, was just about the most important thing that happened in
                    the first months.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you go over that business with Ritter a little
                        bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Because of plane schedules to Brussels—at that time there was only a
                    night flight—I would have arrived, ruffled, in early morning. I decided I didn't
                    want to arrive that way, so I flew to Paris and rested and then came on a train.
                    I got in late in the afternoon, with a great friend of mine, who came with me as
                    my staff aide. She was there almost a year, and that was invaluable, too, to
                    have someone in the house just to talk to. Anyway, we arrived at the station in
                    Brussels and the DCM and his wife met me, and we went in and had a glass of
                    champagne with the station master.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the station master?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; and that was all. Then I went back to the residence and was
                    introduced to the domestic staff and then John Ritter said, “Your first
                    appointment is at a certain time tomorrow.” Apparently my secretary, who was
                    standing in as secretary and then I later requested that she remain as my
                    secretary, said that she went to him that morning and said, “Aren't you going to
                    go to the residence and escort the ambassador?” “Oh,” he said, “she can find her
                    way.” And so that is the way it started off.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Firestone had left nine or ten months before I was appointed, so you
                    see John Ritter had been in charge. I think he thought, first, [with] a
                    political appointee (I had no experience, obviously), and a woman, that he was
                    going to continue to be in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He cut you out of things? He didn't tell you what was
                        going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, no. He would just sort of announce what was to be done. I felt, I
                    don't know if hostility is the word, but, certainly, I didn't feel any
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, a terrible lack of respect.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I felt no cooperation, and I didn't feel that I was informed. As I say,
                    he'd just say, “You're doing this and this.” But the thing that really decided
                    me, and it was a little less than two weeks because one of my first appointments
                    was to go down and see General Haig at SHAPE: I had my schedule and it said I
                    was going with Dick Lawrence, who was the military attach�, who I liked very
                    much. Well, that morning Sharon, my secretary, said that Mr. Ritter was going
                    along. I said I didn't understand that; I thought it was just Colonel Lawrence.
                    She said he just decided he wanted to go. So when we got near Mons, the driver
                    said, “Would you like the flags on the car?” and John Ritter said, “No, that
                    won't be necessary.” I said that I would like the flags. I realized that was
                    just really the last straw. It was a morning appointment and then I was to stay
                    for lunch. So I got there, and very quickly the secretary came and said General
                    Haig would like to see me, and John Ritter got up at the same time. The aide
                    said, “The General will see the Ambassador alone.” We talked for an hour and a
                    half and he cooled his heels. Then Al Haig said, “ We'll go and have lunch,” and
                    he added, “I must say that I was quite surprised to be notified that your deputy
                    was coming along.” That was when I realized there was just no way.</p>
                <p>But it's strange how vibes are. We've all had to fire people. Haven't you found
                    that sometimes the situation will have been so intolerable, and then suddenly,
                    you haven't said anything—but the first morning he ever smiled coming into my
                    office was the morning I told him. How could he feel those vibes?</p>
                <p>Well, about my secretary: when I was going back and forth to Washington, I was
                    told I would have to choose a secretary; there wouldn't be one there. There were
                    two women suggested, neither of whom I could interview, and the department
                    recommended one woman. She was younger and apparently she spoke French, but I'd
                    never seen her; I'd never even talked to her on the telephone. Well, she could
                    not arrive until after I did, so Sharon Stilke was brought up from the floor
                    below to fill in. I immediately liked her. She was from Oklahoma, and we really
                    worked well together. The whole four years she called me, “Mrs. Ambassador.”
                    Everyone else, you know, said,”Madam.” I really liked Sharon. Well, then, this
                    other woman, Barbara, arrived, and I really didn't care for her. If I had met
                    her I never would have selected her. Again, you see, I was such an amateur. She
                    was very sort of prissy and uptight and she would flirt with John Ritter. I had
                    the feeling that she didn't like working for a woman at all. I had the feeling
                    she would have preferred a man. I felt that she was much more in his camp than
                    in mine. Maybe if I hadn't gotten on so well with Sharon, but the difference was
                    just striking. With Sharon, there was respect and asking me what I'd like to do.
                    With Barbara, it was, “Well, this is the schedule.” I'd say, “But I'd rather do
                    it that way.” Very soon I decided I wanted Sharon back, so I talked to Tim
                    Towell whose secretary Sharon was. He was the protocol guy. He said if I wanted
                    Sharon, that was fine, and he understood why I wanted her. I told John Ritter
                    that Barbara really was not working out, and he said, “ There are secretaries
                    and there are ambassador's secretaries, and Sharon is not that.” “Well,” I said,
                    “she's going to be, starting right now.” She stayed the whole four years. She
                    was just absolutely wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's devoted to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: You just can imagine the difference it made. I told her the only thing
                    that she ever forgot in the four years, and she was mortified by this: I wanted
                    to sent a box of Belgian chocolates by a friend who was coming back to the US,
                    and she forgot to have them picked up. That was the only thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right? Well, that's a pretty good record, isn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Really! I talked to Tap Bennett. George Vest was my immediate boss, and
                    Tap said, “You just tell George Vest what's going on.” So that's what happened.
                    But Tap gave me the strength to do it [to ask for Ritter's transfer].</p>
                <p>I arrived in June and then in October, the then prime minister, Leo Tindemans,
                    who is now the foreign minister, was going on an official visit to Washington,
                    and so of course I went with him. When I arrived back in Brussels, I, again,
                    arrived by train. All the officers were there; at least ten people with their
                    wives, and I said, “But this is wonderful; what's going on?” They said, “This is
                    the way your arrival should have been, and we all knew that.” They were just
                    appalled by John Ritter's reception of my arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned having called Jody Powell. He always
                        answered you, but this particular time he called you from Air Force One.
                        What was the problem? Can you recall why you had to get in touch with
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, I think there was a Belgian day at the Paris Air Show, and there
                    was a Chinese official and they were talking about buying the F-16. They needed
                    some advice from the embassy, because they didn't know which way to go. It was
                    Dick Lawrence who was the military attach�, and we were out at the air show. So
                    I said I would get somebody at the White House.</p>
                <p>I guess Dick made the call; we were all sitting around. I said to ask for Jody
                    Powell, because he was the one I would call, and we were told, “He's en route
                    with the President to the talks in Vienna.” Dick said, “Oh, dear, we really must
                    talk with someone immediately.” “Oh, well,” they said, “We'll put you through to
                    Air Force One.” That was very good for all of the career people; they were very
                    impressed that in ten minutes I got him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the advantage of a political Ambassador. How soon
                        was that incident? Can you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. It must have been the following summer; at least the following
                    summer, because the Air Show was always in June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any goals, sort of roughed out in your mind,
                        of what you wanted to achieve while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You just wanted to tell what Carter was —</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I often cut out quotations, and I was looking at one last night. It
                    bears on what you just asked me, so let me go and get it. “I never intended
                    anything in my life. People don't understand that, but I've just drifted in and
                    out, in and out. I had no star that I looked for or followed. My whole life has
                    been an event.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really. And that sums yours up, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, really, I had no star that I looked for or followed. The girls of
                    my generation, as my roommate at school said, “Nobody ever told us to be
                    somebody, so we didn't.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Really. Of course, there were some people our age who did have a star,
                    who did have a goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but it was the exception.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. I had no thought of a career. Everything has just sort of
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given instructions by the [Belgian] desk, before
                        you left, to pursue any particular line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing crucial going on at the time that you were going
                        to have to pick up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS:No, because the F16 had been settled; that was it. The last two years,
                    though, we were, even in my embassy, as well as NATO, busy with the decision of
                    putting missiles in Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the big thing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: You know the Belgians are very influenced by the Dutch Parliament, and
                    so they wait for them to vote. Then you know how those European countries just
                    close down in the summer. We'd say, “We really must have a decision by the 15th
                    of July.” Well, then the Prime Minister is on holiday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know exactly what you mean. They didn't make the
                        decision before you left, did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, finally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, but then it was tentative, depending on Holland. Tap was just
                    totally immersed in that.</p>
                <p>What was I going to say, something about—oh, yes, my friend, Natasha Spender,
                    made a remark last summer—we're about the same age—talking about youth, or being
                    the age we are, and she said, “Each era of my life has been better than the one
                    before.” And I thought about it, and I realized that I could say the same thing.
                    I never thought in those terms at all. Again, I just relate everything BB,
                    before Belgium and after. One thing that is sort of amusing about Coca Cola: I
                    was elected to the board of Coca Cola, and then shortly after, Don McHenry
                    [former US ambassador the U.N.] was also elected. And he calls the two of us
                    “the odd couple;” which is true. He said, “You know it was just very good timing
                    for us that we both got out of the Foreign Service when big companies were
                    deciding they should have a woman and a black on the board.” And it was true.
                    But, as I say, I can't believe I would have been chosen as that woman if I
                    hadn't had that experience in Belgium.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To give you that high profile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Even though I lived in Atlanta. Well, that's just my guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We spoke before about the presentation of credentials and
                        how your son rode along on his bicycle and waved at you, and then we moved
                        to the restaurant and I didn't pick up on the end of that. Could you give me
                        a little picture of how exactly you presented the credentials? How long it
                        took? Did you withdraw Firestone's credentials before you presented
                        yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, no. It really was very exciting. Our residence faces the Parc
                    Royale. At one end of the Parc is the Parliament and at the other is the palace,
                    and so whenever a new ambassador was presenting his credentials, the horses,
                    with the riders, went by the residence and it is the most beautiful sight. If I
                    had a guest or guests staying and we'd hear the horses, somebody would go and
                    knock on their door and say, “Look out the window. Here they come, all in their
                    uniforms, with beautiful horses.” The fur was brushed in a checkerboard pattern
                    and they would just gleam. It was just marvelous. So the Grand Marechal came to
                    escort me in the King's Mercedes, which was practically like sitting in this
                    sofa with two chairs. It was in the morning. I wore just a short dress, but my
                    staff were all in white tie. Q: Did you wear a hat?</p>
                <p>CHAMBERS:No. I asked about that, but they said, no. We were received and then the
                    King took me in the room by myself. He had really done his homework. He's very
                    impressive; his knowledge, and such dedication. President Carter had, just
                    before I came, made his speech at Notre Dame on human rights, and he mentioned
                    that and he said that he hoped to meet the president, because his whole
                    philosophy on human rights was so impressive and so the way he himself felt. I
                    think I told you before I always felt that Carter's stand on human rights, on
                    the Panama Canal treaty, and Camp David, all were far more appreciated in Europe
                    than in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that; yes. Don't you think as time passes
                        they will be more and more appreciated here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, yes. Certainly, human rights will. So the King mentioned that.
                    Then, of course, I called on the prime minister. Every person in the government
                    mentioned that speech. Since it was June, there were several new ambassadors and
                    the one, oh maybe a day or so after my presentation, was the ambassador from
                    Thailand, and so at everything official we sat next to each other for four
                    years. He had the dearest little wife. I'd never really had Thai food, so I used
                    to go to their embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>So I was in Washington just a couple of weeks ago, and Perry Stieglitz, who was
                    my cultural attach said, “The new ambassador in Thailand would like to see you.
                    Would you come and have drinks?” I said, “Well, that's very nice, but why does
                    he want to meet me?” He said, “It's your old friend and he's just come to
                    Washington as Ambassador.” So that's a nice reconnection. Then the interesting
                    thing, I had gone up to Washington for the Meridian House Ball because the Coca
                    Cola company sponsored it this year, and I mentioned the fact that that was the
                    reason for my coming, because of Coca Cola. He said that his family was one of
                    five families who started the first Coca Cola bottling plant in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't it odd, these coincidences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh yes. His brother apparently is still very active in it, so he is
                    very anxious now to come to Atlanta to do a presentation to the Mayor and to the
                    city, the business people. We're setting that up for the spring. I told him I'd
                    never been to the Far East, but the Coca Cola Company's October meeting will be
                    in Japan. I said, “I finally now will be going there, so I want to travel around
                    and go to other countries.” Oh, he said, “That's wonderful.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any delay to your presenting your credentials?
                        Was that within a week of the time that you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: It was, I would say, ten days. I arrived in Paris at the time of the
                    air show and I said I would like to go to it. Well, that was a problem because I
                    would not have presented my credentials and it would not have been proper for me
                    to go. So I didn't do that. June was a good month, before the King went on
                    holiday. The National Day is July 21st, so that's why there were several new
                    ambassadors at the same time. About the first week in July, we went to tea at
                    Leghen Palace, which is just on the outskirts, where the King and Queen actually
                    live. They had a tea for the new ambassadors, which was very nice. I think there
                    were about nine of us. Then I remember meeting some other new ambassadors who
                    arrived during the summer, and, of course, they really couldn't do anything;
                    they couldn't start attending anything, so mine was good timing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you took your country team with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, I remember Gene Champagne all done up in white tie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Belgians react to having a woman ambassador?
                        You were the first woman ambassador. Did they not care, because what was
                        important is the fact that you were the [US] ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, I don't think they did care. There was an article in a Brussels
                    paper, maybe the Chamber of Commerce magazine, I can't remember what it was, but
                    there was an article about me before I came. One of the things the article said
                    was how much I liked shooting, and that was a great plus, because immediately I
                    had invitations for that coming fall, and every weekend I went on these
                    wonderful shoots. They were very pleased about that. No, I was told and I
                    repeated it several times as a joke—the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg is the
                    sister of King Baudouin and neither of those families have much sense of humor,
                    so I doubt this—but the story was that the Luxembourg Royal family called and
                    said, “If you don't want a lady ambassador, we can tell you how to get rid of
                    her.” Apparently, when a new ambassador was being appointed to Luxembourg they
                    said, “We've had enough women. We want a man.” And that's when Jim Lowenstein
                    was appointed. But the King, supposedly said, “Oh, no, we don't object; we've
                    never had a woman, and so that's perfectly fine.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: US relations with the Belgians were, as they usually are,
                        very good at the time you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of the mission? How many people did you
                        have working for you? Was it a couple of hundred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, more than that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More than that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Does 350 sound reasonable?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds reasonable, yes. That big a mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are an awful a lot of Americans in Belgium, aren't
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh yes, the American companies. At that time there were more than 1500
                    American companies. The Singer Sewing Machine Company had been there since the
                    beginning of this century.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend much of your time with the American business
                        community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I visited all of the big plants. The Chamber of Commerce is very
                    anxious for the Ambassador to be involved in that. That's very important. And
                    the Fulbright Commission, too. I was on that board; I think it's the custom for
                    the ambassador. I was very interested in that, being educational, and Perry
                    Stieglitz was as well, so we would go to those things together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to develop a close relationship with the
                        prime minister? Or doesn't one do that in a country like Belgium?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: They're very formal people, you know. I would say that I had a warmer
                    relationship with [Prime Minister] Leo Tindemans than with Mr. Martens [the
                    subsequent prime minister], and I think it was their personalities. Mrs.
                    Tindemans was charming. I never met Mrs. Martens.</p>
                <p>This was little amusing bit about the Belgium problem: Mr. Tindemans had been
                    away in the summer, so I hadn't had him to dinner in the residence. We were then
                    getting ready to go to Washington together on his visit, so I asked if he would
                    like an official dinner or would he like to come just with his wife and my
                    husband and me. He said he preferred that, so I asked him to come to my little
                    house that I rented in the country, outside of Brussels. He was very pleased,
                    because it was the last Flemish area near Brussels. It was surrounded by the
                    French-speaking part of the country, and he was very pleased that I chose it.
                    (It just happened that that little house was there.) I remember I served
                    brussels sprouts and he refused to eat them because of the word “brussels.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, they are that touchy? Was he the foreign
                        minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: He was the prime minister. He's now the foreign minister. I had a
                    closer relationship with Henri Simonet, who was the foreign minister. His was
                    the opposition party, and I was amazed when the prime minister went to
                    Washington on that official visit, Henri Simonet as the leader of the opposition
                    insisted on coming along. He said that their views had to be presented to the
                    president, to the Department. To me, with our form of government, this was just
                    amazing. You know, would the leader of the Democratic party have gone to
                    Reykjavik? I found that very interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>When we got back, Henri Simonet said he wanted to invite me to come either for
                    breakfast or lunch in his office. I said I really didn't like breakfast
                    meetings; I would be delighted to come for lunch, so we did have lunch in his
                    office. He has quite a sense of humor, and he said, “I understand you resisted
                    my offer of breakfast?” And I said, “ Yes, Mr. Minister, I did. I really like to
                    have breakfast alone.” He said, “I wanted to ask you to come for lunch because I
                    feel, and this is my fault, that you have not been presented with the policies
                    of my party. As I say, I feel it has been my fault, and I just wanted to tell
                    you how we feel and what our differences are.” I said I'd enjoyed the lunch and
                    I hoped he would come to the residence. Well, then he was campaigning for
                    re-election, and I thought he was probably too busy, so I didn't ask him for
                    some time. I ran into him somewhere, and he said, “You have not returned my
                    invitation.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Blunt, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, very. I said, “Well, I just felt with the campaign that you would
                    have said no.” “Now the campaign's over,” he said. So this became a regular
                    exchange of visits. He did then come, and maybe six weeks later he would invite
                    me back again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find getting to know these people is more a
                        question of personality than it is of what they are minister of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: To a great extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a person-to-person thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I mean there was no reason for him to [exchange visits]; it wasn't
                    required. Again, it's vibes. With some people there's more rapport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the personal touch is really very, very important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, yes. And the thing you asked about how the Belgians felt, well,
                    certainly at the beginning and, in a way, all through my years, people would
                    constantly say, “You seem to enjoy being here so much.”</p>
                <p>Then some people, oh, after I'd been there three years, would still ask if I
                    liked being there, if I liked my job? I would just say, I wouldn't still be
                    here. You know that was just sort of a dumb question.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine the enthusiasm that you show opens a lot of
                        doors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, I would assume in any country, but maybe more in Belgium, being a
                    small country. You know, they do have a feeling of being smaller than our other
                    allies, like France, Germany, England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Overwhelmed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they're touchy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. I think that maybe they were more pleased and surprised by how
                    much I liked being there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the press report on your activities much? The Belgian
                        press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, the custom was for the ambassador to address the first meeting of
                    the Chamber of Commerce in the fall, and that was always reported but not to a
                    great extent.</p>
                <p>I don't know if I told you my terrible faux pas when President Carter came. That
                    was very much reported, and on television. He had been, I think, to seven
                    countries, and Belgium was his last stop. The three US ambassadors, naturally,
                    were at the plane, and I was first in line since I was with the King. When he
                    got off, he kissed me. The next day at my staff meeting, one of my officers
                    said, “We were very proud to see you were the only ambassador on this trip to be
                    kissed by the President.” Well, obviously, I was the only woman. I said,
                    “There's nothing queer about our President.”</p>
                <p>The next day was Saturday, and I was at a shoot near Antwerp and there was a man
                    who was always kind of teasing me and sort of flirting and he said, “Oh, I know
                    what you were up to last week.” We were at lunch in the middle of the shoot, and
                    we were speaking French. He said, “Ah, I saw you being kissed by your President
                    as he stepped off of the plane.” Then I said, in French, “Oh, yes, my country
                    team was very proud that I was the only ambassador to be kissed by the
                    President.” Well, I said the word in French, and you know the difference between
                    the—[In French “kiss” is a euphemism for sex.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I didn't know what I had said, and everyone was laughing. I mean there
                    were these hoots of laughter, and my husband, who was at the other table, said,
                    “What in the world did you say?” “Well, I said something awful.”</p>
                <p>On Monday my French teacher came. Brigitte Verbeek was a darling young Belgian
                    woman, and we really became friends. I said, “Brigitte, your reputation is
                    ruined. You're never going to have another pupil. This is just terrible.” And
                    when I told her, of course she turned beet red.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughs) Of course, she did. Well, they ought to tell you
                        that the word baiser doesn't always means what it's supposed to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, that was the worst. But, of course, that was the most widely
                    reported occasion. Oh, and then this one: the Carters got along very well with
                    the King and Queen, so they spent the whole day in Brussels and then they were
                    leaving. They were going to fly back to Washington that night. The King and
                    Queen came to the airport and the President said, “Oh, but your wife speaks the
                    most beautiful English. This is very impressive. She speaks really without an
                    accent.” Brzezinski was standing there, and he said as a joke, “Well, you know
                    there are a lot of people in Washington who have a hard time understanding you.
                    You know, with your south ern accent there are a lot of us who don't really get
                    every word you're saying.” President Carter laughed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have mentioned the Chamber of Commerce in Belgium. Did
                        they actually consult with you about business problems? Or with your
                        economic counselor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. And Bob Kaufman was really good. He left. I lost him and I lost my
                    political counselor, Francis De Tarr, I think in the same month. I said they
                    were both “stolen.” Francis went to the same job in the embassy at Paris. He's
                    retired now, but his whole interest and his career has been France. He wrote a
                    book, I think, about the liberal party in France. That has been his whole
                    dedication, so to have that as his last post was wonderful. I couldn't
                    argue.</p>
                <p>Then Bob had—he was funny. He used to say he was a ladies' man, because he had
                    worked for Anne Armstrong before me. He was asked to come back to the U.N., and
                    his immediate boss was a woman. She wasn't the head of the mission there,
                    because that would have been Don McHenry or Andy Young. He was terrific. As I
                    say, there are so many American companies in Belgium, a very active Chamber of
                    Commerce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you place emphasis on one particular area? How did you
                        divide your time? On political, or public affairs, or economic development,
                        or what was your major interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, I tried to divide my time. Incidentally, I heard that when
                    Ambassador Price was in Belgium, he, having been a banker, was very interested
                    in the Chamber of Commerce and the business life of Brussels.</p>
                <p>One thing I started doing, which apparently hadn't been done, was to say to each
                    section chief; Francis De Tarr, Bob Kaufman, Gene Champagne, each department
                    head, “Ask who you want,” and then we had sort of working lunches in the
                    residence. The labor man, for instance, said he'd never been asked to do that.
                    My whole staff was very pleased about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine. Nobody ever turns down an invitation from
                        an ambassador, so they could get people they wouldn't otherwise see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, and these were the, as they said, people who wouldn't have been
                    invited to the Embassy otherwise. I know it was interesting for me.</p>
                <p>I think, because of all of the American involvement in Brussels as well as the
                    whole country, I was asked to attend openings, in the World Trade Center, and
                    the book fair, and the automobile show; everything, because there was always an
                    American emphasis in all of these. As I say, I went all around the country to
                    the plants, and I loved that.</p>
                <p>General Motors, I think, has been there fifty years. I was at a dinner with the
                    head of General Motors in Belgium and someone asked him if the labor prices
                    weren't terribly high in Belgium. He said, “Yes, they are, but the quality of
                    workmanship is also very high.” But then, of course, particularly the last two
                    years, we had to face the fact that some American companies were moving to the
                    Far East, because they had to. I mean, computers . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I understand that in the north of Belgium they had a
                        flourishing computer business; high tech.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Of course, the Belgians would just moan. We all just dreaded each
                    announcement. They had no choice. To be able to compete, they had to be able to
                    pay the same lower wages.</p>
                <p>But big companies like General Motors and Ford do feel the quality of workmanship
                    is so high that it's worth the cost of labor. At least they did. I don't know if
                    they've changed since I've left but I really enjoyed going around all those.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Then, of course, my interest in the arts and all of that may well haves been
                    partly because of Perry Stieglitz. Again, it was vibes. I told him he made
                    working fun because he had such enthusiasm. We just shared so many interests. He
                    said I gave more attention to that than maybe had been done before by some other
                    ambassadors, particularly men, I guess. A lot of that, really, was not only by
                    choice but on my after-hours. For every American entertainer who came, Jessye
                    Norman, Isaac Stern, I always had a dinner or a reception.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel Washington gave you a free hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: You mean financially?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I know that you spent your own money, but did they

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you got enough policy guidance from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We know you had access to the President, and I suppose
                        Belgium being where it is, you had a awful lot of CODELS [Congressional
                        delegations] didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. We had every member of the cabinet come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every member of the cabinet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: We did have a lot of CODELs and often on long weekends; Labor Day or
                    Easter or something like that. People used to say, “You must get tired of
                    those.” Well, I didn't, because I felt it was so important that they come and
                    visit SHAPE and understand about NATO. There were so many governors,
                    congressmen, just groups who would say: “But we had no idea what NATO was all
                    about; what it's doing and how wonderful this is.” Wives, as well as husbands. I
                    often had to cancel [other] plans for weekends, but, again, that was part of the
                    job. I met Senator [Howard] Baker; I was impressed with him. The one now I'm
                    reading so much about since the election, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, he
                    addressed a group from Parliament and he was marvelous. He was so on the ball
                    and bright and concerned, he was just very, very impressive. And then every year
                    in Brussels was the Foreign Ministers' NATO Conference, and then the Defense
                    Ministers, so our Secretary of State would come and our Secretary of
                    Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did those visits always go smoothly? Your staff would
                        handle them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, no. You see, it really wasn't our staff; it would have been Tap
                    Bennett's staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would it? I wondered how you divided up the entertaining
                        with the other two ambassadors. CHAMBERS: For those two conferences, they
                        would do the entertaining, and I would be asked to come. I met all of them
                        at the airport. I knew the Vances, but that was Tap's department. The last
                        two years, almost two years, our ambassador to the European Community was
                        Tom Enders. Now he is retired from the Foreign Service and he has joined
                        Salomon Brothers.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were consular matters a major problem? American
                        welfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Not really. Well, it was an on-going concern. Oh, I remember one thing
                    that happened. It must have been August and there was a airline with cheaper
                    fares, and it went bankrupt, so there were all these Americans just stranded,
                    and they literally didn't have any place to sleep. Some of the young ones had no
                    money. They had thought, “We're going home Thursday, so we just need enough
                    money till then.” That was a terrible, terrible problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, we found places for them to stay, and in some instances gave them
                    enough money. Our embassy had to find other flights for them, and you see they'd
                    chosen these flights because of the price, so they didn't want go on others. Oh,
                    that was awful. That was one problem. Are consul generals sometimes sort of a
                    problem to the ambassador? I mean, they become too —</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They can be. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: John Hyman was there and his wife Judy worked in our mission to the
                    European Community. They were really wonderful. He was in Antwerp. There, again,
                    I became very friendly with them. Then they left. I can't remember the man who
                    came, but he was sort of a little king, I think.</p>
                <p>Then something happened. It was the wonderful pageant in Bruges; the Holy Blood,
                    and the procession of the Holy Blood. We were told that we couldn't drive up to
                    the stand. All the streets were blocked off, so I walked and the heir to the
                    throne, Prince Albert, and his sister, arrived on foot. I mean everyone did, all
                    the other ambassadors. We were all sitting there, and just before the pageant
                    began, a black car came up and it had the American flag on it. It was our consul
                    general. Of course, everyone teased me. I had arrived on foot along with the
                    Royal family, and he came by car. He wasn't embarrassed at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you say, sometimes they get a bit of a superiority
                        complex.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: The department used to own a house. They sold it, oh, a long time ago.
                    The Hymans were in an apartment that really wasn't adequate, because they were
                    very good at entertaining. Antwerp, you know, Flanders, now is the economic
                    power. It really was a hardship for them. I just can't remember the man who
                    replaced them. He felt that the consulate should have a residence, and he was
                    right; they shouldn't have sold the one before, because it was poor economy. So
                    I did help him, making calls to Washington. Then at one point there was talk of
                    closing that consulate. Well, that, really would be disastrous as far as PR in
                    that country. So we protested that. That would be worse than Nice, because Nice,
                    is to such a great extent, tourism, and Antwerp, of course. is not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any intra-mission rivalries that you were
                        aware of, say, between your political and economic section, or between your
                        economic and your CIA, or whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Again, I think it's a question of personalities. I think everyone
                    managed it very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who kept you informed of any problems of a personal nature
                        at the Embassy? You might, for example, have had problems of alcoholism. I
                        don't know that you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: There was one after Gene Champagne left and Larry Russell had replaced
                    him. My friend, too. He was the one who handled it and he was terrific. Another
                    who helped with problems was Tim Towell. He was my great support in getting rid
                    of John Ritter. His wife had gone to school with my daughter and partly because
                    of that and perhaps because he was from Ohio, he was the person who would speak
                    more freely to me my first weeks there. And that was tremendously helpful.</p>
                <p>Emily White, my friend, who was my staff aide, became very friendly with the
                    Towells. They could say things to her about the behavior of John Ritter. Tim was
                    the one who really spoke out so. When John Ritter was leaving, I said, “Who is
                    going to replace him?” Well, Art Olsen was the political counselor, and so it
                    was Tim's suggestion that Art could take over.</p>
                <p>Well, then he became very macho. I told you the story of the day the hostages
                    were taken in Iran and he didn't tell me that. He didn't tell me that same month
                    a mosque was bombed, you remember?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do indeed. In Mecca, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, he didn't tell me anything about it. He was very male-chauvinist,
                    and that was a disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This developed slowly, did it? You started out all
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, yes. Well, I was so relieved to have someone to replace John
                    Ritter. Then the prime minister's mother died, and he did not tell me when the
                    funeral was. As I say, I had gone to Washington with the Tindemans. I didn't
                    know about the funeral. In the next few days someone said that there had been
                    criticism; that whoever was sent by the embassy the Belgians felt was not
                    important enough. Well I would have gone. It was just this sort of thing, so
                    when this thing with the hostages happened, I couldn't put up with that. Again I
                    talked with Tap and I said, “I know that George Vest is a good friend of Art
                    Olsen,” and Tap said, “Yes, but he's too much a professional to let that
                    interfere.” I went to see George in Washington, and I said, “This is awful to be
                    coming a second time.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period of time is involved in this? Another year or

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Two, I guess, at the most. Because then Ed Keller came and we really
                    worked well together, because he was cooperative and respectful, but he was very

                <p>CHAMBERS: No, not just a yes man. But anyway, when Gene Champagne was leaving,
                    and Larry Russell was being sent to Brussels, apparently George Vest told him
                    the story of me and the DCM and said, “I want you to go and find out what this
                    is all about.” And Larry said, “I think it's either the ravings of a madwoman or
                    else it's the most disgraceful behavior I've ever heard of toward an ambassador.
                    I will go and give you my opinion on which it was.”</p>
                <p>He told me this later and he said it was the most disgraceful behavior he'd ever
                    heard of in his years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he the gentleman who played Santa Claus for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, yes. He was divorced and his two children were living with him. He
                    was marvelous; he was the one who kept me abreast about people, and he was very,
                    very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any serious problems with your personnel at
                        all? Did you have to send people home, or evacuate people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: The only thing was that Sharon became ill, and then she had to be flown
                    to Frankfurt [for treatment].</p>
                <p>So I remember Susan Miller had become my staff aide, and we were trying to find
                    out when Sharon was going. We really thought she was dying, she had lost so much
                    weight, and I said, “Well I'm going to Frankfurt. She cannot die there alone.”
                    That was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to Frankfurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. She got better, and I don't know; I've forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She's very grateful to you for that entire time. She said
                        you saved her life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well the interesting thing, she very much wanted to go back to Dallas,
                    which was near the town where her parents lived. She finally was well enough to
                    go on a stretcher. They didn't know what it was, they thought they had corrected
                    it. Soon she came back to work, and oh, I remember how thin she was. She was
                    always skinny anyway, and her face was just bone. And then it started up again,
                    in the middle of the night. All they could do—they couldn't even get as far as
                    SHAPE, so they just went to an emergency room in a Belgian hospital. There was a
                    doctor who had been in Zaire and he finally found it was a microbe she had
                    contracted in Zaire. He said American doctors would not even be aware of
                    this.</p>
                <p>Then her husband and children were checked. She said, “But we've been gone from
                    Zaire for two years,” and he said, “But these stayed.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incubated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Incubated, but this particular one attacks the liver and that's what's
                    caused all the trouble,—so it was lucky for her she was in Belgium. It was
                    amazing really. Well, I don't remember any other problems like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:Did you feel part of the Service? Did you, after awhile,
                        begin to feel you were part of the Foreign Service yourself? Part of the
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, I did. Yes, because you get so interested in it. If someone is
                    leaving to go to another post, you just listen to all of them talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It does sort of become a family, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. Phil Alston, who was in Australia—we would talk together and
                    we were both, just from the beginning, so impressed with the dedication and how
                    hard people in the Foreign Service work. I don't think it's recognized enough.
                    And certainly it's not done for money. The embassy children would say they'd go
                    home to wherever they came from and their friends would say, “You have such a
                    glamorous life.” Of course it's such a wonderful life, and I think for their
                    children it is. But some of them, particularly Lorna and Bill Ramsay and Sharon
                    told me they realized very soon that when they'd go home, they'd be so full of
                    what they'd been doing they couldn't wait to tell their families, and the
                    families really had no interest. And that was very disappointing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. There's no point of connection. You very
                        soon learn not to mention it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That's what they said, and that this was very disappointing; that their
                    parents, particularly weren't interested. Then, of course, when the hostages
                    were taken, their parents really wanted them to come home. That was very
                    demoralizing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine. Although Belgium was hardly the Middle
                        East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. You asked did I feel part of the family? There were a couple of
                    Marines taken hostage who were known to my staff and I felt terrible. The
                    Marines were so darling to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tim Towell spoke to me of successes with the Chinese while
                        you were there, and he mentioned particularly that your husband helped in
                        that he was very good at talking to them. Can you remember what this was all
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That's good that Tim mentioned that, because it's interesting. When I
                    arrived, we didn't have formal relations with China, and the ambassador at that
                    time, oh, he was so stiff. And not only he was always in a Mao jacket, but his
                    wife was as well, and she always spoke of him as “my comrade.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I mean, they were obviously so anti-capitalist, he could barely even
                    say hello. Then he went home and he was replaced. Of course, we all wondered who
                    was coming next. The new one came to call on me and he really was pretty much
                    the opposite. He was a big man and very friendly. Tim worked very hard, that was
                    one of his areas, working with the Chinese ambassador. Oh, I know what happened.
                    He wanted to make an appointment to call on me and Tim said, “You're going to
                    find this ambassador different from the other one.” I think maybe Tim suggested,
                    or maybe I did, that I ask him for tea instead of coming to the embassy, because
                    of this strange relationship. When I asked him to come for tea he asked if he
                    could bring his wife. Well, he was pleased to see that I had some Oriental
                    things, and I had a terra cotta camel that I have in France now, and he said,
                    “Oh, that was one of the things that used to be buried with a high priest.”</p>
                <p>Then he said he understood that I liked Chinese food and I said I absolutely
                    loved it, so they had us to a dinner. It was the Ambassador and his wife and his
                    deputy and his wife, and the Towells and my husband and myself. We would sit at
                    a round table and have a lazy Susan with all of these marvelous things on it. He
                    would ladle out the soup and I remember one time, he ladled out something and I
                    asked, “Oh, what is this?” And he said, “It's sea slugs. It's very good; it's
                    very beneficial for elderly gentlemen. It makes them young again; very
                    spirited.”</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I said, “Oh, good, give me some more. Does it do the same for elderly ladies?”
                    Well, he had a sense of humor. He said, “Oh, that's wonderful. You may just run
                    back to your Embassy instead of riding.”</p>
                <p>I got a call about three one morning saying that we were establishing formal
                    relations with China, so, of course, I called him first thing in the morning,
                    and he was very, very pleased about this. I said, “Now I can have an official
                    dinner for you.” Which I did. And he never missed a National Day celebration,
                    and I never did either.</p>
                <p>That's really one reason we became so friendly. He'd say how appreciative really
                    small countries were, and he said, “You know, other ambassadors need not go, but
                    if the American and the Chinese ambassadors come, that is a great compliment. It
                    was known that the Russian ambassador never went anywhere. He never came to
                    mine; always an excuse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Tim said that your work with the Chinese was very
                        fruitful; very good. What was your preferred type of entertainment? Working

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I really liked all of it.</p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Well, I liked to entertain, but not just for entertaining. I just
                    met such interesting people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you gave the businessmen's luncheons, was it at all
                        awkward that you were the only woman present?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No. Sometimes there would be one or two others; members of the staff.
                    No, I really never felt awkward, and I don't think the men did.</p>
                <p>

                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, they did. Oh, I can remember everybody shaking. Then there were
                    three women who came and they said, “We've been sent to see how the new
                    ambassadors are doing. They were very honest about being sent out to appraise
                    political ambassadors. I had many receptions. I remember a group of American
                    doctors. There were such interesting people in this group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your friend went back to the States, you had
                        somebody else who was assigned as your staff—I don't know what they call
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Susan Miller, whose husband was at our mission to the European
                    Community, and she was just wonderful. I interviewed her, and she was with me
                    until they were sent back to Washington and then he left the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she take over in setting up these parties and choosing
                        the menus and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Not the menus; we would do that together. She did what an ambassador's
                    wife would do, coping with domestic staff, but I would say what I wanted. I
                    mean, we would look at the menus, but all the personality problems and the place
                    cards—she didn't do seating arrangements for dinners. Elizabeth Courtin was our
                    Belgian protocol secretary, and she was highly thought of in other embassies.
                    Ambassadors' wives used to say that they envied me her. She's still there. She
                    was marvelous because she came to every dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you inherit your chef from the Firestones, or did you

                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Josie, the maitre d' was there, and he stayed the whole time. The
                    Firestones had brought a cook, a French cook, and he retired to the south of
                    France. A cook had been put there, and she just wasn't good at all. I said
                    particularly in Belgium there has to be a good chef. Then we got a resume of one
                    who said she'd worked for Ambassador Bruce. I couldn't get in touch with
                    Evangeline Bruce, but I said, “I've had lunch at their house in Washington and
                    it was marvelous, so let's try her.” Oh, it was just terrible! Later on, I saw
                    Evangeline, and she said, “I can't believe she told you she was the embassy
                    cook. She cooked for the children in the nursery. Good heavens, she could never
                    handle official dinners.” Tap Bennett was away, so instead of calling on him at
                    NATO, I called on his deputy, Ed Streator, who had been chosen by Kingman
                    Brewster to come and be his deputy in London. I said to Tim, who was helping me
                    in this dilemma, “I had the most delicious lunch,” and he said (the Streators
                    were great friends of the Towells), “I'm glad to hear you say that because
                    Gian-Carlo, the chef, doesn't want to stay on with Ed Streator's replacement.
                    They have five little children and he's afraid he'd be making hamburgers and
                    peanut butter sandwiches.” Gian-Carlo was really young, oh, 22 or 23. He was
                    Italian, but he had his training in Brussels. He stayed the whole time, and he
                    was wonderful. The Rogers [General Bernard Rogers, Supreme Allied Commander
                    Europe, SHAPE] are amazing because their cooks are all from the American
                    military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know; they never have to worry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, but they have to train these people. I mean, it's a worry as to
                    what kind of cooking they do. I spent a couple of days with them in May. They
                    have had different cooks; and I said, “If anything, your food gets better. There
                    is no better food.” Bernie said, “We made up our minds when we came to Belgium
                    that we were going to have food that the US and the Army wouldn't be ashamed
                    of.” But that's Ann Rogers. She makes everything seem so easy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, dear, what a question! Well, as every ambassador knows, the purpose
                    of being there is to promote, not only good, but maybe improve the relations
                    between the two countries, so I would like to think I'd done that.</p>
                <p>Did I mention Sabena? Jimmy Carter had gone on a trip to Belgium when he was
                    Governor, so he knew that Sabena wanted to establish a direct route,
                    Brussels-Atlanta.</p>
                <p>Just when I arrived in Belgium is when the heat was on; they had decided that the
                    time had come. They had the money for the planes and everyone, starting with the
                    King, would say, “Well, of course, this is going through, isn't it?”</p>

                <p>The FAA had to [give approval] so I would try to explain that. They would reply,
                    “Oh, your President is aware of this and you're a friend of his.”</p>
                <p>I really sweated out that summer because I said if this hadn't gone through, I
                    would have been the culprit, and I didn't want to go home. I got a lot of credit
                    for [the eventual approval] and I didn't deserve it. [Sabena] is owned by the
                    government, so they cared very deeply. [The approval] was not because of me, but
                    it was a plus [for me], a mark of success.After the King and Queen had gone to
                    Washington, I went to call on the King. President Carter had sent him a book, so
                    I gave it to him and he opened it. It was a book about the South. He looked at
                    it and said, “I have something for you.” I couldn't imagine what it was. He
                    walked over to a table and there was a long box containing a decoration. It was
                    the second highest order of the Ordre de la Couronne. It's one of those big
                    beautiful things you wear with sashes, and I was just overcome. I was only the
                    second American ambassador to ever receive it. William Burden had received it.
                    That was just staggering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It shows that in King Baudouin's eyes you certainly were
                        successful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I don't know of any great successes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you left anything unresolved when you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No, not really, because we had been so concerned over the missiles, and
                    it was such a relief that that was settled. No, I left with happy thoughts.
                    People would say, “If President Carter's reelected, would you stay on?” I really
                    wouldn't have. I think four years is a very good length. No Belgians could say,
                    “You really didn't like it here.” So in that way, it was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many parties a week did you go to or give,
                        Ambassador?Every night? Five nights out of the seven?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Not that many. Now the Rogers either come to Brussels or they give
                    something, I bet, five nights a week. There are 86 embassies so there were all
                    those national days. There would often be two on the same evening. Sometimes
                    they were at noon, but the majority were in the evening, so I'd often go to one
                    or two and then to a dinner. I enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to all the national days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Several people have mentioned to me that you did that;
                        it's quite a feather in your cap that you did, because they're not all that
                        enjoyable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No; but the small African countries [parties] were. Plus, information
                    that I picked up. It's not just appearing and signing the book, it's things I'd
                    hear. I may have mentioned when I first got there I thought I had to go over to
                    the chancery in the morning at the same time the other people arrived. Tim said,
                    “This is ridiculous. Most of the other people who work in the embassy go home at
                    six o'clock and put their feet up, that's when you get dressed to go out. Your
                    day doesn't end till midnight. It's ridiculous for you to think you have to come
                    in at nine o'clock.”</p>
                <p>So that was really a help. Then I could talk to Susan Miller and then Lorna about
                    the menu before going to my office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thinking along those lines, what role does the family of
                        an ambassador play? It's quite different if a man has a wife and she handles
                        the house; then he can concentrate his energies on the chancery. In your
                        case, you were both, so to speak, so you had people to help you in the home.
                        Did your family play any sort of a role? Did your children or husband pick
                        up on any of those things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: The children never lived there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They didn't? They just visited?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: They came in the summer and at Christmas and they loved it. It really
                    was a wonderful experience for them. They all loved it. Each Christmas, I would
                    say, “Do you want me to come back to Atlanta?” They would say, no, they'd prefer
                    to come to Belgium. My husband was very good at social things but he was quite
                    passive. He honestly didn't really help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really didn't get any help, any support, from your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That seems to be the way with so many of these women:
                        either they have no family or the family isn't able to help them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I have become friends with the Irwins in New York, Jack and Jane Irwin,
                    and when he was our ambassador in Paris, he was a widower. Now, of course, he is
                    married to Jane, and I said to her, “Oh, how sad for him that you weren't there
                    to help him.” He says, too, what a difference it would have made. She's a very
                    sparkly little Texas lady, and she said, “Plus, I would have loved it so.” It
                    would be, I would think, very difficult for a man ambassador without a wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, equally difficult for a woman, but women are more
                        used to handling these things. It's a full time job for an ambassadress
                        (Ambassadress—the wife of an ambassador, not a woman ambassador.). It really
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: One thing, an ambassadress can go to more tea parties and things like
                    that. I know they have the time for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's their role, of course. There is one dimension of
                        overseas life for the staff that is not accomplished, if there is no wife of
                        an ambassador, and that is the role that the wife plays in the American
                        women's organizations or the local women's clubs. Sometimes the DCM's wife
                        is able to do it, but more and more DCM's wives work also.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I know that Ciela Olsen enjoyed that with the American Women's
                    Club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she? So, in a sense, she took care of that part of it
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. She did like that. I always had a Christmas party for all the
                    children; that's when Larry Russell was Santa Claus. The first year Gian-Carlo
                    made these beautiful dainty little cookies, and Tim or Dane Towell told me after
                    that that the American kids didn't like those. The next Christmas they asked if
                    the mothers could bring brownies and chocolate-chip cookies. They were very
                    cute, and it became sort of a festivity for the mothers, and they would spend
                    two days decorating and they'd all bring the cookies. They'd come the day
                    before, and we'd have just sandwiches for them, but it became an annual
                    event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How nice. Well, your staff still speaks of your parties
                        and the fact that you invited every body. It really meant a great deal to
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Once every child had been picked up and this one little boy was left,
                    and he was looking very forlorn when his father finally picked him up. They had
                    been in Belgium quite a while. The father asked, “Oh, did you have a good time?”
                    And he said, “No, nobody there but a lot of American kids.” The father said, “I
                    realized it was time to go back to Washington.”Q: You entertained your locals,
                    too, didn't you?</p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had everybody, so nobody was left out, including
                        communicators, who so often get overlooked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I know. Then we'd send them cookies if there was something, and then
                    the marines, as I told you, on holidays, because I really was appalled to hear
                    that they had no cook on every holiday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when you finished and came back, did you find
                        difficulty getting back to an ordinary life in America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Before I came back, some months before I came back, a couple of
                    people from our art museum came and said they were starting a huge
                    fund-raisingto build the new museum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The High Museum [in Atlanta]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. And now we have the new one. Richard Maier is the architect. I was
                    asked if I would head that up, and I decided to say yes, because I felt that it
                    would be a let-down to come back. That really occupied me for, oh, I guess, nine
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a decompression chamber to go into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Then, you know, I had my house in France by that time. The first summer
                    was when Roberto Goizueta, who is chairman of Coca Cola, had been working on
                    that fundraising, so when I left for the summer, I thought everything was pretty
                    well done and organized. I had a phone call one day saying Mr. Goizueta wanted
                    to speak to me. I thought it was something about that, and so I said, “Has
                    something gone wrong? What's going on?”</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>He said no; he wanted to ask when I was coming back to Atlanta. I said, not for a
                    month or so. And he said, “Oh, dear, I'm sorry. I had something I wanted to ask
                    you in person, but I guess I'll have to do it on the phone.” That's when he
                    asked if I'd become a director of the Coca Cola company.</p>
                <p>My sister and brother-in-law were worried about me coming back to Atlanta.
                    Atlanta is not like New York or Washington, but there's a lot more going on
                    there than I would say in most other American cities. Our governor, George
                    Busbee, went to Europe quite a few times, and to the Orient, bringing
                    businesses. We have the largest zipper factory in the world from Japan, and our
                    Mayor, Andy Young, who I supported since he first ran for Congress, is really
                    committed to making Atlanta more international. When anyone interesting comes, I
                    meet him or I'm asked to have him. So I feel lucky to live there.</p>
                <p>But I did decide, about two years ago, that I wanted an apartment in New York,
                    because I had been staying at the River Club for a long time and I realized that
                    I was spending more and more time there. I'm more and more so glad I have that.
                    When I told my sister, she said, “We're just surprised you didn't get one
                    before. We just felt that you would.” And, really, I can't say I couldn't stay
                    here. I like the New York part of my life.</p>
                <p>Well, for instance, last week—I'm now a member of the Council on Foreign
                    Relations, and there was a lunch last week for the new French Minister of
                    Culture. And so, again, it's all these reconnections. I'm going next week to the
                    French-American Foundation to hear Julia Child speak. Usually it's someone from
                    the French government or a former ambassador, and so this is really going to be
                    fun, but there's just all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really keeps you on your toes. Looking back, can you
                        think of anything you wish you had done differently as an ambassador? Or
                        earlier in your life, perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: What would I have done differently as an ambassador? I don't know. I'm
                    sure if you had asked me that when I just left, I would have thought of lots of
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing of any great substance, in other words?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No; I don't think so. I don't think I would have done less of the
                    things I did; I really don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your own mind, you are satisfied with your
                        performance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I think so.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you have, perhaps, gone into politics earlier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I can't imagine that. One thing, I believe very much in therapy and
                    counseling and I said to someone not long ago—well, I was talking to my son and
                    daughter-in-law—and I said, “I think you're so lucky that there are now people
                    to go to and talk.” I mean, there are marriage counselors, there are
                    psychologists. I said, “When I was your age, there were only psychiatrists, and
                    that was for people who were really, really off the deep end.” I really wonder
                    if I had grown up in this generation how different my life might have been.</p>
                <p>What would I have done differently in my life? As I said, I never had a goal or a
                    star. I was married when I was twenty. The war came along. I had children. I
                    mean, it just all rolled along. And then I became interested in supporting
                    political candidates, after my second marriage. When I first came to Atlanta I
                    worked in the Junior League. And I told you this: I think the only thing my
                    father was really proud of was when I was taken into the Peachtree Garden Club.
                    I was the only Yankee to become president. Well, the first Yankee.</p>
                <p>I think my life must have been so dull, but I enjoyed having young children. I
                    enjoyed all of those years. And my second marriage has really been a happy one
                    for a long time. So I think I have to agree with [my friend] Natasha that each
                    era of my life has been better than the one before. But now when I come back
                    here, I like to see my contemporaries, my first friends I had when we were all
                    twenty together, but as I said to my daughter, who lives here, “Oh, when I think
                    of their lives compared to mine.” Of course, they wouldn't like mine any more
                    than I would like theirs. They never have lived anywhere else, except maybe in
                    the war.</p>
                <p>What I wish I had done: I was very inhibited, maybe by nature and upbringing. I
                    feel that I was so inhibited. That I would have changed. Because now I've become
                    less and less so, and it's a more comfortable way to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any characteristics that women have that men do
                        not have, in your opinion, that makes women more effective as ambassadors in
                        certain ways?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, maybe more compassion in a certain way, as far as personalities
                    and thinking about families goes. Although my father had that to such a
                    degree—oh, goodness, he was always—he would meet the son of an employee who had
                    terrible teeth and he'd say, “Why haven't you had your teeth fixed?” And they'd
                    say, “We can't afford it.” So Daddy would pay to have the teeth done.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wondered if women perhaps “get away with” more than men?
                        They could ask the tough questions without threatening other people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they're not perceived as being as
                        threatening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: No; that's true I think. It's still almost a novelty for a woman to be
                    an ambassador, so I think we can get away, probably, with more. But I don't know
                    what qualities a man would not have. I think, in my case, the Belgians were
                    pleased that I did some things that men would like, such as the shooting,
                    because not many women in Belgium shoot. They were so pleased that I liked to do
                    that and that I could hit some birds. Of course, in that country, we'd go out on
                    a day like this. We would always have rubber boots and a cape, and whether it
                    was raining or not, you went shooting. But that was just the opposite of “being
                    feminine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. But also it was noteworthy because you are a
                        woman, so in a way it isn't the opposite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: That was a plus, but they would have been pleased if any man ambassador
                    liked it. Particularly, I guess, they were surprised. As Tim said, “You can
                    often learn more walking down a country road with another ambassador with a gun
                    over your shoulder than at a formal dinner or reception.”</p>
                <p>I remember when Margaret Thatcher was elected the first time. Someone said,
                    “Aren't you thrilled that there's a woman Prime Minister?” And I said, “Only if
                    she's a good one.” I don't think you should just say there should be twenty
                    women ambassadors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what do you consider to be the most significant
                        achievements in your life to date? Do you consider that being an ambassador
                        one of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Someone said something about becoming an ambassador and I said, “I
                    was just lucky that someone whom I had supported politically happened to become
                    president of the United States.” And Kathy, my younger daughter, said, “No, it
                    wasn't just luck. Everything that you've done from the time you were twenty has
                    all been one step after another: the Junior League, then the Foreward Arts, and
                    all that.” Well, I really hadn't thought of them that way.</p>
                <p>Another was being able to help Jimmy Carter. Certainly having been an ambassador;
                    it was just a wonderful experience. And it was, in a sense, luck, because if I
                    hadn't known the President, this never would have happened, but my life has been
                    significant.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I guess the fact that the companies that our father started have grown and grown
                    and grown. My sister and I now are the only two of our generation, and my
                    brother-in-law does run the companies, so we had to make the decisions. We
                    didn't milk the companies; we really go to the other extreme. So I'm very proud
                    of those companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your brother-in-law handles them. Do you have any
                        input into them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, yes. I'm chairman of Atlanta Newspapers. We have to make decisions,
                    but he is the operator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. He's the day-to-day man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get back to where we started out. Since being an
                        ambassador, you are on the board of Coca Cola, which, you have said, would
                        not have happened before. I infer from that you find your opinions are more
                        valued than they were before you went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I feel that having been an ambassador has raised my stature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find that you are treated in a different way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given more respect, perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your opinions? Are they more listened to than
                        they used to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Oh, goodness! Maybe they're asked more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there is quite a bit of cachet, of power, surrounding
                        the title of ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. Again, as Don McHenry said, he and I were in luck. Well, I believe
                    so in timing in life, that things come along at certain times. Some people have
                    ill timing. Poor Hubert Humphrey; everything was badly timed. And I feel all
                    these things have come along at a time for me to take advantage. Certainly, for
                    anyone to be an ambassador does, I think, raise one's stature. I don't think all
                    ambassadors continue to be active. For instance, Philip Alston really has
                    retired to Sea Island, but he didn't have a family business. He wasn't a woman
                    just when the Coca Cola Company felt they wanted one. I think anyone, in any
                    profession, just being interested in varied experiences—brings great rewards.
                    Everything just leads to other wonderful and exciting things. As I say, I'm just
                    constantly surprised. I'm always feeling a bit like Cinderella.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your sister is not as active as you are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Not at all. She raises cattle and horses. But she's really never been
                    involved in supporting political candidates. We were so thrilled by our Senate
                    victory here in Georgia because Wyche Fowler, our new Senator, has been our
                    Congressman for quite a few years and he defeated the incumbent. As someone in
                    Washington said to me, not long ago, “It's disgraceful Georgia has the
                    reputation of having the finest Senator, Sam Nunn, and the worst. Wyche was
                    definitely the underdog and he won by 51-49 percent; so that was just
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly is. Are you still interested in the women's
                        movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, no, I would say I'm not. As I said, at that particular time, the
                    ERA was— I'm certainly interested in equality, but I'm not involved in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that women have made pretty good
                        progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: I do. I know a lot of people disagree. One thing that I just don't see
                    the need for, and some friends of mine do, is this museum in Washington for
                    women painters. A painter is a painter. I have tried to stay so far away; I have
                    been approached to give money and I just don't approve of it. I see no reason. I
                    think, as someone said, it's going backwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is, isn't it? Because the minute you say that you
                        have to be a woman to get in, you are categorizing; you are pulling them out
                        of the mainstream.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes. I mean, Rosa Bonheur—her paintings are supposed to come out of the
                    Louvre and go in a museum just with other women painters. As I say, that is
                    going backwards.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The daughter of Roberto Goizueta apparently has inherited her father's brilliance
                    and drive, and someone was complimenting her. She's a lawyer. He was beaming
                    like a proud father and said, “Yes, yes; that's true.” And I said, “Now, where
                    did she get all that? Just teasing him. And he said, “Oh, too bad she's not a
                    man.” I said, “Roberto, she doesn't have to be a man in 1986.” And I really feel
                    that way.</p>
                <p>I think women, not only women ambassadors, we're like Avis, we have to try harder
                    to prove ourselves. I do think that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At our first meeting, you spoke to me of the four men who
                        had been very important and instrumental in your life: Do you want to
                        elaborate on that? We didn't go into it that at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Well, my father, I guess, the things he believed in, the way he lived
                    his life. Would I have been as interested in politics—who knows? And yet, he
                    never said, “You should do that.” I mean, never. Was it osmosis? He required, I
                    think, a great deal of us. I remember him saying when I was really a little girl
                    that if I failed a grade in school, it would be a disgrace to the family. And
                    yet that didn't bother my sister at all. She was always totally uninhibited, so
                    it had to be my nature to an extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the point you are making was that men were your
                        examples, rather than women. You mentioned Carter and, I believe, the man
                        who taught you to shoot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes; that's right. I feel Jimmy Carter changed my life by making me an
                    ambassador. My life has been completely different. And then Fred Palmer, who—I
                    said to someone after he died, “He did far more than just teach me to shoot. In
                    a strange way, he gave me a self-confidence I never had before.” And when I told
                    my friend this—he had known and loved Fred as I did—he said, “I'm so glad you
                    realize that, because I've known it for a long time.”</p>
                <p>And then a friend whom I met who had been in Provence before I. He died a year
                    ago; his name was Rory Cameron. I'd heard his name for years and I loved
                    everything I ever heard about him. I never thought, not only that I would meet
                    him, but that we would become the greatest of friends. When I say that I think
                    I've learned more from him than anyone, and people ask how. Not only because he
                    was such a gardener, and what he did to his houses was so wonderful; his whole
                    philosophy and the way he lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He loved beauty, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, and in every way. He had a boyish enthusiasm. Someone said, “Well,
                    you learned about life.” I guess that's it. I think he changed my taste. I used
                    to say he poisoned my mind about something and then I would think, oh, dear,
                    that's terrible. But just the fun I had with him, really. I just felt I had more
                    rapport with him than either of my husbands. About readings; we went on a trip
                    to Turkey; I mean just being with him. He certainly wasn't trying to teach me
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He worked with you on your Sutton Place apartment, didn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes, and he'd never done anybody's house. Yes. He did a few things here
                    in Atlanta, but then he got sick. No; my apartment is really a hundred percent
                    Rory. Again, we had such fun going to London and going to Paris and, again, I
                    learned so much. I'd say, “Well, now, Rory, do you like that? What about that?”
                    He'd say, “Yes, but it's just not quite good enough.” And that, I have thought
                    so often of that expression with people in situations: “It's just not quite good
                    enough.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting how each one has given you another
                        dimension.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHAMBERS: It's been wonderful.</p>
                <p>(addendum by Mrs. Chambers - July 1987)</p>
                <p>Jim Lowenstein and I both serve now on the Board of Trustees of the La Cost�
                    School of the Arts in France, so I see him often. A couple of weeks ago, Ann and
                    Bernie Rogers and Tap and Margaret Bennett dined with me in New York. I serve on
                    the Board of the American Ditchley Foundation, of which Cy Vance is Chairman, so
                    that the reconnecting continues. And now my family and I spend Christmas in the
                    countryside of Provence rather than the Belgian countryside.</p>
