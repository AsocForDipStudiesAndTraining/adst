                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is September 23, 1998. This is an interview with
                        Laurence H. Silberman, Judge. We're doing this on behalf of the Association
                        for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Judge,
                        could we start...could you tell me when and where you were born and a bit
                        about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I was born October 12, 1935, in York, Pennsylvania. I left there after
                    only nine months because my older brother of five was killed in an automobile
                    accident and my parents, I think, wished to get away from York, and we moved to
                    Philadelphia. What would you like to know about my family?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to know what your father was doing, and your
                        mother's interests, and maybe where you grew up in Philadelphia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, actually I lived in Philadelphia for, I think, four years, and
                    then we moved to southern New Jersey, just south of Atlantic City, to Ventnor. I
                    think after kindergarten, in 1940, and I grew up in Ventnor, New Jersey, until I
                    went away to boarding school in 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's occupation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: My father was basically a ne'er do well, who was “retired.” He was a
                    spoiled son of a very wealthy and successful grandfather. My mother and father
                    divorced when I was nine years old. So, my father dabbled in a number of things,
                    but I don't think anything very seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: My mother was a rather hard-driving and competent person who, after my
                    mother and father divorced, went into the real estate business, did quite well,
                    until she married my stepfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was growing up in Ventnor like? I mean, Ventnor, to
                        me, of course, means something on the Monopoly board, which for those who
                        are not familiar with it is a game. But, what was being a young lad in
                        Ventnor like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, one thing I can recall is that when World War Two broke out, I
                    was made a block captain with the responsibility for keeping children quiet (I
                    think I was five or six.) while their parents slept after war work. It's clear
                    to me in hindsight that I was selected because I was the noisiest child.</p>
                <p>It's hard to begin to tell you what it was like growing up in Ventnor, New
                    Jersey. It is a small town suburb of Atlantic City; very flat, with many of the
                    homes owned by people who came down for the summer, in those days from New York,
                    Philadelphia, or Washington, but I'd say the majority were owned by people who
                    lived there, who often fell into the category of people who retired and some who
                    had occupations in the surrounding area, particularly in Atlantic City. It was a
                    town of about six or seven thousand people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, before you went away to boarding school, what about
                        the...were there any teachers, or any subjects that particularly interested
                        you? What did you do to keep yourself busy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I think...when I think back to my childhood I loved athletics,
                    in particular, baseball; football, and basketball, as well. But most of all
                    baseball. And as far as school was concerned, I wasn't a distinguished student,
                    but I always read the history books given in every class, in the first week or
                    two. The entire book. Almost as if it were a novel. And I did a lot of reading
                    on my own, concerning history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into the Henty books, and some of the sort of
                        adventure history books?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I remember particularly...I don't remember Henty, but I do remember
                    one series that I've been trying to find for my grandsons, written by a fellow
                    by the name of Joseph Altsheler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Indians...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, Civil war.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Civil war, but also I think he did something on Indians,
                        if I recall...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Perhaps he did. He had a whole series which dealt with every battle of
                    the Civil War, each one was a separate novel in which the characters were young
                    men in either the Confederate or the Union Army. I also remember from my very
                    earliest reading days, reading early books about World War Two, a series with
                    Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer. Dave Dawson was an American and I think Freddy
                    Farmer, a Brit, and they were pilots in WWII. So, I must have been six or seven
                    years old when I was reading those kind of books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they're a wonderful series. I know most of those.
                        Well, then you went away to boarding school, how old were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I believe I was 15.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to boarding school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: A school that I think is now defunct. Croyden Hall Academy in Redbank,
                    New Jersey. I was an indifferent student in high school, and my mother after
                    having me tested decided she should send me off to boarding school. My father
                    had gone to Mercersburg Academy and she wanted me to go to Lawrenceville, and
                    Lawrenceville accepted me only under the condition that I would drop back a
                    year. I was rather young...but I stubbornly refused and so I went off to this
                    somewhat marginal prep school that someone had recommended to us and where I
                    stayed for my junior and senior years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this act on your academic interests and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I did well there. I think I finished first both years, but it
                    was a small school. It wasn't that challenging. They had sent one boy the year
                    or two before I arrived to Dartmouth, which I think was the first student they
                    had sent to a good Ivy League school. The trustees wanted me to go to Princeton,
                    I think in part because they wanted to spread their reputation, but I didn't
                    want to stay that close to home, so I applied to Dartmouth and I went there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Croydon Hall when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: 1953. I graduated in May or June of the year that the Korean War
                    ended.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were quite young at the time, but were you caught up
                        in World War II other than trying to keep the people quiet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Oh, yes. World War II is by far and away the single most important
                    event of my life, even though I was only six when it started and not yet ten
                    when it ended. It dominated my thinking- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I was telling you that I have had reason to think and for some
                    time realize that is to say, that World War II had such an enormous impact on
                    me. Actually, one of my earliest memories precedes World War Two, at least our
                    entry into it, and it involves an uncle of mine while we still lived in
                    Philadelphia. He explained to me on the floor of his living room, with maps
                    before him, the progress of the Russo-Finnish War of 1939 and I remember at that
                    time having enormous admiration for the plucky Finns. I was only four then, I
                    think. I do recall distinctly Pearl Harbor. I remember it almost as if it were
                    yesterday. All the men in Ventnor, right after the war started, were assigned a
                    rifle or some kind of gun, in Ventnor City Hall, because there was a, now it
                    seems an almost incredible, concern, that the Germans would invade on the South
                    Jersey beaches. Of course, if the Germans had the capacity to invade the United
                    States, that would have been the logical place to invade. But, the notion of
                    course was absurd. However, after Pearl Harbor there was a good deal of
                    irrational fear and as I said each man had a rifle or some gun assigned to him
                    at Ventnor City Hall, in case of an emergency, and one woman, my mother, who was
                    a crack shot and a great athlete and insisted that she have a gun, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am a little older than you and I was an aircraft spotter
                        waiting for the Luftwaffe to attack Annapolis, which somehow they never got
                        around to doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, of course not. I do remember some events of World War II. I
                    remember vividly that in the summer of 1942 you could not swim on the beaches in
                    Ventnor because there was so much oil from sunk tankers and occasionally
                    unpleasant flotsam floated in, perhaps even bodies. One of my dear friends had a
                    cousin, as I recall, killed when his ship was torpedoed only a mile or so
                    offshore- I recall that my friends and I used to sneak on the top of [the] roof
                    on my house and look out at the horizon with binoculars. You weren't allowed to
                    have binoculars and I think it was almost illegal to look at the horizon,
                    perhaps flatly illegal to look at the horizon with binoculars, but we would
                    sneak up there and look and I can recall vividly that you would see a solid line
                    of ships on the horizon. Different distances but looking at it with binoculars
                    it would appear as if there was a solid line of ships. There were so many ships
                    forming up their convoys. Sometime in '43, I actually saw Navy planes attack a
                    German submarine, that somehow had surfaced perhaps because of an engine
                    malfunction, not too far offshore. So, I actually saw elements of the war, small
                    bits, of course, but I followed very carefully every battle in the Pacific and
                    Europe, both in the movie news and I think I was even reading the papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a great geography lesson, particularly for young
                        boys at that era. You certainly learned a lot of names and places. You said
                        this had an impact on you later on. Is this a feeling of international
                        responsibility, how would you say it's affected you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: First of all, my uncles and cousins - not my father, who was a little
                    old - were in the war, so I detected concern in my relatives. My grandfather had
                    2 grandsons flying on B-17s out of England and now that I am a grandfather I
                    have a sense of how terrifying that must have been. One of them was shot down
                    and captured. So, emotionally that has an enormous impact on a young boy. And of
                    course since I loved history anyway, it did probably do a lot to kindle my views
                    or my interest in international affairs and my concern for the United States'
                    role in international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you in 1950 when the Korean War started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Let's see. I entered prep school at the age of 15 for my junior year
                    and graduated when I was 17. It actually would have been just before I was 15,
                    and I was 15 in 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Korean war, did that have a similar effect, or was
                        that something far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I somehow don't think of the Korean War as having quite a seminal
                    impact on me. I think in that respect I was similar to most Americans. World War
                    II was a Manichean struggle. Not that I wasn't, as far as I can recall my views,
                    sympathetic to the Administration's fighting of the war and was rather
                    disappointed in the inconclusive outcome, balanced, of course, with the natural
                    feeling that I avoided going to war.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking when I had turned 17, in October of my last year in prep
                    school, I remember thinking a lot about the fact that I could drop out of prep
                    school and volunteer for the army or the marines and feeling a little guilty
                    that I didn't do so - but not so guilty that I was going to drop out of prep
                    school. I knew I had to finish in order to go on to college. But I had a twinge
                    of guilt. By the time I did graduate, the war was over.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you picked Dartmouth. Was there anybody pushing
                        you towards Dartmouth, or was this on your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, actually, it's sort of an interesting billiard shot. My
                    grandfather had a particularly high regard for Harvard Law School, my
                    grandfather.I don't know why he had such a high regard for Harvard Law School,
                    but he did. So I think very early on, I wanted to go to Harvard Law School. And
                    there were reasons why I came to like the idea very much, too. So therefore, I
                    did not want to go to Harvard College, and I wanted to go somewhere where
                    there'd be a contrast to the law school. Dartmouth and Princeton seemed to be
                    the most logical, and as I told you, I didn't want to go to Princeton because it
                    was too close to home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was thinking of Dartmouth as being off in the

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, I don't think that necessarily follows at all, actually. I mean, I
                    did love the country, northern New England, but Dartmouth probably had a very
                    strong masculine image then, and to a certain extent still now, more of a
                    problem with coeducation than some of the other schools.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, of course, and a very rigorously male atmosphere, which, to tell
                    the truth, I liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the course you were taking there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I majored in history, not surprisingly, and I also took courses in
                    government. I was particularly influenced by two professors there. One was an
                    expert on biography and a political scientist by the name of Arthur Wilson. And
                    the second was a history professor by the name of John Adams. It turns out, and
                    I only found this out recently, John Adams was a Serb. Adams was an
                    Americanization of Adamovic, and John Adams taught modern history as well as
                    history of the Balkans. I think I took both, and he inculcated in me a
                    fascination with the Balkans, and particularly the Serbs. He once said, and I
                    have never forgotten it, the Serbs were the greatest people in Europe because
                    they could reduce the most complicated social, economic, and political questions
                    into a simple formula: nine grams in the back of the neck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adamovic - there's something coming. There was a historian
                        or a political figure or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think he changed his name a long time before. In fact, we didn't
                    even know then that his name had been changed from Adamovic or that he was
                    originally of Serbian origin. I was not totally surprised, however, because he
                    was so fascinating and fascinated with the Balkans and the Serbs. But he was not
                    by any means a blind Serbophile. At any event, he obviously had a profound
                    influence on me and generated a fascination for the Balkans.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I think I read widely. How much beyond the assigned courses I
                    read I don't recall, but I did read widely in history and political science or
                    government affairs (I always hated the term political science.). The only thing
                    that I did not study or read about, which I subsequently regretted, was
                    economics. I had to teach myself economics after I graduated from law
                    school.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was law sort of uppermost in your mind as-SILBERMAN: I
                        never had any doubt that I was going to be a lawyer. From the earliest age
                        that I can recall thinking about my occupation, it was to be a lawyer. It
                        could well have come from my grandfather, which is a little strange, in a
                        way. My grandfather was one of the founders of a very successful corporation
                        that became a national monopoly in scrap iron and steel in the '20s and '30s
                        called Luria Brothers, which is now part of Ogden Corporation and has
                        largely disappeared as a separate company. But in the '40s and '50s, it was
                        a target of the FTC for monopolization of the business of brokerage of scrap
                        iron and steel in the United States. All of his brothers-in-law, who were
                        partners of his, and his sons became businessmen and went into the corporate
                        business, with the exception of my father, who, as I said, was something of
                        a playboy. But none of them went to graduate school, beyond college. Indeed,
                        it was discouraged. One cousin wanted to be a doctor. He graduated from
                        Yale, but they wouldn't let him. Everybody was encouraged to go into
                        business. On the other hand, my grandfather may well have encouraged his
                        daughters to marry very smart young lawyers who weren't very affluent and
                        gave them big dowries. So my grandfather had a very healthy respect for a
                        legal education and for lawyers, and he subsequently helped to turn over the
                        business to one of my uncles who was a lawyer. So, my grandfather may well
                        have, early on, introduced the notion of being a lawyer to me, but I think I
                        always saw myself as a lawyer, even as a small child.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, pre-law is. . . . not really. Nowhere is there such a thing as a
                    pre-law course. When I got to Harvard law school, the majority of students there
                    had been either history majors, government majors, or economic majors; but there
                    were many who had been science majors or math majors as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I have to confess, I have a blot on my escutcheon because I was
                    suspended from Dartmouth my sophomore year for a semester, the second semester
                    of my sophomore year, allegedly for spending the night in a dormitory at what
                    was then an all-girl school (We said “girls” in those days.), Skidmore
                    College.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, in Saratoga Springs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That is correct. I was charged with conduct unbecoming a Dartmouth
                    gentleman. I recently gave a talk about that to a group of lawyers in Washington
                    in which I was describing the events at Yale. You may recall that five young
                    men, orthodox Jews, were suing Yale, trying to get out of the obligation of
                    living in a coed dormitory because they regarded it as contrary to their moral
                    and religious tenets. And I realized that there was this paradox that some, was
                    it, 40 years ago, I was thrown out of college for doing that which they were
                    being thrown out of college for not doing. So I should have defended on the
                    grounds that I was 40 years ahead of my time.</p>
                <p>But at any event, that had a double whammy impact on me of enormous significance,
                    the first of which is I had to go to Harvard College for two summers because it
                    was the only place I could go and get full credit for courses. That is to say,
                    if I got an A in a course at Harvard, it would count as an A at Dartmouth, but
                    the only college or university that they would do that for was Harvard. So I had
                    to go to Harvard Summer School for two summers if I was going to try to graduate
                    in my class, which I did. In the first summer, I met my wife, at a Harvard
                    dance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Skidmore seems to be pretty far afield from

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, actually, Dartmouth was sort of equidistant between Skidmore,
                    Smith, and Wellesley. And so I tended to go to all those places on weekends. My
                    wife, as it happened, was a Smithie.</p>

                        did politics intrude? I'm just thinking about either international or

                        involved or did that intrude in what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Intrude? Not at all. I did get involved. As a matter of fact, one of
                    my ex-clerks just recently told me he saw a yearbook of mine in college, and he
                    was rather amused to see that I was a member of the Republican Club, the
                    International Relations Club, and the Pre-Law Club, which tends to follow, or
                    presage, my career. I remember [the] dramatic events of 1956 when the Soviets
                    invaded Hungary almost at the same time that Israel, France, and Britain were
                    invading Egypt.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Fall of '56, which means it was my senior year. And I remember being
                    just absolutely consumed with the events, trying to follow everything at once,
                    walking over to my fraternity house, anxious to talk about it with somebody, and
                    being frustrated that my friends were playing bridge and not particularly
                    interested.</p>

                    studentship, and I traveled around Europe on my own. And I can recall a rather

                    of '53-</p>

                    who was anti-McCarthy, and it coincided with - you may recall, or at least,
                    1953, when I was there - the Berlin uprising had taken place. And so you had

                    one fierce anti-McCarthyite, and it ended up in a fist-fight that, as I recall,
                    involved a lot of people there. I was a strong anti-communist, but I also had
                    nothing but contempt and disdain for McCarthy and regarded then, as I do now,
                    McCarthy as being one of the great allies of communism because he often
                    discredited the anti-communist cause and even gave rise to an intellectual
                    phenomenon of the anti-anti-communist, which was great trouble for the United
                    States. Not ultimately, but at least it was a running sore, which gave rise to
                    such stupidity as the convergence theories.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Oh, you recall that, don't you? It was very popular in intellectual
                    circles from the '50's through the '80's, that the United States and the Soviet
                    Union were evolving along courses that would ultimately meet somewhere in the
                    middle, and it was a view that was very popular in academia and in large
                    segments of the Democratic Party, which wished to move in a more redistributive
                    socialist direction in the United States. I think it was a view that was
                    probably reflected by the present deputy secretary of state during his years as
                    a writer for Time Magazine.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I do recall at Dartmouth in the summer of '53, Eisenhower came and
                    spoke, in June, actually, at commencement, just before I arrived in that fall.
                    And it was that famous speech, the anti-McCarthy speech in which he said,
                    “Please, don't join the book-burners.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: It took Eisenhower a long time, I thought a little too long, to oppose
                    McCarthy, particularly since McCarthy attacked his mentor, George Marshall.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: But maybe Eisenhower was right to maneuver as he did, to isolate and
                    discredit McCarthy somewhat behind the scenes. In any event, it was a dramatic
                    moment. Now Dartmouth - you're asking about politics - Dartmouth was then and
                    probably still is today the most Republican-leaning of the Ivy League schools.
                    It was also the most egalitarian school. That is to say, it was very hard to
                    tell whether someone was a graduate of Exeter or a public high school in a big
                    city. There was more homogeneity than there is today, of course, but there was a
                    greater sense of equality than was true of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or
                    Williams, for that matter, in that the prep school graduates did not tend to
                    congregate together. And there wasn't as much effort to distinguish the preppies
                    from the non-preppies, as was true at other schools. So I always thought of it
                    as not paradoxical at all but it was the most conservative of the Ivy League
                    schools and also the most egalitarian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A phenomenon became up unto the present time but was there
                        developing there you might say the campus Marxist, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Sure, there were some, but less so than was true at other Ivy League
                    schools. Indeed, I seem to recall that in 1956 the Daily Dartmouth was the only
                    one of the Ivy League newspapers that supported Eisenhower over Stevenson, but
                    after all a few years before that Buckley had written God and Man at Yale, and
                    it was perfectly clear when I entered Dartmouth that the faculty tended strongly
                    towards the Democratic Party and was somewhat hostile to the Republican Party
                    and the conservative views - nowhere near as bad as it is today, but the trend
                    had already started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, even when I was at Williams - this was '46 to '50
                        - the faculty, I think, was more liberal than the student body. In my group
                        of veterans - I was not, but I think that the rather conservative student
                        body and rather liberal faculty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That was certainly true of Dartmouth then, although, again, no where
                    near as dramatic a gulf as exists today. I know more about that because my son,
                    daughter, and daughter-in-law all went to Dartmouth. But that had begun to
                    develop, and there was a rich contrast with Dartmouth or Yale or Williams back
                    in the '20s, when the faculty tended to be much more conservative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the - was it the International Relations Club I
                        guess it was called - IRC, was that it? Was there much sort of movement
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I don't recall. I joined it because I was interested in it, but I
                    don't remember much about the meetings. I was interested in international
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you graduated from Dartmouth in 1957, and
                        Harvard was the place to go, as far as you were concerned, Harvard Law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, one of my professors, who I mentioned earlier, Arthur Wilson,
                    strongly urged me to go instead to Yale Law School. The non-lawyer faculty
                    members always preferred Yale because it was less law-drenched than Harvard; it
                    was more law-and-other-things - sociology, economics, whatever. And after I was
                    accepted to both, I thought long and hard about it, but I guess - my wife says -
                    there was never any question that I'd end up at Harvard Law School. It was a
                    very special place for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's interesting to look at the relationship because
                        both Yale and Harvard have been producing lawyers for some eons practically,
                        and at your time, when you went in '57, did you see a different type of
                        lawyer? Was this the perception - a different type of lawyer was coming out
                        of Yale than was coming out of Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, first of all, let me correct you. I didn't enter Law School in
                    '57. It was not until 1958. I had one year in the army - actually six months
                    active duty. The Reserve Forces Act of 1955 had provided an opportunity to
                    enlist for six months and then serve five and a half years in reserve, so you
                    didn't have to face a two-year draft possibility, and I hated the idea of having
                    a draft hanging over my head. I preferred to enlist. I tried to get into navy,
                    air force, or marine ROTC at Dartmouth, but they wouldn't take me because of my
                    eyes, and I remember looking at the army and thinking, Well, the hell with it.
                    And so I went in as an enlisted man in '57.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: At Fort Dix, New Jersey, for basic training, and then they sent me to
                    a clerk-typist school, which was a disaster since I had broken all my fingers
                    playing baseball. And I graduated from a class, I think it was 160th, having
                    achieved eight words per minute! The old typewriters were hard. Anyway, then the
                    next year, the next fall, I entered Harvard Law School. Now the choice between
                    Harvard and Yale was an interesting one in those days. I just finished teaching
                    a course at Harvard Law School last spring, the 40th anniversary of the year I
                    entered. The contrast between the two schools was quite dramatic and vivid.
                    Harvard prided itself on being the school for lawyers who wanted to practice
                    law, whereas Yale almost offered itself up as a school for people who wanted a
                    law degree but weren't actually sure whether they wanted to be lawyers or
                    philosophers or businessmen or whatever. Secondly, Harvard very much cherished
                    the tradition of Oliver Wendell Holmes and Felix Frankfurter, a tradition in
                    which the law had a certain inherent integrity as an intellectual discipline and
                    also stood for notions of judicial restraint, as opposed to judicial policy
                    making. Yale, having pioneered the critical legal study . . . no, not the
                    critical legal study. That's a modern version. God, I can't remember what it
                    used to be called in those days. Oh, “legal realism” in the '20s and '30s. It
                    was more cynical about law, which fit, I suppose, its tradition of being the
                    school of law and - whatever. So for a whole host of reasons, after having
                    visited both places and attended classes in both places, I found Harvard much
                    more fitting my framework.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were at Harvard Law then, this would be '58 to '61.
                        I've seen the movie and read the book The Paper Chase. Was that Harvard in
                        your time, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: It's hyperbole. It's grossly exaggerated. But it was certainly true
                    that at Harvard Law School students were put through intellectual basic
                    training, and professors were quite rigorous and could be tough in the use of
                    the Socratic method. You were expected to be able to stand on your feet in
                    response to a somewhat withering line of questioning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find you responded initially to this? Were you
                        ready for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I loved Harvard Law School. I thought it was the most intellectually
                    exciting academic experience I have ever had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you moved on, did you concentrate in any particular
                        field of law, or did one keep pretty general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, in those days your first two years' courses were pretty much
                    required. There was a little bit of selection in the second year and much more
                    in the third year. I tended to stay away from anything that focused on numbers.
                    I told you about avoiding economics at Dartmouth. One of the reasons I wanted to
                    go to Dartmouth rather than Princeton was that Princeton required math in your
                    first year, and I was terrified of math courses. I had a very bad experience in
                    grade school, and so even by law school I was still trying to avoid anything
                    with math. As I said, I taught myself economics after I got out of law school,
                    and at one point, actually as an executive vice-president of a bank, had the
                    economics department reporting to me, so I've come to love economics and realize
                    that you don't have to know how to count in order to understand economics.</p>
                <p>But still in law school I was trying to avoid anything with numbers, so I tried
                    to stay away from the corporate finance and tax area, and I was drawn to both
                    anti-trust and labor, partly because both anti-trust and labor reminded me,
                    interestingly enough, of international affairs. In labor relations you had this
                    model, this contrast of political power on the part of the trade unions versus
                    the employers which reminded me very much of my interest in international
                    relations, and to a certain extent that was true in anti-trust as well, where
                    you had a struggle in the marketplace between the major competitors against
                    sometimes less well-endowed competitors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself, as you were dealing
                        particularly in the labor and anti-trust field, your own political
                        philosophy? Was this coming out, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, actually, I'd always been... First of all, I came from a
                    uniformly Republican family. My grandfather, who had the greatest influence on
                    me growing up, as you've already detected, despised Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “That man in the White House”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I don't recall he used that particular phrase, but you may recall
                    I've described earlier that the FTC had proceeded against my grandfather's
                    corporation, which did not endear Roosevelt to him. But beyond that they were
                    solid Republicans. My grandfather had given money, however, to Roosevelt in 1932
                    because Roosevelt ran to the right of Hoover, and he felt betrayed, so he really
                    despised Roosevelt, and I wasn't allowed to mention his name. Actually, I came
                    to have great admiration for Roosevelt, certainly his foreign policy, as I got
                    older. But anyway, I came from a solid Republican family, so in the era I tended
                    to look at... I was drawn into labor law, interestingly enough, partly for quasi
                    political reasons. And when I left... Well, I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
                <p>Derek Bok was a young professor of mine. He taught me both labor and anti-trust
                    and had a great influence on me. He arranged for me to clerk for a federal judge
                    right after my third year, a judge in Newark, a federal district judge, who was
                    a famous ex-labor lawyer. Then I was going to come down to a law firm in
                    Washington the following year. Unfortunately for me, the judge died in May. At
                    the end of my last year in law school I had two children and I was thunderstruck
                    as to what I was going to do to feed my family for a year. My parents had
                    supported me through law school, but it was certainly time for me to earn my own
                    money. But Derek arranged at the last moment for me to go to Hawaii to practice
                    law, at least for a while, at a Hawaii law firm that was full of Harvard people,
                    I did that, stayed there, became a partner, loved Hawaii, and came back seven
                    years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still on the Harvard side, how would you characterize the
                        people at Harvard at the law school in your period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: The people - my classmates?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: My classmates were an extraordinary group of men, for the most part -
                    there were only a few women. Again, I thought them the most interesting people I
                    had ever encountered. I think I was a bit frustrated with Dartmouth because of
                    something of an anti-intellectual atmosphere. On the other hand, I was put off
                    by the exaggerated pseudo-intellectualism of certain schools. Harvard College
                    had something of that atmosphere. Well, Harvard Law School, however, seemed to
                    attract people with a blend that I appreciated - first class minds many of whom
                    were socially adept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did politics intrude there at all, or were you a world
                        apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Were we conscious of politics? Of course we were. Lawyers tend to have
                    political blood running in their veins. I sometimes thought that every single
                    member of my class's secret ambition was to be made President of the United
                    States somehow miraculously. I recall that there was a poll taken in 1960 of
                    students and faculty at both the law school and the business school with respect
                    to the Presidential election coming up, and keep in mind that Jack Kennedy was a
                    Harvardian with enormous charm and a charm that was particularly understandable
                    to us Ivy Leaguers. Nixon was personally off-putting to Harvardians. Yet the
                    poll revealed that 40 per cent of the student body at the law school was for
                    Nixon and 60 per cent for Kennedy, and the faculty was roughly the same
                    proportion. If you were to take the present Harvard Law School, move them back
                    into 1960, do the same poll, the students would be something like 80-20 for
                    Kennedy, and the faculty would be - if you found anybody who would be for Nixon,
                    it would be a surprise.</p>
                <p>I recall I was a member of the Republican Club at the law school, and I remember
                    Barry Goldwater coming up and speaking to us and having lunch with us, and I
                    came away with the view - that he expressed, interestingly, enough - that he
                    didn't think he was smart enough to be President of the United States. And I
                    thought he was probably right, and that's before I realized that character was
                    more important than brains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were dealing with-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: When you said, “Did politics intrude,” did you mean were there
                    spirited kinds of arguments between students?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, not really. I never recall any divisive conversations about
                    politics at law school. We did occasionally have some arguments - there were a
                    number of southerners - about the right approach to integration. And I remember
                    being involved, I was a member of a club there called the Lincoln's Inn, a
                    social club, and I can remember being enlisted in a bit of a struggle to get our
                    southern friends and classmates to agree to allow us to take in a black who was
                    the son of, I think, as I recall, a Nigerian foreign minister. Now, any
                    southerner who was at the Harvard Law School was almost per se a liberal on
                    racial relations, or he wouldn't have been there, but many of them were
                    interested in a political career, and they were afraid of the downside of being
                    in a club with a black. One of the ways I was able to convince a number of them
                    to withdraw any opposition was to explain that by the time they ran for office
                    it would be an advantage.</p>

                        time. I mean, it was right on the cusp of a massive change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: You're absolutely right. In 1960, when the judge died and I ended up
                    going to Hawaii, I remember distinctly talking with my wife about the advantages
                    of getting out of the continental United States and going to a multi-racial
                    society where our children could grow up with more of an awareness of what was
                    thought to be, today called, “diversity.” We distinctly regarded it as an
                    advantage to get out, to go to Hawaii when the South was coming apart. It seemed
                    like the country was coming apart over racial relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, coming from a Republican background, the law
                        as regards both labor and anti-trust - both of which have strong political
                        reverberations - did you find yourself sort of coming at that from a
                        political point of view, or were you able to see this as a legal
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, of course I could see it as a legal problem, but I think the
                    fact that I was interested in labor law was not unrelated to my political
                    viewpoints. Generally, people were drawn into labor law, a least in those days,
                    because they were either very sympathetic or somewhat unsympathetic to trade
                    unions. My stepfather had been president of a hotel association in Atlantic
                    City, and I recall vividly a strike which had elements of violence in it, a
                    strike that he faced, as the president of the association, as one of the hotel
                    owners, and I'm sure that had an impact on me. I was not sympathetic to trade
                    unions at that point. Interestingly enough, after practicing in the area for
                    eight years and having gone to the Labor Department, I became much more
                    sympathetic to trade unions, but it's probably true that I was drawn into that
                    area for several reasons. Number one, I told you, it reminded me of the
                    confluence of power, of my interest in international affairs. Secondly, it had a
                    strong political element. And third, it didn't require me, in those days, to get
                    into numerical questions such as corporate finance, because it had more of a
                    political model than an economic model, and I was more interested in politics
                    than economics in those days.</p>
                <p>Anti-trust I was less interested in than labor, but I was still interested. It
                    had a blend of political and economic in it. In modern times, anti-trust has
                    been thought of as not a political model at all because, as you may or may not
                    know, legal scholars have determined, and the Supreme Court has ultimately
                    accepted the notion, that the anti-trust laws should be interpreted only in
                    economic terms, not in political terms, and therefore notions such as “big
                    corporations have too much political power as opposed to little corporations”
                    have no longer been accepted as a legitimate part of the anti-trust laws.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was very much part of the New Deal tendency,

                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: True, true, you're right. In my day, anti-trust had both a political
                    and an economic element. I didn't have the same instinctive allegiance with the
                    large company versus small as I did on the labor field with management rather
                    than unions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, something that just occurred to me that we
                        haven't talked about there, and this is a foreign affairs thing,
                        international law. I mean was this even a course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Ah, very good question. I was most interested in taking a course in
                    international law. That was a blend of the two areas that I was most interested
                    in, exactly. I remember going to Professor Katz, who was one of the major
                    figures of the Marshall Plan, and asking him about international law, and he
                    advised me to take a course in international transactions, which was basically a
                    commercial law course that taught you that if you were doing business in a
                    foreign country you needed to get a foreign lawyer. He advised me against taking
                    any courses in public international law, explaining that it was a field that was
                    not of major significance as either law or international affairs. And of course
                    that's still true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know as a retired Foreign Service officer most of my
                        contemporaries, colleagues, from other countries have taken a lot of
                        international law, and I've searched my time and found that really
                        international law doesn't play that much of a thing in diplomacy. If you
                        have to know about it, you hire somebody to help you. At least that's my
                        prejudice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: It plays a virtually insignificant role in international affairs,
                    although Americans, interestingly enough, have always tended to put more
                    influence on law than foreigners even though the foreigners study it. For
                    instance, we end up with secretaries of state who are lawyers and who tend to
                    think in terms of international law much more than its inherent importance
                    suggests or really justifies. Even - I won't get into present politics - I
                    reached the conclusion after talking to Professor Katz that it would be a waste
                    of time to study international law. And I was rather surprised because I thought
                    that would be interesting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Of course, you know, as an ex-Foreign Service officer, L, the legal
                    affairs section of the State Department, is an area with very little real
                    influence. In fact, I can tell you that amongst the departments of government,
                    that department where the general counsel is the least important in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me, L has always been the place where you refer
                        something if you want to delay it. Otherwise, you try to keep it away from
                        L.</hi>

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Exactly. Well, Professor Katz explained basically that point to me
                    back in 1959, and so I did not take a course in public international law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went to Hawaii, and you were there from '61

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: It just became a state in '59. It was very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to touch on this, but what firm were you with,
                        and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I originally went out as an associate, and then I became a
                    partner in only a few years. And the firm was originally Moore, Torkildson,
                    Rice; then it was Moore, Silberman, Schultz. And I practiced almost entirely
                    labor law for management, although I did some other ancillary litigation work.
                    Labor law included a good deal of litigation itself. In the summer of '67, the
                    bar convention was held in Honolulu, and the deputy general counsel of the NLRB,
                    the National Labor Relations Board, came to my house for dinner and they put the
                    notion in my mind that I might spend some time working for them arguing
                    appellate cases in the courts of appeal. I had argued several against them and
                    won, and I felt a sense of a gap in my background because I hadn't spent any
                    time in government, as so many of my classmates had, and it seemed that it might
                    be a good idea to go to work as a neutral for the National Labor Relations Board
                    and argue cases. So we moved back here to Washington. I don't think I intended
                    to do it for more than a year or two, but I was there for a little more than a
                    year when Nixon won the election, and then all of a sudden I became a much more
                    valuable commodity than I could ever have imagined because I was a Republican
                    labor lawyer who had been a partner in a management firm and had spent a little
                    more than a year as a neutral taking a neutral rinse. So to my surprise - I was
                    interested in going into the administration - I was selected for the solicitor
                    of the Labor Department, which was a much higher position than I would have ever
                    dreamed of getting only a few months before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to touch a bit on labor law in Hawaii. My
                        impression of Hawaii is that particularly because it's a place that lives
                        and dies on exports-imports and the longshoremen and all that that labor is
                        a very important element in the society, as opposed to, say, Kansas or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: You are very shrewd. You're quite right. Hawaii was, when I arrived
                    there in 1961, one of the most organized states in the Union and rather
                    unique-Q: You say “organized,” you mean union organized.</p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes. That's the term they used - one of the most organized states
                    meaning union organized. And unique in some respects in that the agriculture,
                    pineapple and sugar, were organized by the ILWU as well as longshore, and they
                    were fighting with the Teamsters, the Hotel Workers-Teamsters, for
                    representation in the growing hotel business. The ILWU in those days - maybe
                    it's still true today - in those days had a strong leftist influence. Also,
                    however, they were rather clean, straight, as opposed to the ILA in the East,
                    that had a strong anti-communist orientation but it was also corrupt. But in any
                    event, Hawaii was a fascinating place to practice labor law because labor
                    relations were so important to the state and there was such a dramatic
                    confrontation.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Always versus. Not surprisingly, I was involved in Republican Party
                    politics. I worked somewhat in Senator Fong's campaign. Hiram Fong was a
                    Republican senator from Hawaii. However, one of my senior partners, who had been
                    the ex-governor of the state, Bill Quinn, who came into the firm when he left
                    the governorship and they changed the name to Quinn, Moore for a while; then it
                    became Moore, Silberman and Schultz. Bill was chairman of the Rockefeller
                    campaign in 1964, and he made me vice-chairman (or some title) of the campaign,
                    and I of course was enthusiastic about Rockefeller in no small part because of
                    the Dartmouth connection. Rockefeller was a little bit to the left of where I
                    was, but I was nevertheless infuriated when at the Cow Palace in 1964 he was
                    treated so shabbily by the Goldwater forces, and I ended up signing an ad for
                    Lyndon Johnson, the only Democrat I ever voted for, and for signing the ad I was
                    thrown out of the Young Republicans after the election.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Of course, when I went there, the Vietnam War... Well, the Vietnam War
                    really started occupying our consciousness in '64, '65, '66. By the end of '67
                    and early '68, when I left, it had achieved a dominant role in American
                    politics. I watched the war develop with a good deal of trepidation and concern.
                    I was discharged from the army reserve in '63. The war really didn't start until
                    '64 and '65, and by that time I was in my 30s and with three children.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, actually, when I was in the army, I volunteered at one point to go
                    into the paratroopers, but they wouldn't let me go in because I was only in for
                    six months - anything to get out of that typing. So I didn't think of it in
                    personal terms, because the war really didn't start till after I was discharged
                    from the army. But I watched it with a sinking feeling. I worried about it a
                    great deal. I disliked the anti-war movement in the United States intensely,
                    because I thought it was grounded on personal apprehension on the part of young
                    males more than anything else-</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: -and I regarded the notion that the war was immoral as itself
                    ridiculous. On the other hand, I did not ever think - I used to sit and look at
                    that map - I didn't see how we could ever win that war unless we were prepared
                    to invade North Vietnam. And so I worried a great deal about it, and I always
                    had something of a doomed feeling about it because I knew our strategy was
                    inherently flawed.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Not really. Actually, Hawaii was pro-war, Republican and Democrat. I

                    the Johnson rally, and we did get him off, having argued that his actions were
                    protected by the first amendment. But I didn't by any means agree with what he
                    did or generally agree with the ACLU. But the war was not a divisive issue by
                    the time I left Hawaii. Everybody in Hawaii was pro-war. I did have a lot of
                    worries that our policy was inherently a failure, that looking at the map there
                    was simply no way one could stop the North Vietnamese from looping around and
                    outflanking our efforts to defend South Vietnam unless we were prepared to
                    invade the North Vietnamese, which it was increasingly apparent we were not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: From about November, '67, to February, '69. I think it was in
                    February, '69, I was in the process of getting nominated as solicitor of Labor,
                    and so I moved over as a consultant in the Labor Department while I went through

                <p>SILBERMAN: I was an appellate lawyer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I don't think there's anything worth... The National Labor Relations
                    Board's position on labor issues tends to change with administrations, but
                    there's a certain core that doesn't change, and it generally regulates the
                    behavior of employers and unions in the workplace. I mean, when I say regulates,
                    it limits their behavior in certain respects.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I think this is going to divert you for a great... But actually,
                    the labor board then was closer to a centrist board, although it was pro-union,
                    than the present board, which tends to be more pro-union even than it was
                    then.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: The general counsel of the Labor Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you're saying that in this case, since I would imagine
                        labor, just by its nature as labor and business, in a ways - sort of
                        confrontational - that this would be a pretty active place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, we saw ourselves as having three constituencies: organized labor,
                    management, and the civil rights groups, because there was a good deal of civil
                    rights activities in the Labor Department as well. And they were conflicting,
                    obviously, the constituencies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Oh, I loved it. I loved it. But after a little more than a year at the
                    NLRB, not only had I taken a neutral rinse ostensibly, but I had become more of
                    a neutral, more dispassionate about labor-management affairs. In fact, that's
                    one of the reasons I went to the NLRB in the first place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the balance between labor and management
                        was at this particular time? Did you feel that it had reached a healthy
                        situation, or how was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I think so. I didn't think it was problematic. Now as we know in
                    hindsight, the trade unions' role in the American economy has diminished
                    considerably in the last 30 years and is no longer anywhere near as important.
                    And there are a lot of reasons for that, but that diverts from-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, I came in as part of the Nixon Administration. You're missing the
                    point. I'm appointed as a political appointee by the Nixon Administration,
                    actually in March of 1969.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: At the National Labor Relations Board I was, in effect, a civil
                    servant, a government line lawyer. I was not a political appointee. I was picked
                    out of there more for my experience in Hawaii, my background in Hawaii, to
                    become the solicitor, or general counsel, of the Labor Department, which is
                    equivalent to an assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were doing that, were you part of... Was there
                        much of a change on the Nixon Administration in the labor field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Sure, sure. Republican administrations... The Republican Labor
                    Departments under Eisenhower and Nixon tended to be centrist. Democratic Labor
                    Departments tended to be pro-union, strongly pro-union. But under Eisenhower's
                    Haggerty and Nixon's Shultz and Hodgson, the Labor Department was more centrist.
                    Under Reagan, the Labor Department switched to a more hostile-to-unions
                    position. And there are reasons for that. The building trades unions used to be
                    much more identified with the Republican Party, back under the Eisenhower and
                    Nixon era, than is true today.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now when you came in with the Nixon Administration,
                        there were two, weren't there, Secretaries of Labor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: George Shultz was Secretary. George Shultz was the Secretary who, with
                    the White House, recruited me to be solicitor of labor. Jim Hodgson succeeded
                    Shultz the next year, when Shultz went to OMB.</p>

                        and my feelings reflected by many that he was probably the best Secretary of
                        State we've had, certainly after the Acheson-Marshall period or something
                        like that. But-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: You think he was better than Kissinger?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But - I mean, all round. But-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: He's a better man than Kissinger. I think Kissinger was a better
                    Secretary of State. George was my mentor. I was his prot�g�. He recruited me in
                    as solicitor of labor. Partly through his influence, I became number two the
                    next year, under secretary, when Hodgson replaced him, although I was very close
                    to Jim, too. George offered me the post of under secretary of Treasury when I
                    left the Labor Department in '72 (actually, I was fired) and we were friends in
                    San Francisco - and I acted as special envoy for him on the Middle East in 1984.
                    I have enormous regard for him as a person. I don't think he had the strategic
                    sense that Kissinger had. I don't have anywhere near as much regard for Henry as
                    a person, but I think he was a brilliant strategist, playing sometimes a weak
                    hand. I think George may have made a fundamental strategic error in the Middle
                    East in putting the United States behind the peace treaty in Lebanon, you may
                    recall, which could not possibly have been maintained given Syria's opposition.
                    And therefore it caused us great humiliation, not to speak of a lot of
                    casualties. I also thought he was... I tended to disagree with him about certain
                    strategic matters dealing with the Soviet Union, but I do have an enormous
                    regard for him as a human being, as a person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd like to pick up just a bit about George Shultz
                        because we are dealing with foreign affairs, how he operated when you saw
                        him sort of early on in government and the Labor Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, one of the things about George is he was very thoughtful. He
                    tended to believe very much in professionalism. That is to say, he had been a
                    labor economist as his profession, his specialty, and he tended to think that
                    professionals would give you the best answers to questions. On occasion I
                    thought that he was overly relying on professionals and would overly rely on
                    conventional wisdom, particularly if it was expressed by professionals, and that
                    would be true in the Labor Department as well as in the State Department. But I
                    would have to go through a whole series of matters of the Labor Department,
                    which it seems to me-</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: But he's a man of great presence and was a wonderful leader and

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were under secretary of Labor 1970-73. Did Nixon get
                        involved very much in what you were doing in the Labor Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, he did get involved in emergency strikes dealing with the
                    transportation industry, and he also got involved in the efforts to stabilize
                    wage rates in the construction industry, which were perceived to be going out of
                    sight, and ultimately in the cost of living initiative, which was wage-price
                    stabilization, freeze, wage and price controls. So those were the areas in which
                    he was most-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, the Nixon White House staff and all became quite
                        controversial not too much later. Did you have any dealings with them
                        particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Particularly with Ehrlichman's staff. Ehrlichman was working as
                    counsel for the President, and then he was promoted to assistant to the
                    President for domestic affairs. And with him and his deputy and assistants I
                    dealt a great deal on Labor Department affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well informed and... How did you find dealing with
                        Ehrlichman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Ehrlichman and staff, they were competent, well informed. And I also
                    then dealt with OMB, particularly a fellow by the name of Paul O'Neill, who's
                    subsequently become president of a major corporation. He was an assistant
                    director of OMB.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from what I gather, you're saying that this was
                        really quite a competent administration in dealing with matters which you
                        had to deal with in labor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes. Of course, I also dealt with George Shultz representing the White
                    House, when he moved over as director of OMB, on labor matters. In fact, if
                    there was any one single person who was dominant on labor policy subsequently it
                    was George Shultz, both as Secretary of Labor and as director of OMB. But
                    Ehrlichman's staff were also involved in the development of legislation, and OMB
                    as well. And I dealt with, it seems to me, a range of very competent people.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Between trade unions? Well, it's interesting enough, by 1972, the
                    AFL-CIO remained neutral in the Nixon-McGovern fight, which was quite
                    extraordinary for the AFL-CIO. And the building trades unions largely supported
                    Nixon. And some of my efforts in 1972 were to get the building trades unions to
                    support Nixon, which they did.</p>

                        there was also a reversal of the other side, where you found many people
                        supporting Nixon who would not have normally supported him.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, George Meany used to speak in scathing terms about McGovern. So
                    by '71-72, relations with the trade unions were even warmer than they had been
                    earlier. They were always reasonably good with the Labor Department, even from
                    '69-70,71, but they got much warmer.</p>

                        into the foreign affairs field, but we'll move to the time next time when

                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, actually, I had been fired, not to put too fine a point upon it,
                    as under secretary of Labor after the '72 election, or to put it accurately, my
                    resignation was accepted. All of us were required to submit resignations. And as
                    the Watergate matter developed, certain newspaper articles appeared which
                    indicated that the circumstances under which I had left lent credit to me, so
                    that when after the Saturday Night Massacre-</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is? Could you explain for the historian what the
                        Saturday Night Massacre was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Let's see if I can recall. It's October, 1973, when Elliott Richardson
                    had been instructed by the President to discharge Archibald Cox as special
                    prosecutor and resigned instead. His deputy, Bill Ruckelshaus, the deputy
                    attorney general, was then instructed to do so, and he refused, and he was
                    fired. And then Robert Bork, the then third-ranking official in the Justice
                    Department, the solicitor general, became acting attorney general, and he
                    discharged Cox. It all happened around midnight. After those events, Bill Saxbe,
                    who was a Republican senator from Ohio, a former attorney general of the State
                    of Ohio, came in as attorney general. He was easily confirmed as senator. And I,
                    because of the publicity or the newspaper articles connecting me in a favorable
                    way (at least from my point of view) to certain people in the White House in the
                    events leading up to the election of 1972, was chosen as deputy attorney
                    general, and I was confirmed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, this is a very important point in history. What
                        was your impression at the time about the turmoil that was coming about
                        because of the Watergate crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: You know, I think that is such an extensive matter. Actually, I'm
                    giving a speech in a couple of weeks up at the University of Minnesota Law
                    School, a banquet speech, in which I describe some of the events. I can give you
                    a copy of the speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether I could have it on a diskette. Are
                        they going to type it up on a-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, you can append this, so... But it's just an
                        interesting thing, and since it's a personal account, I think it would be
                        very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I would be glad to give it to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: But it seems to me that if I were to spend the time on the events from
                    February of 1974 or even October of '73, when the Saturday Night Massacre took
                    place, to the time I come in as deputy attorney general, and then the last six
                    months of Nixon and the first almost year of Ford, I'm talking about one of the
                    more dramatic series of events of American history, and I would devote much more
                    time than you want on that. Q: Well, as an amateur historian, I hate to see it
                    go, but I'll buy that.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Where were you during the Watergate?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Greece during most of that time and having a hard
                        time figuring out what it was about. And of course the Greeks-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Typical European-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and because we weren't getting the full flavor. If
                        you're not there, you're not getting the impact of what's happening and all,
                        and the newspaper accounts, and-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I entered that period, or by early '75 I was acting attorney
                    general, because Saxbe had gone off to India , and I remained there until - in
                    order to get Ed Levy confirmed. I wished to resign at that point for several
                    reasons. Number one, I was exhausted, and number two, I couldn't afford to stay
                    as deputy attorney general. I had a son at Exeter at that point. Ford asked me
                    to come into the White House to run intelligence, but I declined, and eventually
                    Kissinger offered me the post of ambassador to Germany, or suggested it, and my
                    wife declined. She refused. He then suggested Yugoslavia, which for reasons that
                    I have suggested I was always interested in, and I went off to Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is the result of John Adams at Dartmouth,
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. Well, a couple of years before, as under secretary of Labor, I
                    had traveled to Yugoslavia. I had gone to Italy and Yugoslavia. And I also, when
                    I was there, was tasked with a minor diplomatic mission. You may recall that the
                    Labor Department plays a role in the International Labor Organization, which as
                    you may know is a strange organization. It was set up after the Treaty of
                    Versailles, but it really is folded under the UN. And the ILO affairs are run
                    through the United States Government by a consortium of State, Labor, and
                    Commerce. And so as under secretary of Labor, I went to Italy and also to
                    Yugoslavia, in part on ILO matters, and so I had had some exposure to modern
                    Yugoslavia. But you're quite right, I had retained from my days at Dartmouth an
                    intense interest in Yugoslavia in particular and the Balkans in general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the ILO, and not to let this completely go,
                        what was the feeling about the ILO during the time you were in the
                        Department of Labor as an instrument of international American policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, do you know that I also played a role as special envoy vis-�-vis
                    the ILO when I was ambassador to Yugoslavia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't, so we'll pick that up, but let's talk about
                        from the labor perspective when you were there, how you and maybe your
                        colleagues saw it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I will tell you a little vignette which you may find amusing. My
                    first visit to the ILO in Geneva was as solicitor of labor. I went over heading
                    a Labor Department delegation. And there were two Foreign Service officers who
                    were assigned to me to advise me through this, and I went into a plenary session
                    of the ILO. Stop for a minute. The deputy under secretary for international
                    affairs in the Labor Department was the major figure in the United States
                    Government for ILO matters, but of course, it had foreign policy implications
                    and so Foreign Service officers were involved. And when I went over there as
                    solicitor, I can't recall precisely why I was being asked to come, but obviously
                    the under secretary for International Affairs had asked me to come as the senior
                    Labor Department official. I guess I outranked him. For some reason, I was
                    there. And this would have been in 1969, probably in the late fall, or it could
                    have been in early '70. Now at that plenary session, the Cuban representative
                    made a bloodcurdling speech attacking the United States, and I recall that it
                    was my natural disposition to respond. And the Foreign Service officers had
                    written a speech for me, and the speech, I thought, was rather namby-pamby and
                    certainly didn't respond to this unexpected attack from the Cuban ambassador.
                    And so I discarded the speech and instead said, and I recall it as if it were
                    yesterday, “I do not wish to respond to the representative of the Government of
                    Cuba because I regard his government as a temporary political phenomenon.” The
                    place went wild. The Russians jumped up, asked for repeat translation through
                    their earphones, and one of them picked up the earphones and threw them across
                    the room. The Foreign Service officers were aghast. On the other hand, there
                    were a number of persons in the room who were rather pleased, as I recall. Now
                    the amusing thing about it in hindsight is I was right only in long historical
                    sense, but the Cuban government outlasted the Russian government!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from the labor part-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Let me tell you about what the problem was in those days. There was a
                    good deal of battling in the ILO on what might be referred to as ideological
                    issues. The American trade union movement, particularly back in those days, with
                    George Meany as the president and Lane Kirkland as the secretary-treasurer, were
                    fierce anti-communists and wished to resist, with all the strength of the United
                    States and as much as we could persuade our allies to do with their strengths as
                    well, the efforts on the part of the Soviets to obliterate the fundamental idea
                    of the ILO, which was free trade unions. The Soviets hated that notion, and of
                    course wished to do all they could to reduce its importance. This was part and
                    parcel of the same kind of fights that were taking place in the UN itself, but
                    in the ILO it was particularly combustible because the American labor movement
                    played such a major role. And that is why I got involved later as ambassador to
                    Yugoslavia with a second hat as special envoy in the ILO, which led ultimately
                    to our withdrawal from the ILO for a couple of years and then our return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm not sure if I've got the name right, Jake
                        Silverthorn? He was sort of the ideologue of the AFL-CIO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, that's not his name. I know who you mean, but I've forgotten his
                    name now. There was a guy by the name of Irving Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Irving Brown in Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, but there was another guy - Lovestone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Lovestone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: But Lovestone and Irving Brown were not individuals who were
                    policy-setting on their own. The key was that George Meany and Lane Kirkland and
                    much of the leadership of the AFL-CIO, particularly in the building trades but
                    other unions as well, including UAW, which was not part of the AFL-CIO at one
                    point but was nevertheless fiercely anti-communist even though left-wing, that
                    many of those unions leaders regarded the fight against Communism as of seminal
                    importance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they'd fought the battle themselves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: They had fought it domestically. That is correct. Back in the '30's.
                    But they also saw it in international terms, and as you will recall, the AFL-CIO
                    was one of the major opponents of detente as practiced and sponsored by
                    Kissinger and Nixon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Yugoslavia from '75 to '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before going out to Yugoslavia, there's a usual procedure
                        of sort of reading up on the place and all. How did you see our relations
                        with Yugoslavia at that time? What were you getting both from the State
                        Department but also, you might say, your own internal agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Let me stop for a moment. You know, I've written at least two articles
                    in foreign policy journals concerning my experience in Yugoslavia. Are you
                    familiar with those?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: One in Foreign Affairs, which is not so much on Yugoslavia but it was
                    a good title. It was “Towards Presidential Control of the State Department,”
                    which was quite controversial. And the other one, in Foreign Policy Magazine,
                    which was entitled “Europe's Fiddler on the Roof,” referring to Yugoslavia. The
                    “take” on Yugoslavia that came from the European Bureau, which I assimilated
                    during my period of orientation, was of course that Yugoslavia was a major
                    success in American foreign policy because it had broken with the Soviet Union,
                    at least to a certain extent-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Tito.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, Tito had broken with the Soviet Union in 1948, and our objective
                    should as much as possible be to sustain the independence, territorial
                    integrity, and sovereignty of Yugoslavia. That was almost a mantra, those three
                    terms. It was also true that within the State Department and the CIA and the
                    NSC, there was a keen awareness that if World War III was to break out, if there
                    was to be a conflict between the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union, and the Western
                    powers, it could easily come about because of a conflict in Yugoslavia,
                    particularly in the event that Tito should die and there should be some kind of
                    struggle for power in which the Soviets would seek to intervene. There was a
                    general perception that the Soviets still licked their wounds about 1948 and
                    would love to intervene in Yugoslavia, putting paid to the independence
                    movement. So one of the reasons that I felt that I was interested in going there
                    as ambassador was that I could see the stakes could be very great indeed, and it
                    was fascinating in geostrategic terms, but it was also fascinating in
                    ideological terms, because I wished to try to understand as much as possible
                    about the Yugoslav self-management, “Third Way,” whatever you would like to call
                    it, their experiment with a modified Communism. Of course, the Eurocommunism
                    movement was very big at that time, too, so that made Yugoslavia important for
                    those reasons. Generally, however, when I went off to Yugoslavia, I had spent a
                    good deal of time talking with people in the European Bureau, the CIA, and NSC
                    concerning their views on Yugoslavia, and I think I described the State
                    Department's approach to Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying - I always, when I served in Yugoslavia
                        earlier, the feeling was very much that Berlin was the number one place
                        where all hell could break loose, and Yugoslavia, with the death of Tito and
                        the possible dismemberment of Yugoslavia, was number two as far as how World
                        War III might start.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That's correct. And by the time I went out, Berlin was no longer
                    perceived as the place where it would start, because by that time a modus
                    operandi had developed there, but Yugoslavia was always a potential flashpoint
                    because essentially it could be thought that neither the West nor the Soviet
                    Union would be comfortable or accept a Yugoslavia moving precisely in one
                    direction or the other.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a chance to get the feeling of Henry
                        Kissinger at that time towards sort of East-West relations, particularly
                        Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, some exposure before I went out, more through cable traffic and
                    other meetings with Kissinger. But that goes into a broad range of issues. As
                    you probably realize, after I came to Belgrade I gradually came to have a
                    modified or somewhat different view than the standard European Bureau of the
                    State Department view on Yugoslavia. And Kissinger, I think, was rather bemused
                    at the differences and some of the sparks that flew between me on the one hand
                    and Art Hartman and others in the European Bureau concerning my views on
                    Yugoslavia. I came to have a different view. I thought the view of the European
                    Bureau was as much as possible to accommodate and not pay much attention to the
                    aggravations that Tito caused in international affairs, because at all costs we
                    should support his independence. My own view, and this was during the d�nouement
                    of the Vietnam War. My own view, after I went to Yugoslavia, was that Tito was
                    beginning to lose a good deal of respect for the United States as a major power
                    and thought the tide was running against us. He had been very tough in his own
                    army to repress or get rid of any officers who he thought were sympathetic to
                    the West. And I took him to be more concerned about Western influences than
                    Soviet, in part not because he was afraid of the West in terms of Western power
                    - he didn't like Western ideals, which he was afraid of - but he was not afraid
                    of Western power, but he was increasingly afraid of Soviet power. Now that led
                    me to believe that our policy was somewhat incorrectly formulated, in that we
                    should be much tougher with Tito and much more unyielding and much more
                    aggressive, because I thought he was a man who reacted to power above all else
                    and his perception of strength. And I thought that the more accommodating we
                    were to Tito the more he was inclined to move towards the Soviet Union. So we
                    had a fundamental difference of views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things you were saying... Something I've gotten
                        from some of my interviews was that at this time - it's hard to go back to
                        the period, but there was a feeling of we had to leave abruptly from
                        Vietnam. I mean this was quite a shock to the system, and there was a
                        general feeling, I think reflected by Kissinger - at least this is what I
                        get from others - that really the Soviet Union was moving ahead and was
                        gaining strength and that we were weakening and that much of what Kissinger
                        was doing was trying to curtail the success of the Soviet Union but
                        essentially it was a rather pessimistic viewpoint. Did you pick that
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think that is quite correct. I think Kissinger perceived himself as
                    fighting a defensive battle. I became convinced that that mindset was incorrect,
                    and I vigorously opposed, for instance, the so-called Sonnenfeldt Doctrine. I
                    had sent a cable strongly criticizing it. It was a set of views that Sonnenfeldt
                    expressed at a meeting of European ambassadors in London with Kissinger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean American ambassadors who were-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That's right, American ambassadors to Europe met in London in the
                    winter of 1975-76, where Sonnenfeldt first set forth his views concerning our
                    policy towards Eastern Europe, which, in his view, could be described as one of
                    seeking stability and perhaps accommodation. I thought that was fundamentally
                    wrong. I thought the strategic aim, the most important strategic aim of American
                    foreign policy, was the disestablishment of the Soviet Union through prudent
                    means. And I said that specifically at a convention after I left the government
                    in a debate with, amongst others, Bob Strauss, Phil Habib. As I recall, it was
                    in Hawaii, and I think President Carter was there, but I can't be certain about
                    that and I can't quite figure what the time was. I remember at the time making
                    that argument and Phil Habib being appalled that anyone would state American
                    policy in those terms, but I had that view increasingly as ambassador to
                    Yugoslavia. I was opposed to the psychological and ideological aspect of
                    detente. Now it's a question of degree, of course, but I wished to lean forward
                    and to be more aggressive in challenging the Soviet ideologically in every way
                    that was prudent. And therefore I sent a cable flatly disagreeing with the
                    Sonnenfeldt Doctrine, a cable which, incidentally, arrived in the State
                    Department, as I found out later, with some trepidation because the Sonnenfeldt
                    Doctrine - and I did not know this as ambassador to Yugoslavia - had leaked and
                    become quite a bone of contention between Reagan challenging Ford for the
                    Presidential nomination. So obviously, news of an American ambassador in
                    disagreement with the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine would not have been welcome if it
                    leaked. But my cable did not leak. I understand Larry Eagleburger as under
                    secretary for management went through desperate efforts to avoid it leaking.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: At some point I must be perfectly candid with you. Either in my
                    orientation process - I think it probably started in the orientation process - I
                    began to get the sense that my nomination as ambassador to Yugoslavia was not
                    exactly a welcome event for the professional Foreign Service, and I was rather
                    shocked and surprised and thought, Well, you know, I'm pretty well-informed
                    about Yugoslavia, and indeed on international affairs in general, more so than
                    one would expect of the typical non-Foreign Service appointee; but I did not
                    realize that for the Foreign Service officer, Eastern Europe was thought of as a
                    preserve of the Foreign Service and that my nomination would be seen, as the
                    first since Gronouski as ambassador to Poland under Kennedy, as a break in this
                    tradition and quite offensive to the Foreign Service. Of course, I was
                    blissfully ignorant of all of that. If I had gone to Germany, I would not have
                    been so regarded.</p>

                        that, but it was pretty much a preserve of those who have served in
                        Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Precisely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or had very close... I mean, there was a real Yugoslav

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, exactly correct, exactly correct. I knew nothing about this. I
                    knew nothing about the... I did not ask to be appointed ambassador to
                    Yugoslavia. It was offered to me by Kissinger and Scowcroft, both of whom had...
                    Scowcroft had served in Yugoslavia. Eagleburger was enthusiastically in favor of
                    it, and he had served there. It never even occurred to me that the Foreign
                    Service would resist it, nor did it occur to me, frankly, that the career civil
                    service - like the Foreign Service - would have anything to say about political
                    appointees. You know, after all, I had been the chief operating officer, as
                    under secretary of Labor and as deputy attorney general - two major departments
                    of government. I'd never had any difficulty dealing with the career service,
                    even though the Labor Department was largely composed of people whose politics
                    were contrary to the Republicans; and that was true - not by any means as much -
                    at Justice, but certainly true of many. I never had any difficulty dealing with
                    career lawyers in the Justice Department or the FBI. I never had any difficulty
                    dealing with careerists in the Labor Department, even though my views were often
                    different. I never detected the kind of resistance to political control in
                    either of those departments that I saw in the State Department. And that's what
                    shocked me in the State Department, when it became apparent that the conduct of
                    foreign affairs was not thought by most career officers to be the preserve of
                    the political appointees. In that respect the State Department was absolutely
                    different from any other department of government. And it took me a while to
                    understand it, and of course I wrote about it in my article in Foreign Affairs,
                    “Towards Presidential Control of the State Department,” and understood it from a
                    somewhat more sympathetic viewpoint as I thought about it in terms of
                    incentives, economic incentives, and management and so forth, and the reason why
                    this tradition developed. But I was an innocent when I arrived in the European
                    Bureau. My wife began to detect that there was a certain resistance to our
                    appointment, but I was not aware of it until I arrived in Belgrade.</p>

                        if a political appointee comes in, all they want to know is, is this a real
                        buddy of the President who can pick up the phone and have clout or is this
                        just a castoff of some senator who wants to take care of some friend who
                        really has nothing? I mean, that's the major consideration, because they're
                        very well trained in this. But when you get to Eastern Europe, I think
                        you're moving into a different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, that's true. Now even for anybody who wished to pay attention, it
                    was perfectly obvious that I was rather close to President Ford as well as
                    Kissinger. Kissinger had begged me to go into the White House to run
                    intelligence, which I refused to do because he at that point distrusted Colby. I
                    had been deeply involved in intelligence matters as deputy attorney general, so
                    I was not a total neophyte about matters that related to foreign policy, nor was
                    I without my political connections both in the White House and with Kissinger.
                    So I was quite amazed. I couldn't figure out why, but as you well understand,
                    the Foreign Service Gestalt was resistance to... And I thought the fact that I
                    was not a wealthy contributor but was someone who had served in various senior
                    government positions based presumably on whatever qualifications I had brought
                    by myself would be perceived by the Foreign Service as a good thing. But I
                    think, rather, that it was rather a bad thing, the fact that I did know
                    something about foreign affairs, that I had had senior positions in the
                    Executive Branch, and that I was well connected made me even less acceptable for
                    Yugoslavia. That's what astonished me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I mean, actually, I was seriously considered at the point to be CIA
                    director. In fact, that was possibly what would have occurred if I had gone into
                    intelligence in the White House. I did not wish to do that for a whole host of
                    reasons. But I was hardly someone that you... I was not your typical political
                    contributor. So I was quite astonished at the reaction. It took me a while to
                    even understand it. As I said, it wasn't until I got to Belgrade.</p>

                    frankly it never even occurred to me it was possible, but she sensed it. When we
                    arrived in Belgrade it was palpable. I don't know whether you realize this, but

                        and for people who are looking at this from, you know, management type

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: All right, I'd be glad to. Mack Toon had been the ambassador in
                    Yugoslavia before I came. And I had known Mack. We had actually had dinner a
                    couple of times in Potomac, in fact, when I first came to Washington. I think he
                    was head of policy planning at State. And we got into a rather fierce argument
                    one night concerning the Soviet Union and Israel. I remember telling him that it
                    was my perception that from the Israeli point of view the single most important
                    strategic element or concept for them was to get the Soviet Jews into Israel,
                    because that would enormously increase their population and therefore be an
                    offset vis-�-vis the Arab world. And I'll never forget Mack Toon telling me that
                    his experience vis-�-vis the Soviet Union and Israel, he thought I was wrong.
                    The Israelis did not want the Russian Jews. And I remember thinking that night
                    that he was rather pompous and clearly wrong. But I subsequently came to have a
                    higher view about him, and he and my son actually worked together at the end of
                    the Bush Administration in pursuing the question of what happened to the
                    Americans who were captured during the Korean War.</p>

                    remember, Henry Kissinger asking my view about sending Mack Toon to Israel, and
                    I thought that was a great idea. I think at the time that I was going to
                    Yugoslavia I said it was a great idea because I thought he was rather
                    unsympathetic to the Israelis and would be the exact instrument to carry out
                    Kissinger's policy vis-�-vis Israel, which of course is where he went. I
                    remember it at the time because Kissinger was talking about where I might go,
                    and at some point he mentioned Israel. I had no particular desire to go there at
                    that time. One of the reasons he thought it would be interesting to go to
                    Germany was that I would be the first Jewish ambassador to Germany, which is
                    incidentally one of the reasons my wife... My wife did not want to go to Germany
                    because she couldn't stand the thought of having to visit concentration camps,
                    which was the only thing she ever said no to in my marriage, with all the
                    strange things I've done, and in many ways I regret not having gone there,
                    because I had a very strong view in favor of the unification of Germany because
                    it was in American interest, which was unusual at the time. But in any event,
                    that's neither here not there. I'm diverting.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Belgrade, the wives of the Foreign Service officers,
                    particularly led by the DCM's wife, were palpably nasty to my wife. I remember
                    them telling her that there were only certain times that she could play tennis
                    on our tennis court. She had, of course, been part of my life through the Nixon
                    administration and had actually served on a presidential commission for the
                    education of disadvantaged children and had actually worked as a volunteer in
                    the President's reelection campaign in '72. She was hardly na�ve, but in many
                    ways she was innocent. She had never run into this kind of resistance or
                    nastiness. And it was palpable. I mean, it was... And that, because it became
                    apparent to me that this was the way in which the Foreign Service was reflecting
                    their hostility to my appointment. In dealing with me, they were correct -
                    obviously, scrupulously correct, but not a step more than correct, and Dudley
                    Miller was I didn't think enormously helpful. And it was apparent to me after a
                    month or so that Dudley and his wife were particularly the core of the
                    resistance to my appointment, which I thought, you know, this is silly - why
                    should I tolerate a DCM who was hostile to my appointment? So I simply called
                    him in one day and said, “You're going home.” He said, “You can't do that.” I
                    said, “The hell I can't. You'll be quite surprised. I'm sending off a cable to
                    Kissinger telling him you're going back.” And I don't think that had ever been
                    done.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Not by a political appointee. So I sent Dudley back, and things

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is often the problem. The DCM-ambassador
                        relationship is very important, and often a DCM who's familiar with a
                        country falls foul of an ambassador because sometimes they've got too many
                        connections. I mean they know the people and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That was not it at all. I was very grateful that he would have
                    developed. My impression of him, perfectly candidly, was that he was a gopher
                    for Mack Toon. Mack was like a banyan tree under which not a lot grew. Mack was
                    a very strong, tough ambassador, and I think Dudley was simply a gopher, not a
                    true deputy. I don't think he had an enormous intellectual ability. But there
                    were some very talented people in the embassy, ultimately. Mark Palmer came out
                    as the political officer, and I thought he was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing Mark now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, and he was sent to me specifically by Eagleburger and Kissinger.
                    He had been Kissinger's speech writer, so I knew he was absolutely first class.
                    I wanted first-class people. When I sent Dudley back, I asked Larry Eagleburger
                    to find somebody really good for DCM, and he found Harry Bergold, who ended up
                    as ambassador somewhere, I can't recall. Unfortunately, he was on his way to
                    being my DCM when Don Rumsfeld, one of my best friends, who was Secretary of
                    Defense, swiped him as an assistant secretary of defense, so at that point -
                    some months had gone by - I had brought a special assistant with me, a fellow by
                    the name of Brandon Sweitzer. As a political appointee I was entitled to bring a
                    special assistant. Brandon Sweitzer had been a White House Fellow, he spoke four
                    languages, and he had been Pete Peterson's executive assistant, after his White
                    House Fellowship days, Pete Peterson being Secretary of Commerce. I had
                    encountered him both on the White House staff and working for Peterson, and I
                    don't recall whether he approached me or I approached him when I was picked to
                    be ambassador to Yugoslavia, but in any event, he wanted to go off as my special
                    assistant. He was a very able and talented guy, and so after a few months of not
                    being able to come up with somebody suitable for DCM, I said, Oh, the hell with
                    it, I was going to make Brandon the DCM. Well, I thought the Foreign Service
                    would have conniptions. You can't do that. So I ended up not having a DCM and
                    made him de facto DCM, and the Yugoslav Government and, of course, all other
                    embassies, had to treat him as DCM. I forget what I called him - counselor? But
                    he was the de facto DCM for the two years that I was there, and he did an
                    excellent job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the political reporting? Was
                        there a spin as far as you watched the people reporting from the embassy on
                        Yugoslav affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, you know, after a while it was my view that the reporting on
                    Yugoslav affairs from the embassy was a matter to be controlled by the
                    ambassador. That doesn't mean I wrote every cable - of course not - but I did
                    approve and edit and very definitely felt that reporting was under my
                    supervision. When Mark Palmer arrived, replacing the political appointee who was
                    there - I can't recall who was there before him, but Mark Palmer was there and
                    Marty McLean was there, and these were young men whose views about the Soviet
                    Union detente, ideological questions, were similar to mine. Mark and I used to
                    constantly argue over who was more of a revolutionary, his political views were
                    on the left side of the political spectrum, I on the right side, but we had
                    similar views about United States needing to confront the Soviet Union, and in
                    similar ways. So we were very much in synch. It took me some time before my
                    thinking gelled, but not all that long, a few months. And now with respect to
                    the actual factual reporting, I don't recall my having much concern with the
                    orientation of the officers. I was always anxious to get more and more
                    information. I was pushing them all the time. One of the things I did do, which
                    I'm sure you have views about, is that it occurred to me that much of our
                    information came at dinner parties and that because of protocol the wives of
                    officers would usually sit seated at dinner next to the official we were trying
                    to pump, and that they would be a hell of a lot better at pumping them if they
                    knew what they needed to get, what kind of information we were interested in. So
                    I adopted a technique of bringing the wives of officers, particularly the
                    political officers, into the tank once a week to brief them-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about that horrible plastic bubble
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. One of my younger officers complained at one point that his
                    wife knew more about American foreign policy towards Yugoslavia than he did
                    because she was at those weekly meetings. I also was responding to the
                    increasing concern that the country had about our wives of Foreign Service
                    officers. They couldn't really do anything in Yugoslavia, so how would they
                    remain stimulated and interested. Many of them were well-educated women. And so
                    I tried to double my staff by decree. But the economic reporting was generally
                    quite competent. Charles York was in charge of economic affairs. The
                    intelligence operations were well done. Dan Wages and Bert Gerber were my chiefs
                    of station. I hope that's no longer classified. And both of them were excellent.
                    Bert Gerber was really brilliant. He had come from Iran. My administrative
                    officer, Sheldon Krys, subsequently became an ambassador.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I thought he was wonderful, and we had a particularly troublesome
                    problem when Carl Albert came as the head of a CODEL to Yugoslavia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, Speaker of the House, from Oklahoma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, and he was a terrible drunk, and when I found out he was leading
                    the CODEL, at the invitation of the Yugoslavs, I was appalled, because I knew
                    what a terrible drunk he was and what a cipher he was. I actually went to the
                    Yugoslav Foreign Ministry at one point when we were talking about the CODEL, and
                    I explained that he was a drunk and that there was to be no alcohol served while
                    he was in Yugoslavia at any official occasion. Well, I forget, the foreign
                    minister or somebody said, “How can you say that, Ambassador? He's the
                    third-ranking official in the United States?” And I said, “Well, that's more for
                    show.” Which was an incredible thing to say. But I was so anxious at that point
                    not to portray a sense of weakness or a reality of weakness to the Yugoslavs -
                    and I knew Albert from my days in the Executive Branch - and I was hopeful that
                    they would take from me, adopt the position that he was a convenient figure for
                    officials in the Congress - which was true - and he was not to be taken
                    seriously. No liquor was to be served. Well, the funny thing was, he would
                    desperately try to get hold of liquor anyway. He was an alcoholic. And he was
                    quite frustrated about my efforts to prevent it, and he got hold of Sheldon
                    Krys, and he said, “I want a bottle of bourbon, and I know what the ambassador's
                    doing, but he's a political appointee, and you're going to be around after he
                    goes, and I will make sure you're in real trouble unless I get a bottle of
                    bourbon.” Sheldon came to me, and I said, “Give him his bottle of bourbon. I
                    can't protect you.”</p>

                        had a chance to do a bit of absorbing of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, one of the things that was most interesting of all was how
                    desperate the Yugoslavs were to not permit us to understand their
                    micro-decision-making. You may recall that they made much of self-management in
                    this Third Way. Now I thought it was important to try to understand how this
                    system really worked - who was making the crucial decisions with respect to any
                    particular enterprise? Was it the workers' council, which was doctrine or dogma?
                    Was it the chief executive, selected often by the workers' council? Was it the
                    Communist Party in the enterprise? Or was it the trade union? It could be, in
                    any particular enterprise, any one of those four. Perhaps the most successful
                    enterprises were run by executives that had some kind of constituency within
                    those other three. But when I was trying hard to find out how things actually
                    worked, the Yugoslavs regarded that as very threatening because, for one thing,
                    they didn't know for sure how things worked, and Kardelj would set up this
                    doctrine, and it may not have anything to do with what actually was happening,
                    so they found it very threatening that somebody was trying to understand exactly
                    how they were making decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kardelj being sort of the ideologue, the guru of the
                        Communist Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. And actually there was one speech that the head of their OPA,
                    the minister of the interior, had made in which they specifically identified the
                    very kinds of questions that I was asking as very dangerous probes by
                    intelligence agents. There had been some discussion about my involvement with
                    the CIA, so the Yugoslavs always felt that I had some shadowy connection with
                    the CIA. Much of the dealings with Yugoslavia dealt with international affairs,
                    that is to say, ILO, the UN kind of things, in which the Yugoslavs, as leaders
                    of the Third World, the Nonaligned, were constantly giving us great grief. And
                    there were some specific instances where Yugoslavs played a very mischievous
                    role, one with respect... I'll never forget, which I got through intelligence
                    leaks, that Tito had encouraged the North Koreans to create an incident on the
                    line between North and South Korea, which you may recall eventuated with a
                    couple of Americans being killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had just arrived - I was consul general in Seoul at the
                        time - and that was a very difficult couple of days. That was known as “the
                        tree-chopping incident,” which would have been in the summer of 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. Tito, we found out through intelligence sources that Tito had
                    actually encouraged the Koreans to do that. There was something coming up in a
                    Nonaligned meeting, and they wanted a crisis of some sort. I regarded that as an
                    indication of a very, shall we say, unfriendly act on the part of the Yugoslav
                    Government. There were other things. So we would run into these kinds of
                    conflicts, and I will get to the other one.</p>
                <p>I was also, however, very interested in trying to sell to the Yugoslavs weapons
                    that could be used in the event of a Soviet incursion. Perhaps the paradigm was
                    the TOW.</p>

                    first of all, it would be helpful - but obviously a signal that their primary
                    concern was the Soviet Union. I spent much of my time trying to understand the
                    Yugoslav military - politically, what their political views were. The Yugoslavs
                    were very resistant. The government was very resistant - the Party was very
                    resistant - to allowing me or my officers to spend much time with the Yugoslav
                    military; yet it was of enormous importance to the United States to try to
                    figure out where their political allegiances were. There had been this purge a
                    year before, I think, where pro-Western elements had been driven out. I was
                    desperate to try to find out as much as I could. It was hard, damned hard. I
                    remember one significant bit of information came to me through the wife of a
                    Yugoslav admiral - I think his name was Mamilov - who was head of the navy. The
                    wife said something of interest to my wife at a dinner party, or even outside,
                    and I insisted that my wife go down and write a MemCon to put in a cable, and
                    she - I remember at the time she resisted - said, “Well, that was confidential.”
                    I said, “Honey, there's nothing confidential, and besides, don't you think
                    that's more likely to be communications from Admiral Mamilov to me than it is
                    wife to wife?” So in any event, we did do that. I can't recall precisely what
                    the communication was. Well, that was a major objective, to try to find out what
                    the political attitudes within the Soviet military were, for obvious
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by that time, were we seeing the Yugoslav military
                        as more Serb-dominated than it had been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That's interesting. My recollection now is that there was a sort of
                    a... I don't think there was a perception that the military had been more
                    Serb-dominated. It always had been to a certain extent Serb-dominated, and
                    particularly, should I say, Montenegrin-dominated. I think 20 per cent of the
                    generals were Montenegrin, and only 500,000 Yugoslavs were Montenegrins. Of
                    course, as you know, they have a splendid military record.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: And that was a constant bone of potential contention within
                    Yugoslavia. I recall that there was a good deal of concern that you could detect
                    amongst Croatians concerning Tito's wife, who was a Lika Serb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Considered the most beautiful woman in Yugoslavia, but
                        also from the Vikraina area. SILBERMAN: Exactly, and fiercely pro-Serb and
                        anti-Croat. So there was a good deal of concern amongst the Croats what her
                        role might be. But on that point the Yugoslav government was, of course,
                        fanatic in their effort to project an image of unity within Yugoslavia. I
                        remember there was a census taken, I think when I was there. They asked
                        people what they regarded as their nationality, and only 11 per cent of the
                        people in Yugoslavia described their nationality as “Yugoslav.” I don't know
                        whether they knew what they were doing when they took that census, but it
                        was an ominous note. And we knew the centrifugal forces were potentially
                        quite significant. There was this perception in the State Department, the
                        European Bureau, that the unity of Yugoslavia was very much in our interest.
                        And on that I had a somewhat different view in that I did agree that we
                        should not be in the business of encouraging centrifugal forces, but that
                        our primary concern should be encouraging democracy and freedom, and insofar
                        as those two interests conflicted, encouraging democracy was more important.
                        In that respect, I think the European Bureau as a whole said, “No, no, no,
                        unity is more important.” And that reflected a difference in our views of
                        the importance of ideology as opposed to other factors. The State Department
                        has never been as comfortable with ideology as people outside the State
                        Department, as you well know.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That was not true of Palmer. He was very much an ideologue. Now that's
                    not to say that I would have thought to encourage the kind of breakup of
                    Yugoslavia that could encourage the Soviet Union to come in, but the Yugoslavs
                    were constantly whispering in our ear that the only thing that kept Yugoslavia
                    together and therefore made it a strategic independent entity in the middle of
                    the Balkans was the Communist Party. Now I think they were wrong, but they were
                    close. The thing that held Yugoslavia together was not the Communist Party; it
                    was the fear of the Soviet Union. Ergo, Yugoslavia fell apart not when Tito died
                    - there was a lot of talk of Tito as the key - but when the Soviet Union
                    collapsed and there was no longer a threat that kept Yugoslavia together.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Oh, sure. We'd spend an ungodly amount of time on that. In fact, if
                    anything, that was my major objective as ambassador, which was to try to figure
                    out what we should do - we being the government of the United States - in the
                    event Tito died, and various scenarios came to play.</p>

                        thought was most likely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I always thought it was possible that you could get an internal
                    conflict within Yugoslavia which would lead the Soviet Union to come in. I
                    didn't know how lengthy. And that such conflict could be touched of by Tito's
                    death. But we didn't know. We weren't sure. We didn't know how strong the
                    centrifugal forces were, the nationalist centrifugal forces. We couldn't measure
                    them. I do remember thinking to myself that there had to be some reason why the
                    vast majority of Croats who emigrated to the United States or Canada or
                    Australia became such fierce supporters of an independent Croatia and couldn't
                    believe that that didn't reflect the view of the majority of people in
                    Croatia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the Soviet threat at that time. We're
                        talking about '75-77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Quite substantially. As I said, it was the single most important
                    question in American foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was it the feeling that this was an aggressive Soviet

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, of course. It was my view that unless we counterbalanced their
                    aggression, that we were risking a situation in which their aggressiveness and
                    our defensiveness would lead to a diminution in our position and an increase in
                    theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's hard to capture this thing because we're talking now
                        in 1998, and the Soviet Union has disappeared and all and is seen to be much

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think it's fair to say, I was more confident of our triumph in this
                    struggle than most people. Indeed, after I left Yugoslavia and went out a couple
                    of years later to California, I went and lectured. I remember a long lecture at
                    Stanford in which I predicted the Soviet Union would collapse before 2000. I
                    said it was more likely than not. I remember at the time being almost hooted
                    about it. But I didn't think it would happen without our being more assertive,
                    leaning forward, if you will.</p>

                        Helsinki Accords - as being of importance, I mean, particularly the

                        sort of break up the Soviet Union, but Kissinger certainly did not. I mean,
                        he dismissed this, and I was wondering-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, yes. All of those issues, which I put in the ideological basket,
                    although I had enormous regard and respect for Kissinger, I thought he was
                    fundamentally wrong in not understanding the importance of that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think there's a good deal of truth to what you say. I think that's a
                    very important point. You know, I thought all of those issues were of enormous
                    importance and were the field on which we should be most aggressive in dealing
                    with the Soviet Union. When I came back after Yugoslavia, I joined the Committee
                    on the Present Danger. I was asked to join that organization. Do you remember
                    what that organization was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: The Committee on the Present Danger was an organization formed by Paul
                    Nitze, Lane Kirkland (of the AFL-CIO), Charlie Walker (who had been deputy
                    secretary of Treasury under Nixon) - carefully balanced, one Democrat for One
                    Republican - bipartisan. The Committee on the Present Danger was an anti-d�tente
                    group that met for three or four years. Reagan was a member, Ronald Reagan, and
                    the heart and soul of the democratic half of that was the AFL-CIO. Now I was one
                    of the Republican appointments that was part of that organization. We would meet
                    for three or four days a year, discuss foreign policy and defense policy, and
                    with respect to strategic matters, military matters, and ideological matters we
                    were generally critical of the d�tentists, whether they be in the Ford
                    Administration or the Carter Administration. Now I should bring you up to date
                    on the ILO. There are two things I should bring you up to date on. You may be
                    familiar with the contretemps over Laszlo Toth in Yugoslavia?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do want to talk about it. I'm an old consular hand, and
                        - why don't we talk about Laszlo Toth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Toth was, as you know, a naturalized American who worked for a sugar
                    company in Colorado. He had emigrated from the Vojvodina. I think Toth was
                    originally a Hungarian-Yugoslav. The day that Ford came to Yugoslavia, a special
                    day it turns out, Toth was arrested, and I had little doubt, as I learned this
                    happened, that it was done by people in the secret police, in UDBA, who were
                    hostile to Yugoslav-U.S. relations, and therefore it was hardly an accident. He
                    was arrested on that day. He was alleged to have engaged in espionage because he
                    had taken pictures of machinery in a sugar factory. The sugar factory was one he
                    had worked in. The machinery was bought on the open market from West Germany. It
                    was absurd on its face. And I took it as reflecting a very aggressive posture on
                    the part of the Yugoslav police and a big shock. He was able to communicate with
                    me - he was a very shrewd fellow, and he figured a method of communicating with
                    me. I don't know how he got these documents, these tiny documents, out. And I
                    got the most heart-rending notes from him to the effect that I know I'm only a
                    recently naturalized citizen and therefore not as important to the United States
                    as somebody who has many American Ancestors, but nevertheless I'm a loyal
                    American and I wish help as much as possible. It turned out - I did not know
                    this although I suspected the worst - that he was arrested because UDBA had
                    asked him to spy on Yugoslav immigrants in the United States and report to UDBA
                    concerning Croats or others who might be hostile to the Yugoslav r�gime. He
                    refused. And that's why they put him in jail. We didn't know that, but we knew
                    that the reason why they were holding him was ridiculous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get consular access to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: No, because the Yugoslavs were taking the position, since he'd been
                    born in Yugoslavia, they would not recognize his American citizenship, which, of
                    course, infuriated us even more. This thing came to have enormous importance in
                    American-Yugoslav relations because I and my consular officer, Lowell Fleischer,
                    made it of significant importance. I took the fact that he had been arrested the
                    day Ford was there I took to be a reflection of forces within Yugoslavia that
                    wished to act in a fashion of relative contempt for the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a real slap in the face.SILBERMAN: It thought so,
                        and I thought it was essential that this, amongst a number of other actions,
                        be taken by the United States as the slap in the face that you just
                        suggested it was and we should slap back, but hard. So I put increasing
                        pressure on the Yugoslav Government with, I must say, the resistance of the
                        European Bureau. They kept cautioning. They kept saying, “Well, you can't do
                        this. You know, you can't jeopardize American-Yugoslav relations over this
                        one individual. And I kept saying, you know, it's not just one individual.
                        This is reflective of a broader problem we're having in Yugoslavia, and it's
                        the right issue to make a stand on for a whole host of reasons. Well, the
                        Yugoslav Government was increasingly irritated by the pressure that I was
                        imposing, and they were complaining in Washington. And The Wall Street
                        Journal Washington Wire, in the spring of '76, carried a little piece, which
                        as an insider in Washington I understood full well it's meaning, which was
                        that Laurence Silberman, ambassador to Yugoslavia, who formerly had a
                        distinguished record at Labor and Justice, was causing needless difficulty
                        in Yugoslavia and was not doing a good job. Something to that effect. Well,
                        I knew what that came from - either Sonnenfeldt or Hartman or somebody close
                        to Kissinger. I was sure it didn't come from Eagleburger, and I was pretty
                        sure it didn't come from Kissinger. On the other hand, I could see where
                        Kissinger would think, What the hell's Larry doing about this fellow Laszlo
                        Toth? Although the cable traffic made it perfectly obvious what I was doing,
                        but I could see Kissinger being a little bemused by all of this or at least
                        not sure. And certainly either Sonnenfeldt or Hartman leaked that to The
                        Wall Street Journal in Washington. So I insisted on meeting with Kissinger
                        in Paris. I forget why we were in Paris. He was in Paris for another reason,
                        so I met him, and I said, “Listen, I'm perfectly willing to resign. If
                        you're not backing me, I'm out of here.” And Kissinger said, “No, no, I
                        don't want you to resign.” And he said, “Look, if you're having any
                        problems, you should talk to Larry Eagleburger.” I didn't totally trust
                        Henry. I couldn't imagine that that leak to The Wall Street Journal wouldn't
                        have come from either Sonnenfeldt or Hartman, and Hartman was a career
                        appointee, who wouldn't have done anything without Kissinger's knowledge.
                        And Kissinger knew I knew. I think, to tell the absolute truth, that
                        Kissinger - you would wonder how in God's name would an ambassador be
                        capable of dealing with Kissinger this way - but remember, I had some
                        political ties, significant political ties, to Ford and others, and I think
                        Kissinger always was a little nervous about what I knew as deputy attorney
                        general.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also there's the fact, too, that... I mean, I looked
                        at this case just when I was getting the newspaper, and I heard these
                        things, and as a consular officer trying to get my superiors sometimes to go
                        to bat for somebody who was in jail when I felt they really shouldn't be in
                        jail by a foreign government, and found the reluctance, because there's
                        always a base or there's always an agreement or something and it's just
                        inconvenient. I thought it was right on, and it's the sort of case that if
                        it was spelled out in the press, the American people, you might say,
                        couldn't help but support the idea that the individual was more important
                        than detente, or what have you.</hi>

                <p>SILBERMAN: That is true, of course, and I have to say that while this struggle
                    was going on, which I was fighting as a two-front war, with the Yugoslav
                    Government on the one hand and my own government on the other, or the European
                    Bureau, against me, or the State Department against me, I did get significant
                    and important support from The New York Times and The Washington Post. The
                    chiefs of both, Malcolm Brown from The New York Times and Dusko Doder from The
                    Washington Post-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -who is an old Yugoslav hand, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. Both of them were completely supportive of me, which of course
                    drove the Yugoslavs nuts as well as the State Department. But it was an
                    important factor in that battle. Well, Toth was important as a single American
                    no matter what, but I would not have made the fight as strongly if I didn't
                    think it was consistent with American foreign policy objectives across the
                    board. In other words, he would always have been important, but in my view, it
                    was consistent with our general policy towards Yugoslavia - i.e., we shouldn't
                    let them think they could push us around. We should not let them think - this
                    was what I kept saying in cable after cable - we should not let them think that
                    good relationships with the United States were more important for us that they
                    were for them - that as long as they saw the United States as of the view that
                    good relations were primarily our concern, they would take advantage of us and
                    we were being fools, and it was counterproductive. But remember I had been
                    deputy attorney general, and an American in jail for no good reason was
                    something that upset me and I couldn't avoid it; but I had to constantly think
                    to myself, Look, am I being self-indulgent? Am I fighting for one American
                    against the interest of the United States? And I had to think about that
                    constantly and worry about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you say you fought the Yugoslavs? How did this take
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I put enormous pressure on them. Eventually, I cut off all meat
                    sales from Yugoslavia to the United States military. I don't remember how I did
                    that, but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a big deal!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That was an enormous amount of money. I cabled Bill Simon, who was
                    Secretary of Treasury and a friend of mine, to oppose IMF funding for
                    Yugoslavia. I cabled Frank Zarb, who was energy czar to make a speech in which
                    he made reference to this American in jail. So the Yugoslavs were under enormous
                    pressure. And of course, I was driving them nuts, and they would pressure the
                    State Department to in turn pressure me, but after that meeting with Kissinger
                    in Paris, the State Department was no longer - certainly the European Bureau was
                    no longer - in a position to try to pressure me. They Yugoslavs came close to
                    PNGing me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's declaring you persona non grata.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right, but they really didn't dare do that because they knew that the
                    State Department would be obliged to PNG their ambassador here in response, and
                    perhaps the publicity that would result from that would not be favorable. But
                    what they did do, which was rather amusing, was they came up with various
                    devices to threaten me - physically threaten me. You know, they would have
                    reported through our CIA that people meeting in a cafeteria were overheard
                    plotting to assassinate me, and they actually caused a ruckus when we were down
                    in Dubrovnik, which scared the hell out of my little daughter. There was
                    supposedly somebody escaped from jail who was looking to cause me trouble. I
                    never gave that any significance whatsoever because in a communist country the
                    government has a monopoly on the terror, so I knew that was just a device to try
                    to unnerve me and get me to leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was your analysis and that of your staff that this
                        was still the security agency - the Yugoslav UDBA, the Ministry of the
                        Interior - calling the shots as opposed to, say, the Foreign Ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Oh, I had escalated this to the point where there was no question this
                    was being decided by Tito. It was inconceivable that Tito wasn't making those
                    decisions. And I always took it to be a battle for Tito's mind, and you see
                    there's a principle in dealing with the Yugoslavs, or the Serbs, which you,
                    having been there, know. They love to say that pressure doesn't work on them.
                    The important principle to keep in mind is that inadequate pressure never works
                    on them. But enough pressure... And when both the meat sales and the IMF funding
                    was a problem, they finally gave up, and I think it was in June of '76 that they
                    released Toth, and then I got to meet him at the airport and find out precisely
                    what happened. And I really felt so wonderful about it because when I found out
                    that he was put in jail because he refused to work for the secret police in the
                    United States, I really felt this was a fellow who was worth fighting for.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In talking to Mark Palmer, we've reached that point. I'm
                        still doing it. He said he supported you and pushed you and, not pushed you
                        but supported you, all the way until the very end at the airport, and you
                        made a speech, and he felt that was wrong - not a speech, but a statement -
                        in other words, that you sort of rubbed the Yugoslavs nose in the dirt on
                        this one, if I recall correctly. Do you recall this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I did make a statement at the airport, and I think he's right about
                    that. He probably did disagree with it, but I to this day think I was right
                    because, sure, it rubbed their nose in it a little bit, but it also made the
                    potential prospect of their doing anything like that again even less likely. I
                    mean it made the pain even worse. Now I think from Mark's point of view, in
                    terms of his relations with the Yugoslavs, dealing with them, he probably
                    regarded that as problematic because they would have been really furious about
                    it. But from my point of view as a political appointee who's there for a time, I
                    was delighted to make sure the pain was good. In other words, I thought they
                    should pay a good price for that, including a good public relations price. So I
                    disagree. I disagreed then, and I disagree now, and I think it much less likely
                    that they would have done it again, or other countries would do that.</p>

                    before we move on.</p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I was thinking about what we discussed last time and refreshing
                    my memory. Had I told you that when The Wall Street Journal piece appeared and I
                    pitted all my efforts to pressure the Yugoslavs to release Toth that I tendered
                    my resignation, and that was the reason why Kissinger asked me to come and meet
                    with him in Paris?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure if you went into that in any detail. Why
                        don't we go back to that. We can always cut it out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right, and this leads up to the meeting with the press after Toth went
                    out. When I read the piece in Washington Wire, it occurred to me that that could
                    well be Kissinger suggesting that he disagreed with my efforts to make a major
                    issue out of Toth. After all, I got Bill Simon to put pressure on the Yugoslavs
                    by threatening their IMF loans. I, so-called, cut off the Yugoslav meat sales to
                    the U.S. Army. I was making a major issue out of it for the reasons that I
                    described earlier, which I thought a fit confluence of our concern about an
                    American citizen who was naturalized as well as our concern about Tito's
                    perception of our being weak in the aftermath of Vietnam. But it occurred to me
                    that that very well could reflect Kissinger's view, in which case I wanted to
                    leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just part of the Washington game, and Kissinger was adept
                        at this, was-SILBERMAN: Those kinds of leaks into the press, and
                        particularly The Washington Wire of The Wall Street Journal, which is always
                        rather a significant place for the news people on The Journal, as opposed to
                        the editorial people on The Journal, to plant tidbits. And I told you that
                        Kissinger asked me to come to Paris and disavowed any comments. I demanded,
                        which was rather presumptuous of me, that he put something out regarding
                        that. He disclaimed his ability to do that - which I didn't totally believe.
                        But in the event, he made the point, as I think I told you last time, that
                        henceforth if I had any difficulties I would deal directly with Larry
                        Eagleburger, the under secretary, with whom I was rather close, and to
                        obvious dealing with Arthur Hartman, who was the assistant secretary for
                        Europe. I want to make that point because I think I forgot when I talked to
                        you before that I actually went so far as to tender my resignation at that
                        point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>At the airport, the issue on which Mark Palmer and I disagreed then and disagree
                    today-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when Toth was leaving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: And why I gave an interview to The New York Times and The Washington
                    Post. Actually, I'm thinking hard about what I told you the last time. I gave a
                    slight misimpression because, as a matter of fact, through all the months that I
                    was working hard to get Toth released by imposing enormous pressure on Tito and
                    the Yugoslav Government, I did my best to keep that out of the papers. And Dusko
                    Doder was the bureau chief of The Washington Post, Malcolm Brown for The New
                    York Times - both of them knew about, had picked up information about my
                    efforts, and I persuaded them both to keep it quiet while I was doing my best to
                    get them out, because I knew publicity at that stage would be
                    counterproductive.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would put the Yugoslavs' backs up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Right. So to a certain extent I had an obligation with both of them to
                    give them the story after Toth was released. But secondly, I - and here is where
                    I firmly disagree with Mark - to have permitted the Yugoslavs to have kept Toth
                    in jail for 11 months, not only for no good reason but for an absolutely
                    terrible reason - the reason that he told me about at the airport, that he
                    refused to work for UDBA in the United States - would in my notion have been a
                    betrayal of American interests, because it would have allowed the Yugoslavs to
                    get away with something - that is to say, keeping Toth in jail for 11 months -
                    and pay no price. The publicity that resulted when I told the story to The New
                    York Times and The Washington Post gave Yugoslavia a black eye, which is exactly
                    what they deserved, and made it much less likely that any other American,
                    naturalized American, was going to be arrested in the future. And so I
                    reiterate, having thought about it clearly, the point that I felt at the time
                    that it was the right thing to do at that point to tell The New York Times and
                    The Washington Post what happened, to make sure the Yugoslavs suffered somewhat
                    of having made Toth and the United States suffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I mean, this is sort of the normal yin and yang
                        of diplomacy. Do you make your point and really stick it to them now, or do
                        you consider, We've got to keep working with these guys. And these are
                        judgment calls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That's right. But it is also true that I would not have done it if I
                    had been a career Foreign Service officer, which is Mark's vantage point. After
                    all, Mark was thinking of the prospect of coming back to Yugoslavia some day. He
                    ended up as ambassador to Hungary, and when you stick it to the Yugoslav
                    government like that, there's no way you're ever going to come back as
                    ambassador. I had not the slightest concerns about that, and frankly thought
                    that was a comparative advantage I had as a political appointee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when one looks at this, there are instruments of

                        people.SILBERMAN: Exactly. Political appointees had a comparative advantage;
                        Foreign Service officers have a comparative advantage. I was using my
                        comparative advantage there. Now, subsequently, I didn't tell you, but the
                        Yugoslavs did everything in the world to try to force me out, including
                        various threats to my life, which I never took seriously because the
                        Yugoslavs had a monopoly on terror.</hi>

                <p>SILBERMAN: But I think you should know, if I didn't tell you the last time, there
                    was one lawyer who represented dissidents in Yugoslavia, who had been a colonel
                    in the partisans in World War II for whom I had a great deal of respect and whom
                    I would occasionally see at parties. He was, I thought, invulnerable because of
                    his World War II background. But I was told, after I came back from my post time
                    as ambassador, that after he attended a Christmas party, a goodbye party for me,
                    a couple of months later he was killed on the highway between Belgrade and
                    Zagreb under circumstances suggesting that he was assassinated, which made me
                    feel terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, yes. Well, talk about the labor side of matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: The ILO affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what this is about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Sure. You may recall that back in 1974 or '75, '76, Pat Moynihan was
                    ambassador to the United Nations. He'd come there from India. I don't recall
                    exactly when. And Pat believed strongly in ideological confrontation with the
                    communists and saw the UN as a major stage for that kind of battle. Kissinger,
                    always somewhat uncomfortable with ideological matters, increasingly became
                    hostile to Pat. You may recall, of course... I think I told you about the
                    Sonnenfeldt Doctrine and my- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you just go back just a touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, I was mentioning that I was more sympathetic to Pat's approach to
                    the UN and his general strategy of ideological confrontation of the communists
                    than I was with Henry Kissinger's reluctance to fight on that battlefield. I
                    think that came from Kissinger's background from Europe and I think fear,
                    distaste, for ideological matters, and his primary concern for balance of power.
                    I think he saw ideological confrontation as rather messy and undisciplined.
                    Well, the AFL-CIO was the leading institution in American society that believed
                    strongly in the importance of ideological confrontation with the Soviets, and
                    that had played out on the ILO stage. Now you know the ILO was a part of the UN
                    but actually antedated the UN. It goes back to the Treaty of Versailles, and it
                    has a tripartite structure, organizations of employers, unions, and governments.
                    I told you about my involvement with the ILO as solicitor of Labor. The AFL-CIO
                    was increasingly aggravated by the United States's (what it thought was) supine
                    and less aggressive (less aggressive than they thought was appropriate) stance
                    in the ILO, just as they were sympathetic to Pat Moynihan's more aggressive
                    stance in the UN. And the issues were virtually the same. The AFL-CIO, as the
                    largest component or the most powerful component in the Democratic Party at that
                    time, was continually threatening to cut off congressional appropriations to the
                    ILO, the American participation in the ILO. And as that came more to a head,
                    Kissinger, anxious to avoid that break, which had obvious implications for the
                    United Nations - that is to say, those people who were anxious to have the
                    United States withdraw from the ILO were also talking about the United States
                    withdrawing from the United Nations, or at least causing a lot more trouble in
                    the United Nations than Kissinger thought was worth the candle. In any event, a
                    grand compromise was suggested, at least as a temporary expedient. And I'm sure
                    this was Kissinger's idea, which was to form a Cabinet committee to deal with
                    the ILO problem - a Cabinet committee that would, unusually, include George
                    Meany as the president of the AFL-CIO and more for symmetrical purposes than
                    real purposes, the head of the Chamber of Commerce and the Secretary of
                    Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of State, I guess the NSC
                    advisor, and the President. This committee was to formulate policy on the ILO,
                    and their first task, their first objective, was to commission a special envoy
                    of the President to go round to all of our allies, industrial democracies, and
                    tell them that if they did not support us in a more aggressive stance in the ILO
                    we would withdraw, and we were deadly serious. There was a discussion then as to
                    who would be the special envoy that could be trusted by all of these warring, or
                    these several warring, factions. The AFL-CIO congenitally distrusted Kissinger.
                    Their first choice was Pat Moynihan. Kissinger was apoplectic about that, given
                    the intense tension that had developed between Moynihan and Kissinger. Meany's
                    fallback position was me. Although I had not been public as Moynihan had, Meany
                    knew my personal views were not all that dissimilar to Pat Moynihan's views. And
                    Kissinger, I assume, thought that as Meany basically put it that... Oh, let me
                    stop for a second. The original argument was, Meany didn't want anybody from the
                    State Department as the special envoy. Kissinger demanded that it be somebody
                    subordinate to the Secretary of State because this was after all a major foreign
                    policy matter. Then Meany went to Moynihan. Kissinger dinged that. And Meany's
                    fallback position was Silberman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: - ambassador to Yugoslavia. I think this was in the winter of '75-76.
                    And so I am notified that I am to take on another task as special envoy for ILO
                    affairs while I am ambassador to Yugoslavia. Now what was interesting about it
                    was that as ambassador to Yugoslavia, I was constantly struggling with the
                    Yugoslavs concerning their leadership of the Nonaligned, which caused no end of
                    grief for the United States in various multilateral fora. As special envoy in
                    the ILO affairs, I was taking a position which couldn't have been more contrary
                    to the Yugoslav position, but it was consistent with my general job, which was
                    to try to do everything I could to dissuade the Yugoslavs from taking so-called
                    nonaligned positions but which were really very close to the communist views on
                    a full range of matters. So I was commissioned by the Cabinet committee. I was
                    notified by Scowcroft I think it was, as NSC advisor, that I was to be the
                    special envoy. I had to go down to Greece, as I recall, to talk on the phone,
                    because the cable traffic was inadequate to discuss it at great length. And then
                    I went off for various trips, interspersed with my time in Belgrade. In other
                    words, I would take off for three or four days and go to London and then to
                    Paris and then to Bonn and to Rome, and basically all of our allies, including
                    Australia, Japan, Canada, and so forth. And I went round everywhere and gave the
                    message, which was (a) I represented everybody in the American political
                    spectrum, the Republicans and the Democrats. It didn't matter what happened in
                    then next year's election. Our position was quite firm about this, and if our
                    allies wished us to stay in the ILO, they had to support us on these messy
                    ideological issues which they would prefer to sweep under the rug. I had some
                    really wonderful meetings. I met with the prime minister - was he foreign
                    minister or prime minister at the time - of Great Britain, Callahan, and I met
                    with him, and as I came into his office, the head of the TUC, which was
                    left-leaning and hated Meany, was quite obviously and ostentatiously going out
                    of his office, so Callahan was telling me, in effect, that he had already been
                    primed by the very people who were going to oppose my pitch the strongest. And
                    we had a rather contentious session. I think the minister, the DCM in London, a
                    good fellow by the name of Spiers, who was also a Dartmouth man-</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Ron Spiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And later became ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, ambassador to Turkey, I think. Elliott Richardson, I think, was
                    ambassador at the time. He was out of town, so he was back in the States. So Ron
                    accompanied me, and Callahan said at one point that I sounded like Moynihan. Now
                    you recall that Ivor Richard, who was a representative from Great Britain in the
                    UN, and Moynihan had had serious clashes, and at one point Ivor Richard had
                    given a speech in which he referred to Moynihan, implicitly, as reminding him of
                    King Lear raging across the moor. You may recall that, which to say the least
                    was an unfriendly act. But there was a good deal of suspicion that Callahan and
                    Richard were au courant with Kissinger in their criticism of Moynihan, which is
                    part of the reason why I emphasized to everybody that I represent both the
                    President of the United States and the most important constituency within the
                    Democratic Party. In other words, I was representing a broader array of politics
                    in the United States than actually Kissinger represented. In any event, Callahan
                    said to me I reminded him of Moynihan and I sounded like King Lear. And I
                    remember telling him, my response was, “Well, if you wish to use Shakespeare as
                    your analogy, I would prefer Henry V, 'We few, we happy few, this band of
                    brothers' - trying to appeal to the democratic allies.” He was not sympathetic.
                    I had gained more sympathy with some other members of the British cabinet. Well,
                    I had every reason to believe that Callahan was on the phone with Kissinger on
                    that as well, and Kissinger may well have been giving a message that was
                    slightly different from what Ford wanted given.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say, I run across these things of Kissinger
                        undercutting his own people. He did it to George Vest when he was working on
                        the Helsinki Accords and other times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Same issue, the ideological questions. Yes, yes, I know. But I had no
                    illusions about Henry, and as I said, I made clear to foreign governments, and
                    they had reason to believe that I was not bluffing, that I represented a broader
                    array of politics than Henry did in the United States. Well, I think I made some
                    progress, but the moment Ford lost the election, the allies - the Brits, the
                    French, the Germans, the Italians - thought, Oh, boy, this is going away now,
                    and they forgot what I told them about the AFL-CIO, and sure enough, Andy Young
                    became ambassador to the United Nations, we had no special envoy on the ILO, and
                    our policy basically on these kinds of efforts shifted 180 degrees, because Andy
                    Young was far to the left of Moynihan on these questions. As a result, the
                    AFL-CIO became infuriated and did withdraw us from the ILO by cutting off the
                    appropriations. We were out for a couple of years. Then the allies realized that
                    they'd better-</p>

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Who, the allies? Oh, they cared desperately because they saw it as a
                    precursor to an American withdrawal from the United Nations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this, in a way, for them was the issue more than the

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Sure. Sure. The ILO was always a mini-UN issue. And there was a good
                    deal of concern in the United States about the United Nations, and in fact, my
                    personal view was for a long time that the United Nations, on balance, was a
                    greater harm than good to American foreign policy. That changed with the
                    collapse of the Soviet Union. But it explains why... To jump ahead for a moment,
                    in 1980 I was co-chairman of Reagan's foreign policy advisors, and after the
                    election was asked if I wished to be UN ambassador by Dick Allen, who was the
                    national security advisor, and I turned it down flatly, telling them my view is
                    you should never take a job with a government that you don't believe in. I
                    recommended Jeanne Kirkpatrick.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: The ILO bureaucracy? The ILO bureaucracy was very hostile to my
                    efforts and worried about my efforts. My objective was in part to influence the
                    ILO. Well, no it wasn't. My primary objective was to get the allies to stand
                    with us. It didn't matter whether we were outvoted. It didn't matter whether we
                    ultimately achieved a major change of the ILO. What mattered to us very much was
                    that the industrial democracies in the world stood with us on these ideological
                    questions. In the long run, we, I , was confident we would prevail. But it was
                    very important to prevail, and the Soviet Union would collapse, one way or
                    another, but it was very important that we hold together that coalition, on
                    ideas as well as bayonets. And so that's what this was about.</p>

                <p>SILBERMAN: No, actually. They knew what I was doing, and it was quite consistent
                    with the kind of positions I was taking in Belgrade concerning the Nonaligned.
                    One of the issues that was most aggravating... Did I tell you about the Korean
                    incident? I did. One of the things that was most aggravating was the Yugoslav
                    efforts to bring question of our colonialization of Puerto Rico up in the United
                    Nations, and when the Yugoslavs would raise that, I would say, “Well, that's an
                    issue I think, if we want to take up that issue, we ought to talk about whether
                    or not we ought to free Croatia.” And the Yugoslavs would go nuts. “You can't do
                    that!” I said, “Well, then don't talk about our internal affairs.” My view in
                    dealing with the Yugoslavs was totally reciprocity. I never believed in
                    patronizing them, but whereas the European Bureau's notion was patronize,
                    patronize, patronize, appease, appease, appease; if they kicked us in the groin,
                    I felt we should kick them back double hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, because at the time, the overriding thing in
                        Yugoslav foreign policy was to keep the Russian bear from coming at them,
                        and they couldn't afford to do too much to their one support unless their
                        one support turned soft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: That is correct. You see, my fundamental view, and this is where I
                    disagreed with the European Bureau, Hartman et al, was that I thought it was
                    more than likely that Yugoslavia would be stiffened vis-�-vis the Soviet Union
                    if we were tough as nails, if they were afraid of us, if they had respect for
                    us. The more they thought we were weak and, as I told you before in the
                    aftermath of Vietnam they really did think we were weak, the more they thought
                    we were weak, the more they were inclined to get closer to the Soviet Union
                    rather than the other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find some of the other places, like Canada and
                        France and all? How were they?</hi>

                <p>SILBERMAN: The foreign ministries of all of these countries were, if not hostile,
                    certainly skeptical of this effort. The labor ministries tended to be different,
                    with one exception, as I recall. There was one country in the world that was
                    totally au courant with us, or with the policy that I was expressing, and that
                    was Australia. The head of their trade union there, who subsequently, I think,
                    may have become prime minister - I can't recall his name now - Peacock, who is
                    the ambassador here now, was the foreign minister - but the head of the trade
                    unions there was very close to Meany in his views and regarded these ideological
                    issues as terribly important. And of course the Israelis, who are often at the
                    receiving end of the nonaligned attacks, were wholly sympathetic to our view. As
                    I recall, France was sort of ambivalent. Callahan was sort of hostile. The
                    smaller countries in NATO were a little bemused or puzzled. The Italians were
                    ambivalent. I remember one meeting in Denmark where I was waiting to meet with
                    the prime minister and I was delayed for a few minutes and he came out quite
                    apologetic, and he explained, “I've just had a crisis,” that day, because a
                    Warsaw Pact plane - I think it was a Polish Plane or several planes - had
                    encroached on Danish air space, and I asked him, “Why didn't you shoot it down?”
                    And he said, “Well, that would be very risky.” I remember thinking to myself
                    that that was not a particularly good sign. I spent much of my time thinking
                    about NATO's response in the event of a problem in Yugoslavia, and I generally
                    grew to hold the view that NATO was a United States-German alliance with British
                    bands, and the smaller countries, the Scandinavian countries particularly, or
                    some of the other smaller countries, were simply a weak link. We should never
                    depend on them if the balloon really went up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else we should discuss about your
                        time in Yugoslavia, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think we've fractured it, haven't we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and if there is anything, you can put it in. Well,
                        then, you left Belgrade when? I mean, this is the end of the Ford
                        Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I left after the election. I think it was in January of 1977. To tell
                    the truth, I was determined to resign January 20th, 1977, because I did not wish
                    to serve for even a moment under President Carter. I had been not unsympathetic
                    to Carter during the election. I remember Lane Kirkland, the number two in the
                    AFL-CIO and a friend of mine, once said to me at dinner, “How can the country go
                    wrong with a Naval Academy graduate who's a peanut farmer from Georgia?” And I
                    said, “Well, you know, you make a good point,” but during the campaign, as I
                    recall, Carter made several indications in a speech that he would follow a line
                    that he subsequently expressed in a speech at Notre Dame, that we have this
                    inordinate fear of Communism, which was very troubling from my point of view.
                    And that came up during the campaign, and I really wanted to get out. Because I
                    didn't agree with Carter's foreign policy, and I thought he was going to make
                    big mistakes in foreign policy - which he turned out to make - and I wanted to
                    be out of there. I didn't want to serve under him.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're concentrated obviously on foreign affairs, but
                        what did you do when you resigned as ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I spent a year at AEI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the American Enterprise Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Someone once told me that during the years in government you draw down
                    all the intellectual capital you've built up, and you need some time to
                    refurbish it. I wished to do that before I went into law practice or whatever I
                    was going to do to make sure my family lived in adequate comfort and I could
                    send my children to college and so forth. So I spent a year at AEI, in which I
                    wrote various articles and lectured in various universities and colleges, and
                    two of those articles dealt with foreign policy. One was an article in Foreign
                    Affairs and one was an article in Foreign Policy Magazine, the latter focused on
                    Yugoslavia, particularly... I also wrote a piece for the Wilson Quarterly, on
                    Tito. But I also wrote in the areas of law and economics and so forth and had a
                    lot of fun. And then after a year of that, I agreed to be part-time counsel to a
                    law firm, part-time at AEI, and then agreed to do it full-time, managing partner
                    at Morrisson and Foerster in Washington, and then a year later was drafted by
                    its largest client to executive vice-president of Crocker Bank, which I spent
                    four years at, helped sell the bank to Midland, then went back to Morrisson and
                    Foerster in Washington, and from there was appointed to the bench in 1985.</p>
                <p>Now, in terms of foreign policy, and as I told you, in 1980 I was co-chairman of
                    Reagan's foreign policy group and was briefly head of the CIA transition after
                    the election, for about a couple of weeks and then got out because the
                    transition seemed to me a time when most people were jockeying for jobs, and I
                    wasn't all that interested in coming into government, although I truthfully
                    would have agreed to be CIA director, which was being discussed. But Casey, who
                    wanted first of all to be Secretary of State, but since he couldn't be Secretary
                    of State, wanted CIA director, and so he got it. He had a greater claim,
                    although I thought it unwise to put a campaign chairman in that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it turned out that it played to the wrong
                        responses in that person. I think both it turned it political and I think it
                        was an unfortunate appointment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Could be. In any event, the only positions I would have been
                    interested in in the Reagan Administration would have been CIA director or
                    Attorney General, and Bill Smith - he was a good friend of mine - had an
                    overwhelming claim for that. So I went back after the transition, and went back
                    to Crocker Bank, and I was appointed to the GAC, the General Advisory Committee
                    on Arms Control. And we did, I think, some interesting work for a three-year
                    period as an advisor, ultimately leading to a meeting with the President, Ronald
                    Reagan, in which Don Rumsfeld and I, an old friend of mine, impressed upon him
                    the indisputable fact that the Soviets were violating almost all of the arms
                    control treaties. I remember that meeting vividly because George Shultz was
                    quite upset that we were meeting with Reagan and telling him that. He didn't
                    want that message given. Don Rumsfeld and I were in some respects two of his
                    closest friends, and so it was quite interesting that we would be the ones to
                    push to tell Reagan this. We tried to trap Reagan into a recognition that they
                    were violating the treaties and that that had a direct implication on present
                    negotiating on arms control treaties. It was my job to tell Reagan over and over
                    again in the simplest terms that it was no answer to say that we would insist on
                    verification on new treaties, because we already knew they were violating the
                    old treaties, and verification would just allow us to determine they would be
                    violating new treaties. I remember putting, after we met for some time, in terms
                    of the policeman and the judge, that if someone commits a crime, it's hardly an
                    answer to the commission of a crime that you put more policemen on the street to
                    try to prevent them from committing new crimes. You have to act, and that's when
                    I got an incredible sense of Reagan's discipline and that he was perhaps a lot
                    smarter than I thought. Because after that careful explanation that Rumsfeld and
                    I gave him and the others around the table, he looked me right in the eye and
                    then said, “That's why we're going to insist on verification in the new
                    treaties.” And I was looking right in his eye, and I'm convinced that he didn't
                    give a damn whether I thought or Don Rumsfeld thought he was an idiot. He was
                    not going to be trapped into the framework that we were trying to trap him into
                    because politically he didn't have an answer. Nor did George Shultz. He didn't
                    want to tell the American people that the Soviets were violating all the
                    treaties, because the constituency for arms control was just too powerful in the
                    United States. So he didn't care if we thought he was an idiot or dumb, and he
                    was playing us. Basically, he just had that capacity and enormous discipline to
                    hear something and then just compartmentalize and shut it off. That 's when I
                    got a sense that he was a hell of a lot smarter than I had even the remotest
                    suspicion of, and I had spent a lot of time with him during the campaign of 1980
                    talking about our national security matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give a feel for the foreign affairs advisory
                        committee during the campaign? Not just with the President, but also the
                        people around him. Were there tides, currents going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Of course. The three people who were working full-time on the campaign
                    on the national security side were Dick Allen, who subsequently became National
                    Security Advisor, Fred Ikl�, who became under secretary of Defense, a brilliant
                    intellectual, and Bill Van Cleve, who was a professor, I believe, at Southern
                    California, a very hard-liner on defense matters. Now there were a number of
                    people who were on the advisory committee. Fred Ikl� and I were co-chairmen. He
                    was full-time, and I was part-time, on foreign policy. Van Cleve co-chairman
                    with somebody else on defense. John Lehman was involved. Jeanne Kirkpatrick was
                    involved on occasion. There was one big meeting of the advisory group back in
                    Washington with Reagan and Bush, but that was more ceremonial. There were
                    several meetings at the Los Angeles airport motel or hotel, in which I appeared
                    once with Dick Allen and Bill Van Cleve, and we went over for a three- or
                    four-hour session in which we went over all sorts of national security issues
                    that would come up during the campaign. And my recollection is George Bush was
                    present along with Reagan for the first meeting. He wasn't present at the second
                    meeting. I was in the midst of negotiating the sale of Crocker Bank, and so in
                    both of these meetings I would occasionally be called out to talk to one of my
                    subordinates or one of the law firm teams with the transaction, and I was
                    thinking to myself that maybe some day I would think that I would have to leave
                    these meetings to deal with this prosaic matter of the sale of Crocker Bank when
                    someone who might well be president of the United States was being briefed on
                    important issues. And there was one occasion which you might love, on the first
                    meeting at the motel. Each one of these meetings took all day, and obviously we
                    would talk about issues that we thought would come up in the campaign with
                    foreign policy implications. One of them was about the Mideast and Reagan's
                    desire to come out with a position that we would recognize Israel's right to put
                    the capital in Jerusalem, which was an issue I kept trying to talk them out of
                    because of its obvious foreign policy implications. But he had a very strong
                    emotional commitment to Israel, which I think came out of his movie experiences.
                    But there was one occasion in that motel which I shall never forget. Reagan
                    excused himself at one point to go to the bathroom, right in the suite, in the
                    room, and then came back, and he smiled. And I was astonished because two of his
                    teeth were missing. What he had done was take one of those kids little black
                    things that you could put on your teeth to look like your teeth were knocked
                    out. It was such a fresh and sophomoric thing to do, I was sort of
                    thunderstruck. Then we went back to a rather serious discussion. The second
                    meeting that took place in that motel, maybe a month later, Dick Allen was again
                    present, although he was in and out. I spent the entire time, except when I ran
                    out to take messages on the sale, alone with Paul Nitze and Gene Rostow, and I
                    recall in that meeting at one point Ronald Reagan asked a question which I
                    thought was very perceptive and very good. The question was, “How do we gain
                    leverage on our NATO allies? How do we pressure them?” Well, both Nitze and
                    Rostow almost went up like rockets because they were so committed Europeanists,
                    alliancists, after all being there at the creation of it. I, on the other hand,
                    to their disgust, encouraged Reagan to do it. It thought that was an important
                    question to try to think about how you got leverage over the NATO allies to
                    support us, to help us, or to take a tougher, more forward, position on some of
                    the problems, which it turns out we had, which was, for instance, the
                    zero-option in the missiles that we wanted to put into Germany that was so
                    crucial, in hindsight, in ending the Cold War. I will tell you that in the first
                    meeting, in which both Reagan and Bush were present, I reached the conclusion -
                    come to think of it, maybe there were three meetings, two with Reagan and Bush -
                    but on one of the meetings with Reagan and Bush, I came back and told my wife
                    that I had known George Bush for a long time, but Reagan had a longer attention
                    span.</p>

                        particularly troubling to you, that either you felt that the Carter group
                        could be bringing up or that Ronald Reagan might have, like the Jerusalem
                        stand or something like this, I mean, during the election?</hi>

                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, there was one interesting little assignment that came from
                    Reagan for me through Dick Allen. There was a good deal of interest and concern
                    about Nicaragua and Carter's position on Nicaragua, and a banking group in
                    Central America, focused one particular thoughtful banker from Guatemala, asked
                    the Reagan campaign if they could send someone down to Central America to
                    develop contacts and also to make an appraisal for Reagan as to what was going
                    on in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Salvador. And I was asked to do it, particularly
                    since I was a banker. It made sense. It was a nice cover, although the embassies
                    were told we were coming and I did meet the ambassadors there, the Carter
                    ambassadors, and I was rather careful. My major task was to report back to the
                    Reagan campaign as to my perception as to whether the Sandinista Junta were
                    communist or not, were they Marxist-Leninist? And the fact that I had been
                    ambassador to a communist country in which ideology was terribly important
                    seemed to qualify me to do that. I spent a week down there in Salvador,
                    Guatemala, and Nicaragua. The most interesting part was an almost full-day
                    meeting with the Sandinista Junta, in which they tried to get me to talk about
                    practical accommodations, the kind of things that if Reagan became president
                    they were going to do. And I, of course, explained to them that as
                    representative of the candidate I was not in any position to say anything about
                    what would happen if he became president. That was inappropriate. I was there
                    just to listen and understand them. And then I would ask them a lot of questions
                    about doctrine, which utterly mystified them. It was my view that after a
                    discussion about doctrine, I would know whether they were Marxist-Leninist or
                    not, and that that was probably more important than knowing how they were
                    prepared to accommodate on this or that tactical question. And I came back and
                    reported, as I recall, that Ortega and Hassan and one other fellow were
                    communists - young, immature, but communists, hard-core communists in the
                    classic Marxist-Leninist sense - and that two of them, Rubela and Cruz, were
                    not. I thought they were the classic fools, and sure enough, they did end up
                    ousted. So that was one issue on which I played a minor role but a direct role.
                    On the issues in the campaign, of course, the most important one was the hostage
                    crisis. And you probably know about that meeting at the L'Enfant Plaza that Dick
                    Allen... I was meeting with a group of advisors in Dick Allen's office and ready
                    to go to lunch, and Dick said would I mind joining him in another meeting that
                    Senator Tower and/or Bud McFarland, one of his aides, had arranged. They wanted
                    Dick to meet with somebody who had some information about the hostages, and Dick
                    was a little nervous about it and he wanted me, as an ex-deputy attorney general
                    to go along. And we went to that meeting at the L'Enfant Plaza. Bud McFarland
                    brought in this fellow who it turned out was a Malaysian. I thought he was a
                    Moroccan. I got it wrong. He was a Malaysian who claimed he had some Islamic
                    influence or contact with the Iranian Muslims and came up with the notion that
                    the hostages could be released to Reagan in the way to embarrass Carter, to
                    which, after he said that, I said we had one president at a time, and he got up
                    and walked out. McFarland brought this guy to the meeting. McFarland
                    subsequently apparently in the October Surprise investigation testified that he
                    can't remember anything but it was Tower and McFarland, I think, that clearly
                    came up with this idea and wanted Allen to meet with this guy. And Allen wisely
                    realized that there was something fishy in this. It was a fly-by-night
                    notion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of these. Unfortunately some of the
                        people in the government were susceptible to these people, and it later got
                        the Reagan administration in a great deal of trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, that's right, but you remember the October Surprise
                    investigation, which Congress actually started even though it was idiotic. It
                    was based on the suggestion that there was this meeting at the L'Enfant Plaza,
                    but the main theme was that Casey and/or Bush had made some secret deal and
                    secret trip to Paris to meet with the Iranians to try to persuade them not to
                    release the hostages. And I almost couldn't believe that anybody, including
                    members of the opposite party in the United States, would think that any
                    Americans would be so awful and disloyal. It's a testament of how much hatred
                    there is between parties in the United States, and also the bias of the press.
                    It turned out, of course, after the Hamilton Committee looked at it, to be utter
                    garbage.What else happened during that campaign? China became an issue briefly,
                    you may recall, how tough we were going to be on Chinese matters. There were a
                    few other things that came up.</p>

                    reappraisal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about grain? I mean, we had stopped grain sales
                        to the Soviet Union at the time, and this was an important constituency, the

                    remember it, but I can't recall what they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the foreign policy advisory team worked?
                        Sometimes these things are sort of ad hoc and the people coming have their
                        own ideas without the discipline of having a real job and the other one is
                        of a certain amount of staking out the claims to high policy jobs. I mean
                        this is not... I'm just asking because it's a generic problem, and you're
                        kind of the outsider on this. How did you find this particular grouping of
                        people worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I thought it worked really well up through the election. The
                    transition I thought was awful, because it was all show-and-tell and elbows and
                    trying to gain jobs, and I wanted to get the hell out of that. Dick Allen did a
                    very good job of disciplining the campaign foreign policy and national security
                    advisers. Fred Ikl� was and is a first-class intellectual. And Bill Van Cleve
                    was very good, too. So I thought during the campaign it seemed to work very
                    effectively to me. It was the only Presidential campaign I'd ever been involved
                    in, so I had no basis of comparison. And occasionally the candidate, Governor
                    Reagan, would say something that would cause our stomachs to tie into knots, but
                    he had a refreshing candor that allowed him to say certain things. I guess the
                    two most important issues were the Iranian Hostage Crisis and our perception
                    that Carter had been snookered by the Soviets. That he'd started out complaining
                    about an inordinate fear of Communism, and by the time of Afghanistan realized
                    that he was dealing with an implacable foe who wasn't interested in the
                    left-wing Democratic Party's views of convergence. Carter had pretty much
                    bifurcated his Administration, in that he had allowed domestic policy to be made
                    by more conservative Democrats, starting with Burt Lance, which was why the
                    Kennedy challenge, whereas his foreign and national security policy,
                    particularly foreign policy, was more or less delegated to the left wing of the
                    Democratic Party. And that's the way he balanced the two wings of the party. But
                    I think that vision ended up causing him trouble on both fronts because, of
                    course, he had this raging inflation on the domestic front, and he had the twin
                    disasters of Afghanistan and Iran in the foreign policy field, both of which
                    suggested a weakness in American foreign policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I told you my friend Tom Stern said to ask you about the

                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: All right, now we're shifting ahead. Besides being on the General
                    Advisory Committee on Arms Control, and I should say more important than the
                    Carlucci Commission was something else I did for the first Reagan
                    Administration. I served on what was then a secret group called the Defense
                    Policy Board, formed by Fred Ikl� and Cap Weinberger. And the reason why it was
                    secret, it turns out, is that they were deathly afraid of the Federal Advisory
                    Committee Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: FACA, which is a statute which requires, subject to certain
                    limitations, that the minutes of a Federal Advisory Committee be available to
                    the public. Now, Weinberger and Ikl� formed a group right after the election of
                    advisors on strategic policy in the Defense Department. The individuals
                    included, besides myself, Albert Wohlstetter, who you of course know from
                    Chicago; John Deutsch, provost at MIT, ex-CIA director, but who had been under
                    secretary of something, I think it was the Energy Department, in the Carter
                    Administration, but was an au courant, hard-liner, perfectly comfortable in the
                    Reagan crowd. It also included Paul Wolfowitz, who was then at State Department;
                    Harry Rowen, who was at CIA, who was (the number two man or number three man at
                    CIA), a businessman by the name of Eli Jacobs; a few others. And this was a
                    group that mixed senior government people with private people with government
                    experience. We would come together once a month to deal with various strategic
                    defense issues, one of which was the Strategic Defense Initiative itself, but
                    there were a number of others. And I waived any consulting fee for that for four
                    years. In return for it I asked for only one thing. My son was a young naval
                    officer on a frigate out of Hawaii but primarily, at that point, in waters near
                    Russia and Japan, and he said the thing he wanted more than anything else in the
                    world was a navy pilot's jacket so when he stood watch he would be warm. So my
                    fee for four years' consulting was a navy pilot's jacket that was sent to my son
                    from the Secretary of Defense, to the utter astonishment of his captain and all
                    the officers of his crew.</p>
                <p>Then I had that, I had the GAC, the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control,
                    which as you may know is a presidential appointment confirmed by the Senate. And
                    then I also was... When George Shultz became Secretary of State, he set up a
                    small group which included Kissinger and myself, to advise them all on Mideast
                    policy, which ultimately led to my being special envoy on the Mideast in 1984
                    for a brief time following Rumsfeld. And he also appointed me as co-chairman or
                    vice-chairman of the Committee on Economic and Security Assistance, which was
                    designed to recommend an approach to security and economic assistance, both
                    structurally, in terms of the organization within the government, and
                    substantively, and Carlucci, I think, was chairman, and Lane Kirkland and I were
                    co-chairmen. One of the things I pressed in that area was the views of Peter
                    Bauer, P. T. Bauer. I am very much an opponent of resource transfers for
                    economic development from country to country. Bauer has for many years pointed
                    out that process almost always, invariably, hurts the country that receives it
                    because it grows a big enough government to receive the funds, which tends to
                    crowd out private sector development, and the enormous advances made by
                    developing countries to make them developed countries, like Taiwan, Singapore,
                    and so forth, all came about after they stopped taking foreign aid. So that was
                    one of the things I argued for, and I was not very popular in that gully. We
                    were also dealing with military transfers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about military transfers? So often these things end
                        up as being ambassadors particularly want to make the country where they're
                        assigned happy so a few more tanks or something like this. I mean, were you
                        able to put a skeptical eye on some of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, actually, I was more sympathetic to military transfers. It
                    seemed to me that in terms of cost-benefit analysis that tended over the years
                    to be more successful than the economic transfers. For instance, you may recall,
                    in Yugoslavia I was very anxious to enhance the transfer of military arms to
                    Yugoslavia, particularly arms that were designed to protect them against a
                    Soviet tank invasion, i.e., the TOW missile and a few other things like that -
                    for two reasons. Number one, I wanted them more capable of dealing with the
                    Soviets if the Soviets should come in, and number two, that tended to tie the
                    Yugoslav military to the U.S. military and therefore had obvious political
                    implications, which I thought very important. So I certainly wasn't hostile to
                    it elsewhere, although each one is a case-by-case determination. For instance, I
                    thought our military transfers to Israel had been much more important of the
                    United States and Israel than our economic transfers, which I think have been
                    generally harmful to Israel.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Yes, actually, I came on... The theory was that Don Rumsfeld was going
                    to do this for six months, and then I would do it for the next six months. We
                    were both dollar-a-year men. He remained head of his company, and I remained a
                    senior partner at Morrison and Foerster, to which I'd returned from Crocker Bank
                    here in Washington. I made one trip to the Middle East with Don, which was
                    designed to sort of pass the baton. It was after the disastrous Lebanese
                    debacle, particularly the blowing up of the barracks and our withdrawal from the
                    Lebanon - which followed, incidentally, as much as I love George Shultz, his
                    disastrous policy mistake of throwing the United States behind the
                    Lebanese-Israeli peace treaty, which was violently opposed by the Syrians and
                    which could not be sustained by those forces in Lebanon who wished peace. It
                    gave rise to a disastrous Syrian encroachment into Lebanon. I did make one trip
                    to Beirut with Don Rumsfeld at two o'clock in the morning from Tel Aviv by
                    marine helicopter to meet with Gemayel, the brother, not the original one who
                    was killed, and I came to the quick view that that was a weak lead. And I was in
                    favor of our pulling the marines out of the Lebanon, which George very much
                    opposed - that is to say, he wanted to continue to fight to hold onto what was a
                    declining position. My view, as I told George after the barracks were blown up,
                    and I came in just at that time, that there were really only two options. At
                    that point Don Rumsfeld was over in Beirut trying to orchestrate battleship
                    rounds landing amongst the hostile forces. Well, I remember telling George - and
                    Irving Kristol was the third person who he talked to besides Kissinger and
                    myself on Mideast matters - and on this particular time, Kristol and I were
                    present with him, and I told him that in the aftermath of the barracks blowing
                    up there were only two legitimate options of the United States. One would be to
                    go in, seriously, and hurt the Syrians to the point that they would be obliged
                    to withdraw. That would imply a significant use of military force and probably
                    an effort to either destroy Assad or his forces. Or else get out. Option number
                    two, stay in in some kind of half-assed way, which was going to be a disaster.
                    And George, I remember, that was the counsel of despair. He was very bitter
                    about George Bush, who having chaired the Cabinet committee while Reagan and
                    McFarland were out of town, decided to get us the hell out of Lebanon. Now I
                    think Reagan knew damn well what Bush was doing, but George was furious about
                    that happening without the President around and over his objection.</p>
                <p>Well, in any event, the bottom line was we got out of Beirut. Thereafter, I went
                    out with Rumsfeld, and our focus at that point was not Lebanon or even Israeli
                    issues primarily at all. Our primary focus was the Iran-Iraq War, which
                    incidentally it was our view that it was in the interest of U.S. policy if that
                    lasted 100 years, but what we were concerned about was Iran coming through Iraq
                    into Kuwait and into Saudi Arabia. And we did have one visit with King Fahd in
                    Saudi Arabia in which we did our very best to talk him into pre-positioning of
                    military equipment. We were less successful than Dick Cheney was some years
                    later in the Gulf War. At that time, the invasion of Kuwait tended to
                    concentrate his mind. But originally he was much more worried about Iran than he
                    was about Iraq, but not worried enough to allow pre-positioning.</p>

                <p>In any event, we made that trip. I did make one trip to Israel, and the primary
                    focus at that point was Israel-Lebanon. And then when we came back, I thought
                    the notion of having a special envoy to the Middle East did not make a lot of
                    sense. It somehow gave the impression to both the Arabs and the Israelis that we
                    had a greater interest in their achieving a peace treaty or peace negotiations
                    than they did, which was a mistake. And we were continuing this special envoy
                    just out of a political inertia, that we'd had one for some years, and we didn't
                    need one. So I convinced George to let me go and went back to my law firm. So I
                    think I spent about a month or so at the State Department there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you received your appointment to the bench
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: Well, I guess it was in late '84. I was asked by Bill Smith to do it
                    in November-December of '84, and then at that point it was processed through
                    '85. I think I was nominated in April and appointed November 1st.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else, or do you think this covers
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: I think we've got it all there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SILBERMAN: More than you needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no.</hi>
