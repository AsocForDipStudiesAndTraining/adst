                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To begin, when and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts on August 5, 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get a little on the family. On your father's
                        side, what do you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: On my father's side they are of French Canadian background, in Quebec
                    since the mid-17th century. My grandfather came to the United States in the late
                    1880's, moving south, not too far from where he grew up, into Maine and then
                    finally going to Lawrence, Massachusetts where he set up a very successful
                    photography business in the early years of the twentieth century. My grandmother
                    on my father's side was also from Quebec. My father was born in 1909, and in
                    1931 graduated from Boston College where he majored in French literature. He
                    spent a number of years in France in the 1930's as an English teacher and as a
                    graduate student at the Sorbonne, also studying French literature, where he
                    received his “License”, a French degree. These years were a fascinating time for
                    him, as each summer he traveled widely as a guide, observing first-hand
                    Mussolini's Italy and Nazism in Germany. In France he also met my mother, whose
                    name was Mary Marshall, from New York City, and who was studying French in Paris
                    at the time. Her family had been in New York for several generations, having
                    originally come from Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century. They left France at
                    the advice of the American Embassy on September 1, 1939. It was a good time to
                    get out. They sailed from Cherbourg and were married in 1940. My father enrolled
                    at Harvard for further graduate work, which is why I was born in Boston, and
                    then later taught at the Tilton School, a prep school in New Hampshire. During
                    World War II he was a civilian employee of the Army coordinating logistics at
                    the Port of Boston. Because he spoke several languages, he also interviewed
                    enemy prisoners of war. In 1945, we moved to Bliss, Idaho, where Dad was
                    superintendent of schools and my mother taught math and science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had your mother gone to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, she was a graduate of St. Joseph's College for Women in Brooklyn,
                    New York, and from there then went to Catholic University here in Washington for
                    her masters degree in French. And that's what prompted her then to go to France
                    in order to perfect her speaking, which is how she met my father. After
                    returning to the U.S., and prior to her marriage, she taught at St. Mary's
                    College in South Bend, Indiana, the women's college for Notre Dame University.
                    But in 1945 they headed out to Idaho. As I said, my father was superintendent of
                    schools there, in a potato growing town in southern Idaho and they stayed there
                    for a couple of years, but Dad always wanted to teach at the college level. When
                    an offer came from the University of Connecticut we moved to Storrs,
                    Connecticut. Then when I was seven we moved to Quebec City, Canada, where he
                    taught at Laval University, which is a French language university in Quebec
                    City. It was sort of carrying coals to Newcastle: to bring an American to teach
                    French literature in Quebec City. But for me, in retrospect, it was great. I
                    didn't know any French before that, but I went to school in French from the age
                    of seven through the age of eleven. I received a very solid grounding in French
                    grammar, composition, and the fundamentals of the language which have stood me
                    in very good stead to this day. I am totally bilingual.</p>
                <p>Q: As a kid, growing up, before you went to Quebec, how Quebecois was the family?
                    I mean, was there any carryover, the ties from your grandfather? . THIBAULT: My
                    grandfather had died before my birth, long before. I never knew him. We moved
                    around, as I've just described. So I can't really say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, anyway, it wasn't a predominant influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I grew up in a very Francophile environment, but my parents focused on
                    France, which they resumed visiting as early as 1950 or '51 and then traveled to
                    almost every year starting in the late 1950's. The first language I learned
                    actually was French. My mother spoke as fluently as my father. When we moved to
                    Idaho I completely forgot it. They don't speak much French out there. So it's
                    hard for me to judge, it's so long ago. And I'm not sure what Quebecois
                    influence is, 'til we actually went to Quebec.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from what year to what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In Quebec City? Let's see. From 1949 to 1954, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you considered an American at the school? Were you
                        sort of tagged as the American?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, yes, in part because of the school I attended. It wasn't merely the
                    school, although I remember arriving not knowing much French at all and then
                    later being congratulated for rapid proficiency. They had an annual school
                    event, something called distribution des prix, the distribution of prizes, at
                    the end of the first year, when I was in the third grade. I received a special
                    prize for my proficiency in French. But it was playing in the street, more than
                    anything else, with other kids who never let me forget that I was American. We
                    always spoke English at home so that we wouldn't forget our English. Oh, yes, I
                    was very well aware. And my parents and all my relatives were Americans, and we
                    would visit them in New York regularly. So we were very aware of our American
                    nationality. In fact, that was significant ultimately in my decision to apply
                    for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Catholic Church? How did that play in your
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, we were and are Catholic. It was a very strong influence. My
                    father is still living, he's 95. My mother died many years ago. So it was a very
                    formative influence in my upbringing, is the way I would put it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Quebec, Quebec City, did you feel the
                        pressure of the church or the influence of the church there, because the
                        church had been so influential in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there was influence. Pressure is too strong a term. And it was a
                    different age, a different era, in those days but its influence was very strong,
                    very pervasive, as I look back. I emphasize that I was quite young at the time.
                    But the school I attended was a religious school, run by an order of nuns and
                    later, for a year, I attended a school administered by an order of brothers. Had
                    we remained in Quebec City, I would have gone to a high school called the Petit
                    Seminaire, which is in fact the oldest school in North America, dating from the
                    1630's. So yes, I mean it certainly reinforced the influence I received at
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find, how'd you take to school life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, my parents were both educators. They placed enormous influence on
                    schooling, both of them. So you were expected to accept school as the thing to
                    do and they set high standards. I just find that a hard question to answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I have five brothers and sisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow! Where did you rank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in charge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I wouldn't say that, but I was the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than French, which obviously you took to, any other
                        subjects of particularly influence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, from my earliest learning how to read, history has always been a
                    passion of mine and from then until now archaeology and ancient history, in
                    particular, remain subjects of great appeal to me. So history, certainly. I read
                    very few novels or literature unless it was part of the assigned reading, but I
                    always read history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you were very young to be an activist, but did
                        you get any feel about the Quebec lib�r� or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was certainly exposed to a very strong sense of Quebec identity. As I
                    said, history was a particular favorite subject and the history taught there in
                    elementary school was very much the history of New France and of Quebec
                    province. So I certainly was exposed to that but in terms of the political
                    sphere or what became the Quebec Liberation Front of the 1970's or the
                    separatist politics of the Eighties, Nineties and even of today, no, I was
                    not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the school separated by sex?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I went to two schools. Both were separated by gender. Girls were in one
                    wing and boys were in another at the first school. And certainly the second one
                    was a boys' school, run by brothers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much at home did the world around you, events of the
                        world beyond what your parents were doing, was that a subject of
                        conversation at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Again, this was up to the age of, we left when I was eleven, the summer
                    I turned twelve, I guess, from eleven to twelve. I would say, given their
                    background, my parents were very internationally minded. Their horizons were
                    assuredly beyond Quebec province. We were Americans so we were very conscious of
                    what was going on. I can recall the Korean War and discussions we would have
                    about that. But at that stage I can't say we sat around the table discussing
                    world events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there at the age of eleven. Where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: We then moved, still in Canada, to Windsor, Ontario, which is an
                    automotive manufacturing city directly across from Detroit. The two cities are
                    separated by the Detroit River. My father was a professor of Modern Languages at
                    the University of Windsor, teaching French and Spanish language and literature.
                    He had received his doctorat es lettres, from Laval University, that is, a Ph.D.
                    In Windsor, I immediately entered high school, at the age of twelve, because the
                    system in Quebec was organized differently from what we are familiar with, in
                    the sense, at that time, that elementary and secondary school were each for six
                    years. I understand it has changed considerably since then. For those slated for
                    higher education in Quebec and with high aspirations, you followed what was
                    called the classical course, with a heavy emphasis on Greek and Latin and so
                    forth, that was six years instead of four. I had taken the entrance exams for
                    this next stage, had been admitted, and then we moved to Windsor. My parents
                    felt that I had finished elementary school, and that I well might as well go
                    into high school, even if I was a couple of years younger that my
                    classmates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Windsor must have been a completely different environment.
                        This was a suburb of Detroit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, well, different countries, but the industry is very tightly linked,
                    that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was within the Anglo sphere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Right, it was very much an English speaking, exclusively English
                    speaking, environment but as I said, we had always spoken English at home, so
                    speaking, reading, writing was not an issue. But in Canada your ethnic
                    background becomes - I don't know if you know anything about Canada, but at
                    least at that time and my guess is that it hasn't changed much - that one's
                    ethnic origins are a subject of comment and noted. And so you have that
                    awareness. So anyway, I was there through high school and I also attended the
                    local university, in all from '54 through '62.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that your ethnic background is something.
                        Coming from Quebec, did you find that this was an advantage, disadvantage in
                        Windsor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, Windsor, like Detroit, is an old French settlement dating from the
                    18th century and so there are many people there having a French background. They
                    don't speak French but they have French names. So there was nothing unique about
                    it. I'm simply saying that at that time in Canada, far more than in the United
                    States, if you were Ukrainian or Irish or whatever, you were this or you were
                    that, that people seemed to identify themselves and others in those terms. They
                    always commented about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we, I've heard again and again, they talk about
                        fostering and making ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: A mosaic, rather than a melting pot. That's the Canadian slogan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard that story again and again. They work at
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They do and their history is different, having the concept of “two
                    founding races.” So from the very beginning, the French element in Quebec, which
                    is in many ways the core of Canada, in historical terms, resisted assimilation
                    into an Anglophone model. If you start with that reality and have a
                    constitutional setup that recognizes and protects it, then certainly from that
                    flow the distinctions that people make about each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting your education in a foreign country, did you find
                        that, you've always been interested in history. Was the history you learned
                        when you later came back to the States, were there significant gaps or
                        divergences between what you learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, I wouldn't say that. There was a heavy dose of American history in
                    the curriculum that I took, both in high school and in college. We lived right
                    next door to Detroit. My mother taught French and Spanish in the public schools
                    of Detroit; she commuted back and forth. She was fifteen minutes away from her
                    school. It's just a river. It's like Arlington and the District. And of course
                    there is TV. - the Canadians complain that they're saturated with American
                    television. We watched all US news broadcasts and all the popular shows of the
                    period. I very distinctly recall watching the Army-McCarthy hearings at length.
                    Moreover, we were Americans to begin with and had no intention of remaining in
                    Canada. Of six siblings, only one has remained in Canada and she's the only one
                    who was born there. So, no, to answer your question, I didn't feel at a
                    disadvantage. Many of the textbooks were American, the subject matter, many of
                    the teachers were American.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, so you went to Windsor College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It's called the University of Windsor, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went there the full four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In Canada they have what they call an honors program beyond the regular
                    BA course work. At that time, you added an additional year. It was a five year
                    program. I took that. Now that was a period that was very formative for me. I
                    very well remember the year that I graduated from high school, the summer I
                    graduated. I was looking at the university catalogue and they had the different
                    majors listed and then they had a page there, which I thought and still think
                    was an excellent idea, listing possible career opportunities if you majored in
                    these subjects. I was interested in history and the catalogue mentioned Foreign
                    Service, among many others. That immediately lit a bulb and from that time on, I
                    knew exactly what I wanted to do. I had a goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any connection or knowledge of the American
                        Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, as it happened, Windsor had a U.S. consulate. In fact, someone
                    who became very well known in the Foreign Service was a young consular officer
                    there, Ambassador Nick Platt, and he was a student of my father's, brushing up
                    on his French and I probably didn't have more than one or two conversations with
                    him. But that encounter gave concrete form to the career concept that had gelled
                    with me. I knew I was interested in foreign languages, I was interested in
                    economics, in politics, in history. I knew there was an exam process. So the
                    subjects I figured would prepare me best for the Foreign Service exam were the
                    very subjects of interest to me. It seemed like a natural fit. In addition,
                    there was my parents' encouragement. However odd such a career might seem to my
                    contemporaries, it was taken as perfectly natural at home, given their own wide
                    travel which, I should add, continued in high school, even at Christmas or
                    Easter, when we would drive all the way from Detroit to various points in
                    Mexico. During the summer, in most years, they took student groups to Europe,
                    bringing the family with them. I usually stayed home, foolishly I suppose,
                    preferring to get a summer job. Passports, embassies and consulates were far
                    from alien to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get hold of any autobiographies or
                        biographies of American diplomats?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I could have. I took one or two courses in American diplomatic history
                    in college, but I didn't seek them out. As I told you, I knew exactly what I
                    wanted to do. That was a great advantage to me in that everything fell into
                    place. Because my goal was the very specific one of taking the exam, each
                    subject in college was assessed in terms of whether it would be useful to me or
                    not in qualifying. I was under no illusions about the challenge of competing
                    against people who had what I regarded as more prestigious or more favorable
                    educational backgrounds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were doing this, were you concerned that when you
                        appeared before a group of examiners, American examiners, would say, “Well,
                        you've spent most of your time in Canada. You may be of American parentage
                        but you've been brought up in a Canadian atmosphere.” Was that a
                        concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was a concern, not a pressing concern but I certainly thought about
                    it. But I figured the way to deal with that was to go to graduate school in the
                    U.S., which was what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, first I went from the University of Windsor, graduating in 1962,
                    to the University of Toronto. I had a very nice scholarship from the Government
                    of Ontario so I thought I might as well take it. I got my masters degree at the
                    University of Toronto in '63. From there I received a fellowship to go in the
                    fall to Philadelphia, to the University of Pennsylvania, to a PhD program in
                    international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, at Toronto, this is for your masters? What was your
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Again, it was history, an M.A. in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, it was a combination of courses and then of course a major paper.
                    The paper was on Anglo-American relations and the Indians in the late 18th
                    century.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about Indians, what Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Red Indians, Native Americans. Growing up around the Detroit area,
                    where there had been several Indian uprisings which are very much a part of
                    local history. Chiefs Pontiac and Tecumseh. In fact, a suburb of Windsor is a
                    little town called Tecumseh, Ontario. So in that whole area, there was great
                    rivalry between the US and Britain to secure the support or neutrality of
                    potentially hostile tribes. The Great Lakes area, on both sides of the border,
                    is dotted with fortifications that date from that period. There was a lot of
                    tension between the newly independent United States and the British forces in
                    Canada. So I did a paper on that subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you're off to the University of Pennsylvania. This is
                        for a PhD? Did you finish it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I came close but I did not finish it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you concentrating on when you were doing it?
                        What were you working on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, again, my goal there was ... you very rightly put your finger on
                    it a moment ago. How am I, a graduate of an obscure Canadian university going to
                    be competitive in taking the Foreign Service exam? So that's what encouraged me
                    to enroll in the international relations program, as opposed to political
                    science. I took a medley of courses in my first year, 1963-64. Unbeknownst to me
                    before I went to Penn, the university is one of the premier institutions in the
                    world in the field of South Asian studies. The first chair of Sanskrit in the
                    United States, way back in the mid-19th century, was established at Penn and
                    that heritage remains strong to this day. My point in mentioning this is that
                    there was a whole coterie of professors, whether of sociology or history or
                    political science or languages or economics, whose personal specialties, one way
                    or another, involved the Subcontinent. I became fascinated by the region and
                    very much enjoyed the courses that I took, and began reading extensively about
                    it. So that became an area of specialization and the area in which I wanted to
                    do my dissertation research, as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>In the meantime, I decided that I might as well take the Foreign Service exam.
                    That was my career objective and people had told me, “Take it as many times as
                    you wish. No harm in going through the exercise and seeing how you fare.” So I
                    guess it was in 1965 that I took the Foreign Service exam, maybe it was '66. To
                    my utter astonishment, I passed, including the orals, on my first attempt. That
                    still left me with a dilemma, because here I was in the middle of a PhD program
                    in which I had invested a lot of personal interest and time. After being
                    informed months later that I had cleared the security and medical hurdles, and
                    was invited to join a new Foreign Service class, I asked the Department for an
                    extension, there's a term for it. In the end I got two of them. In 1967, I
                    received a fellowship to study in India itself, having selected a topic to work
                    on and went off to India, to the Indian School of International Studies in New
                    Delhi. In the meantime I'd become engaged, having met my fianc�e at Penn where
                    she was also a graduate student. When in India it became clear that finishing
                    the research, writing up and defending the dissertation would take longer than I
                    had realized. I told myself: I know what I want to do, I've been accepted into
                    the Foreign Service, they've given me two extensions. How many more can I count
                    on? I'd better fish or cut bait. So I wrote back to the Board of Examiners that
                    I wished to be considered for the next class which would be formed about 12
                    months later. There was one class a year at that time. My fianc�e, Caroline
                    Whaley, came out to India and we were married in Delhi in July '68 with the U.S.
                    Consul as a witness. We returned to Philadelphia in January of '69, and then in
                    July of '69 I entered the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You recall any of the questions you had on the oral exam?
                        Did you get the feeling they were trying to look at how American you

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No. I never had that sense. My Canadian background, to be candid with
                    you, never arises. I rarely think about it. It's so long ago, it's never been an
                    issue with anyone, whether in graduate school, certainly not in the Foreign
                    Service. It's more a matter of curiosity than anything else. I never felt at any

                    questions were there and that I was obviously able to answer them. Who's to say

                    today whose grandparents were that. Her family is from the Charleston area. Her
                    father was an engineer and refinery manager for what then called Standard Oil,
                    now Exxon, outside New York City. The family lived in Westfield, New Jersey. She
                    graduated from Chatham College, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then from there
                    went to Penn, for graduate work in American history. That's how we happened to
                    meet. She later taught at Temple University.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: I went to New Delhi. My dissertation topic was on the role of All India
                    Radio in political development. Back in the Sixties, the concept of political
                    development was a major source of interest in theoretical elaboration for
                    political scientists and my supervisors at Penn were very much caught up in
                    that. But the focus on All India Radio was good, because I could do the research
                    in English but at the same time it was national in scope as opposed to being
                    very parochial and very regional. And it raised a lot of interesting issues
                    about national and regional identities, cultural policy, political influence on
                    radio broadcasts, these being the pre-television days. They were still very much
                    under the influence of those, even dating back to the Thirties, who considered
                    radio as a major molder of public opinion, as a major tool that could influence
                    rural people. It was subsequently proven not be to the case but at that time
                    there was a lot of faith in that. So it was an interesting topic and I traveled
                    widely to conduct interviews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a government, sort of BBC type</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yeah, in fact set up by the BBC in the colonial period but called All
                    India Radio. It still exists. So that was in New Delhi. In order to qualify for
                    an Indian visa, I had to be affiliated with an Indian educational institution.
                    Again, one of my supervisors had had longstanding relationships. He wrote to one
                    of his friends at the Indian School of International Studies and they sponsored
                    me for the educational visa and all of that had to happen. But once I was there,
                    I was pretty much on my own. I could conduct my interviews, go to the archives,
                    travel around the country, all of which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was your first real taste of India. How did you find
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, I enjoyed it immensely. I took to the country. The spell has never
                    left me. It still remains, as one can see, looking at my career path. So I
                    enjoyed the people, I enjoyed the intellectual challenge of dealing with India.
                    It was a very positive experience. Fortunately, my wife felt the same way. As I
                    say, we were married there. I had written to her, “In the Foreign Service, we'll
                    be living abroad. Here's an opportunity to come out and live and experience, see
                    how you like it before we make a final commitment to at least the Third World in
                    the Foreign Service.” Which she did and was, as I say, very positive as well
                    about the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, when did you come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: This was June '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, when you were in India, did you run across
                        sort of anti-American involvement in Vietnam, was that a factor, or were you
                        sort of</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, I can't say that it was a factor. I was there when both Martin
                    Luther King and Robert Kennedy were shot. The shock of these events was very
                    profound, especially regarding Dr. King who had been influenced by Gandhi and
                    thus had an intellectual link with India of which the Indians were very aware.
                    But I didn't feel any anti-American sentiment at a personal level. The
                    newspapers at that time and broad Indian policy statements were often very
                    critical of the U.S., but it never translated into any personal animosity or
                    distance. Far from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You started in '69. How would you characterize your basic
                        officer, your A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, this was at the time of the Vietnam War. I should mention, by the
                    way, in connection with that, that I was A-1 for my draft board throughout. For
                    some reason they never called me. I never applied for a student deferment. I
                    mention this only because the intake for the class was divided between 50 per
                    cent who came in under what you might call normal auspices, as I was, and 50 per
                    cent whose acceptance into the Foreign Service was conditional on accepting
                    their first assignment to Vietnam in the CORDS program. CORDS was an acronym for
                    ... you served in South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but I wasn't in CORDS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was a combined civilian military reconstruction and development
                    program. You'd be assigned to individual provinces at district headquarters.
                    There'd be a military officer and a foreign service officer and you would work
                    closely with the local Vietnamese administration, as a liaison with US military
                    and civilian assistance authorities, and keep tabs on the Viet Cong, presumably.
                    Several officers were killed in that program. Anyway, 50 per cent of us came in
                    under those auspices and then 50 per cent of us in the more normal way. So did
                    you have any other aspects of this in mind when you asked the question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I was just wondering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: There were women in the class and a couple of African-Americans, but we
                    were overwhelmingly white males. It was a geographically diverse group, I mean
                    from all over the country.</p>
                <p>I should also note that, unlike today's system, I came in already coned, that is,
                    I came in as a political officer, in the POL cone. All of us came in already
                    coned. Also unlike today when every new officer's first assignment is as a
                    consular officer, only those coned for consular work went out to do consular
                    work. The result is that while over the years I developed detailed knowledge of
                    consular operations, I never had a consular tour. I'm a great believer in that
                    first tour being consular, regardless of whether you move to other work, because
                    it exposes you to a key aspect of Foreign Service work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they give you much, I mean did you feel you could go
                        where you wanted or did you feel that you be picked up to go to
                        Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, as I said, 50 per cent of us were going to Vietnam. So,
                    implicitly 50 per cent were not. As I recall, there was a sheet on which you
                    could express your preferences. In my case, at some point during the A-100
                    program, the coordinator, a fellow by the name of John Day, asked, “How many
                    here speak French?” He explained that the officer paneled for Conakry had
                    resigned suddenly in protest of Administration policy on Vietnam forcing the
                    personnel system to reach into the incoming class for a successor. Now we had
                    not yet been tested on our language skills. Three or four of us raised their
                    hands. He said, “Ambassador McIlvaine would like to meet with you tomorrow,”
                    referring to Ambassador Robinson McIlvaine, who was ambassador to Guinea. We
                    were to meet with him, in what was, I guess the old FSI buildings, in Arlington
                    the next day but that fell through. And John Day says, “The ambassador couldn't
                    make it but he would still like to meet with you, only requesting that you meet
                    at his home.” And he lived over in Northwest, somewhere. So, a day or two later,
                    the three or four of us who said we spoke French filed through his home, which
                    was empty except for some orange crates. He sat on one and I on the other and we
                    spoke in French for about 20 minutes and the next day I was informed that I had
                    been selected to go to Guinea. I knew nothing about Guinea or Africa but at that
                    point in one's career and at that stage in life one doesn't argue much. You are
                    so excited by the prospect of going overseas. I don't know how long the training
                    course is today, but I came in mid-June '69, and by mid-September I was in
                    Conakry, with my wife. So that was the beginning of our Foreign Service
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Guinea at the time you got there
                        in'69?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Let me start by saying that, in many ways, Guinea was the most
                    memorable of my assignments, of all of the assignments I've had. It certainly
                    left vivid memories. Very briefly, Guinea was a West African country which had
                    been a former French colony. By political conviction and certainly to create, as
                    he put it, “the New Guinean Man,” and the “New African Man,” President Ahmed
                    Sekou Toure had established a socialist Guinea, creating all the infrastructure
                    of a Third World socialist economy and political order and society, to the
                    extent that he could influence social attitudes. The Party was everything,
                    meaning the PDG, the Parti Democratique de Guin�e, it was called, the Democratic
                    Party of Guinea. The Soviets had enormous influence, a huge embassy, as did the
                    Chinese who were their rivals. The Chinese had built the People's Palace in
                    Conakry, a large, very modern convention hall, which they staffed, because the
                    Guineans didn't have the technical expertise to maintain it. The East Germans
                    ran the security and intelligence services and were also very influential. So,
                    needless to say, the Western countries, including the United States, had cool
                    relations with Guinea. The number one whipping boy were the French, their former
                    colonial masters. Guinea had been the only colony in French West Africa that
                    had, in 1958, spurned post-independence association with France, a decision by
                    Sekou (as everyone called him) that infuriated De Gaulle. The French departed
                    abruptly, supposedly removing even the light bulbs as they exited. But, in
                    addition, the regime also had a phobia about NATO, especially the FRG, no doubt
                    reflecting East German inputs. So, West Germany, the United States, and France
                    were constantly being sort of pilloried in the country's one paper,
                    l'Horoya.</p>
                <p>That was the setting in which we arrived in September 1969. We did not have an
                    ambassador at that time. In fact, we had a succession of charg�s from the West
                    Africa desk who would come out of the Department for six or seven weeks, rotate
                    in and out. McIlvaine had left. I don't know where he went. He may have gone to
                    Kenya, but he had left. So actually I never did serve under him. Then we had a
                    fellow by the name of Bob Melone, who I believe later became ambassador to
                    Rwanda, who was charg� for quite a time, six months or so, but again brought in
                    from the desk. And then finally an ambassador arrived in the person of Albert W.
                    Sherer, Bud Sherer, a terrific guy, previously ambassador in Togo, but more
                    relevant to Guinea, he was an East European hand who had been DCM in Prague and
                    political counselor in Warsaw and was a navy guy from World War II. He had seen
                    and experienced Stalinist regimes close up for many years. We had a very small
                    staff. I was the reporting officer. I was econ, political and AID affairs
                    officer. I was what they called an FSO-7, a very junior guy. The country team
                    could easily have fitted around a table not much bigger than this one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about a table about the size of a door.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not very large, that's for sure. Yeah, about the size of a door. The
                    embassy was located in an old auto showroom. Guinea had been quite prosperous in
                    French days and Conakry had a gloss about it which had very much faded by the
                    time ten years had rolled around, after independence. We had a big plate glass
                    window downstairs where USIS was located. Upstairs was the executive suite and
                    some of the cubbyhole offices where we worked. So that was the American
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there, what, two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: A little over two years, from September '69 to December '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the United States, I mean this was the height of our
                        involvement in Vietnam. Were we castigated by this all the time? Was this
                        part of the motif there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, imperialism was a constant refrain. The North Vietnamese had a
                    large embassy present. They would often be brought out to a huge stadium that, I
                    don't know if the Chinese or whomever had built it, where they would be hailed
                    as the poster boys of the victims of imperialism. The atmosphere was incredible.
                    The stadium was packed. You had what my wife came to call the “Guinea cheer.”
                    You would have the president, S�kou Tour�, in his flowing white robes, often
                    flanked by his cohort, Kwame Nkrumah, who had been kicked out of Ghana. They
                    would circle about the stadium in an open Mercedes. Following the President's
                    lead, shouting into a microphone - “l'imperialisme” - , the crowd would chant “a
                    bas , “down with”. The President: le colonialisme; the crowd - “abas”. President
                    - “le neo-colonialisme”; crowd - “abas”. We must have attended two to three
                    dozens of such events at the stadium, to which the diplomatic corps would be
                    summoned with rarely more than a day's notice, often just hours, as announced
                    over the “Voice of the Revolution.” Like Fidel, Sekou could go on for hours,
                    seeking to whip up the “militants”, or party faithful who were supposed to be
                    the entire population, fully mobilized behind the Revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a reporting officer, were you able to get out and
                        around much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: My time in Guinea was very much divided into two phases. The first
                    year, until November 1970, you could travel about the country. We were under
                    tight observation and you had to have permission from the government in order to
                    leave the capital but people were relatively open. Africans are very friendly. I
                    spoke fluent French, so I had no problem in communicating. We reported
                    extensively on our interactions with the government and on events that we
                    thought were of interest to the Department. I am more cynical today of just how
                    much attention Washington paid to Guinea at the time, but I took it very
                    seriously. We had also a reporting list that was tasked from Washington and
                    there was only one reporting officer. So I reported on United Nations programs,
                    for example. AID had closed its mission and I had to monitor and report on our
                    residual programs, primarily PL 480. I also did economic reporting; for example,
                    there were bauxite mines, in which there was some U.S. investment. And I handled
                    the commercial work as well. And to the extent that Washington had any interest
                    in political reporting I did that as well. Mainly what the president was saying,
                    his pronouncements and how this fitted into West African regional politics and
                    the like. I was extremely busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the rest of the diplomatic corps? Was this a
                        sort of cohesive little group? I'm talking about the Westerners there.</hi>

                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, there were not many but we were all on friendly terms. The other
                    “large” Western embassy were the Germans, West Germans that is, mainly because
                    they were there as a counter to the East Germans. As a result of that, they ran
                    several aid programs and a large technical school as well, so they had some
                    people there. The French, of course, were not present. There were no relations
                    between France and Guinea. There were three or four Italians, the Japanese, the
                    Indians, Pakistanis, and a handful of other countries. There were surprisingly
                    few African diplomats, mainly because Sekou was at odds with all the
                    “collaborators” who had become associated with the French. We all knew each
                    other well. Again, I was very junior. I was a Third Secretary, but it didn't
                    prevent me from hobnobbing with ambassadors and more senior people in the dip
                    corps.</p>
                <p>Q; Was there a general feeling that Guinea was on a downward spiral because of
                    the socialist influence?</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: That was very clear. You saw no growth that was occurring. As I said
                    earlier, Guinea had been a relatively prosperous place before independence.
                    There was a large, I wouldn't call them French although they had French
                    nationality, Lebanese community. Throughout West Africa many of your trader
                    community were Lebanese and there were still a large number of them left in
                    Guinea. But there had been far more, plus French and other nationalities, before
                    independence. And they had left the infrastructure of a very nice colonial city
                    but you could see the decay and the projects that had come to a sudden halt and
                    the fact that only Soviet- and Chinese- funded projects existed. And most of
                    these were showcases for the party and Sekou, such as the People's Palace and
                    the stadium. Roads were abominable; there was no investment in the country. So
                    you certainly saw economic decline and stagnation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about you and your wife? Were you able to make contact
                        with the people? Or with sort of an East German influence, was that
                        available?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, my wife taught at the small American school which covered a number
                    of grades. She was one of three American teachers. The director was an
                    African-American woman who had been in Guinea for a number of years. Through
                    her, she was able to meet Guineans. As I said earlier, they were very friendly.
                    I can't say that we had a very large circle of Guinean acquaintances or friends,
                    outside of the government, because there were constraints there. But we were
                    able, certainly, to develop relationships, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was, I think I'm right, a period where many
                        American blacks were going after their roots, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, you had some, but not so much going after their roots. I mean,
                    the Roots TV series was after this. But you had so-called American
                    revolutionaries. Stokely Carmichael was in residence, African nationalists, if
                    you will. He was the most prominent of them in Guinea but there only a handful.
                    Stokely was a great buddy of our Bill Davis, our PAO, who himself was
                    African-American. Bill was an extremely effective officer. He had a very wide
                    selection of Guinean friends and buddies and Stokely would come to his house. As
                    I said earlier, this experience was clearly divided between pre-November 21,
                    1970 and post-November 21, 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's talk about November 21, 1970. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: On the morning of that day, which was the day after eid al-fitr, the
                    end of Ramadan, the ambassador got up. He always got up early. His house was on
                    the Corniche, or seaside road. Conakry is like a big finger, a narrow peninsula
                    that juts into the sea. His house was on the water, a few yards from a small
                    beach. He thought he saw activity on the horizon. Being an old navy man, he went
                    out and got his binoculars, looked again, now spotting a flotilla of warships
                    far out at sea. And then to his astonishment they began launching boats like
                    Boston Whalers which, as he watched, landed on the coast, some of them not too
                    far from the ambassador's residence. That was the beginning of an attempt by the
                    Portuguese, who were in neighboring Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau), to
                    overthrow the Tour� government. The reason for their hostility was that the
                    headquarters for the liberation movement for Portuguese Guinea was located in
                    Conakry and they had an enclave there. So they would maintain contact with their
                    people, being directed by their leader, Amilcar Cabral, who was a very
                    charismatic personality. Cabral was recognized not just as leader of the PAIGC,
                    the name of their party, but even in Pan-African terms as one of the great
                    African liberation leaders. The Portuguese then were under military rule. So
                    they launched this expedition to be rid of the PAIGC once and for all .</p>
                <p>I should tell you that we had one policy guidance from Washington, and I recall
                    being told this by the desk before I left Washington, to keep our contacts with
                    the PAIGC to the lowest possible profile. They didn't say not to have any
                    contacts at all, but to keep them at the very lowest profile, because at that
                    time, Portugal being a NATO country, we were in negotiations with them for the
                    renewal of our facilities in the Azores. They did not want to do anything to
                    upset the Portuguese. So for the Americans to go hobnobbing in any visible sense
                    with the PAIGC was not something that Lisbon, or Washington, would welcome. The
                    country team, in concert with the desk agreed that I, being the most junior
                    person and a Third Secretary, was disposable or, I should say, deniable. These
                    were very carefully calibrated and calculated forays and I'd meet Cabral and his
                    subordinates on the diplomatic cocktail circuit, because PAIGC representatives
                    would be invited by others. So I would chat with them, making sure that others
                    were present. Not surprisingly, they would always invite me to meet with them at
                    their camp outside the city. So in careful coordination with the Africa Bureau,
                    I was allowed to do that once or twice but it was a very sensitive subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>So to resume, on November 21, the Portuguese fanned out. In fact, to my
                    knowledge, they were overwhelmingly African troops. They began seizing strong
                    points and the fighting raged all day. I had left to drive overland for the
                    first time to Liberia a few days earlier. As it happened, I was returning from
                    Monrovia and entering Guinea that very day. I stopped at the border of Liberia
                    and Guinea at about two o'clock in the afternoon. The crossing point was in the
                    bush with nothing in sight but there was a border post and the road. While
                    looking at my passport and visa, the Guinean border official exclaimed, “Oh,
                    it's two o'clock. I must turn on the news from Conakry,” referring to the
                    regular two o'clock news broadcast. And immediately he did that, I could hear
                    the Voice of the Revolution describing how “our brave troops are fighting the
                    Portuguese, the imperialist invaders. The President of the Republic is at the
                    head of the valiant resisters. We are certainly going to drive them into the
                    sea.” Very inflammatory, very highly charged language. So the border fellow,
                    while very distraught and upset by the news, nevertheless allowed me to enter
                    Guinean territory. I hadn't gone more than about ten kilometers after picking up
                    my Embassy driver, who had been waiting because the Liberians wouldn't allow
                    Guineans into their country, when we rounded a bend and immediately were
                    surrounded by guys with their weapons drawn, all pointed at me.</p>
                <p>It was a police post. I was immediately asked for my papers which I showed them.
                    I said, “I'm a diplomat. You have no right to examine the car.” They said,
                    “Monsieur, we're at war! We have to search you and we're going to detain you.”
                    To add further insult to injury, from their point of view, they looked through
                    my wallet and they came across a calling card from a person I'd called on in
                    Monrovia. And he said, “Ha! You've been in touch with the Portuguese!” I said,
                    “What do you mean?” “It says right here! General Tire! Military man!” I said,
                    “No, that's the name of a company.” General Tire! Tire in French also means to
                    shoot. So I was really in the soup. I was brought under heavy escort to the
                    provincial governor, who was himself rallying the militants, as they called
                    them, the Party faithful, who were a sort of paramilitary force. Well, one of
                    the reasons for my trip upcountry had been to call on the new ambassador to
                    Washington, who happened to be this governor. We had had a very good
                    conversation on my way into Liberia. So on my way out of Liberia they bring me
                    to see him. We fell into each other's arms and then he brought me up to speed on
                    what was going on in Conakry. I was held there for about three days, at a hotel,
                    with a World Bank guy. The ambassador managed to get a message out to me, saying
                    my wife was okay and they were working with the government to have me flown to
                    Conakry. So finally, I did fly back to Conakry.</p>
                <p>What had happened was, as I say, the Portuguese had used some of their African
                    troops, who were abandoned on the beaches by Portuguese officers, their white
                    officers who returned to their ships. Presumably to add legitimacy to the
                    enterprise, the Portuguese gave it the cover of being a Guinean exiles' force
                    that had attacked and was seizing the town and was to overthrow the Toure
                    regime, but they weren't numerous enough, not strong enough, not well organized
                    enough, whatever. So the Guineans beat them back and finally pushed them back to
                    the sea, where many of them had fled. A lot were just shot in the water and a
                    number of them were taken prisoner. That's when the domestic purge began.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The president's view was the Portuguese would never have dared to attack the
                    bastion of African liberation, as he called Guinea, unless they could count on a
                    “fifth column” in the country, consisting of counter-revolutionaries, traitors,
                    spies and their collaborators. How would you know if someone was a collaborator?
                    Well, prime suspects were those who had had a substantive connection with the
                    French in the past, and there were a lot of former military people who had
                    served in the French army and, of course, many civil servants, teachers,
                    professionals, and businessmen. There was a whole class of people who, under the
                    French regime, had been part of that system. The huge purge that immediately
                    followed the aborted invasion rivaled the Thirties in Russia in its atmospherics
                    and organization and that's how we reported it to Washington. Day in and day out
                    for months you would have confessions on the radio: a monotone voice in which
                    people identified themselves and then described, in very elaborate terms, their
                    involvement in the complot, in the plot, and their collaboration with the
                    Portuguese. In fact, you'd recognize the voices of people you knew. I myself was
                    mentioned a number of times because I had traveled upcountry and stopped and
                    called on people. Here was an American NATO spy who, just before the Portuguese
                    attack, had obviously been coordinating their responses on the eve of the
                    attack. It all fell into place. It was also very sad. I can well recall one
                    morning driving into the embassy and seeing the bodies of a number of people
                    dangling from an overpass. And what's worse, they had brought buses of
                    schoolchildren and the families of those who had been executed, who were on the
                    road looking up, watching the bodies sway gently, while singing revolutionary
                    songs and shouting slogans in support of the president. We would visit
                    cemeteries to count new mounds in order to judge the death toll of the
                    purge.</p>
                <p>Amazingly, in spite of my alleged involvement, as publicly reprinted in Horoya, I
                    was not told to leave, the Ambassador was not called in, I continued my normal
                    activities with government officials. For the remainder of my time in Conakry,
                    another 12-13 months after the attack, the atmosphere was totally charged with
                    the purge, which went on week after week, month after month of bitter
                    denunciation of the West and particularly of the Germans, the West Germans.
                    Again, we didn't bear the full brunt of it but the West Germans did and again
                    I'm sure their East German cousins were behind that. Many non-official
                    foreigners were expelled. Any foreigner married to a Guinean who had been
                    arrested, usually a wife, was expelled with the children “to be raised by the
                    Party.” It was a very vivid experience, a very personal experience for me and my
                    wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American sort of revolutionaries, Stokely
                        Carmichael?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, they started packing pistols on their hip and wearing berets
                    mimicking Che Guevara in order to display their identification with Sekou and
                    the revolution. To give you a flavor of the regime, when the telephone would
                    ring, a Guinean wouldn't answer “Hello”; rather, you replied “Committed to the
                    revolution:” “Pr�t pour la revolution.” As a Guinean, you assumed your phone
                    line was monitored and you took no chances by being less than ardent in your
                    zeal. The revolutionary rhetoric was everywhere. As I say, we at the embassy
                    were not directly on the receiving end of the Guinean vituperation and of the
                    media attacks, or at least far less so than were the Germans. One reason being
                    that, a day or two before the attack itself the German foreign minister ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Genscher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, Genscher had visited Lisbon. That was proof positive that the
                    Nazis in Bonn were giving orders to their acolytes in Lisbon and, of course, the
                    East Germans were feeding this. Technicians at the German school, the German
                    funded school that I mentioned, which was a technical school, doing excellent
                    work, were all arrested. Ironically, many of the so-called Nazis were Israeli
                    citizens who were working under contract for the NGO that operated the technical
                    school. It took a long time before they were released. It was sort of like the
                    aftershock from an earthquake. There were incidents that would flare up
                    unexpectedly, months after the failed attack. One of them involved a bauxite
                    mine that was owned by Aluminum Company of Canada, Alcan, and Alcoa of the US, a
                    fifty-fifty venture. Roughly half the staff were Canadians and half were
                    Americans, meaning the expat technicians, maybe about 15 or 20 of them working
                    on a little island off the tip of Conakry, where there are bauxite deposits. We
                    got word that they had all been arrested and were being brought to court. The
                    ambassador immediately sent me down to the courthouse to find out what was going
                    on. I reached the prison like enclosure, getting there just in time to see the
                    truck pull out. They dropped the tailgate and the prisoners walked off the back
                    of the truck onto the top step of the courthouse and immediately were brought
                    into the courtroom. There was a judge sitting at a tribunal. The proceedings
                    lasted about ten minutes at most, in which, without ever making a statement,
                    they were all found guilty of antirevolutionary activities and marched out to
                    get back on the truck, with sentencing to be announced later. At that very
                    moment, a man came running in with a piece of paper, shouting at the top of his
                    lungs, saying, “Wait! Wait! Wait! The president has given them an amnesty!”
                    While he had sent me to observe, our ambassador, Bud Sherer, had gone to the
                    presidential palace saying all hell would break out in Washington if these
                    people weren't released immediately and that had had some effect. So they were
                    returned to the small boat, went back to the island, and by that afternoon they
                    were at their jobs as if nothing had happened. It was just a surreal
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The ambassador had good access to the top leaders. Many of the people around the
                    president, as is often the case, were much more reasonable to deal with. We had
                    a special relationship with the foreign minister, who before this had happened,
                    before the Portuguese attack, had been sent to either Bethesda Naval or Walter
                    Reed on some medical issue. I can't recall what it was. That was something we
                    used to do in those days, I don't know if we still do it. We would sometimes
                    arrange for local dignitaries in Third World countries, where they had
                    inadequate medical facilities, to have them sent to one of our military
                    facilities. They always were very grateful for that. But there was follow-up
                    treatment and the RMO, the State Department's regional medical officer for West
                    Africa was stationed in Conakry, because it had the worst medical facilities of
                    any of the countries in the region. So it was logical to place the RMO there. We
                    had an acting RMO who was the personal physician of Wilbur Hayes, I don't know
                    if you remember, the congressman ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yeah, he was the one was caught, went into the
                        pool</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The Reflecting Pool</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Fanne Foxe, who had a very large bust size</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: She was a foxy lady! Well, this doctor from the same home town as the
                    congressman was his great and good buddy and, I don't know why, but he often
                    would spend a little time in an embassy in Africa, filling in for an RMO who was
                    on vacation. He volunteered for that. Actually, he was a very decent guy and a
                    good physician. In Conakry, he provided follow-up medication and monitoring to
                    the Minister, invariably accompanied by a piqure ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Injections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Injections. The Africans absolutely believed that the piqure was
                    essential to sound medicine. So the ambassador instructed me, “Al, you go with
                    him.” The doctor didn't speak any French. “Go with him and try to pump him of
                    any information. Try and steer the conversation.” We'd work up talking points on
                    issues for me to raise with the minister while he was bending over, baring his
                    rump for the piqure. There was Thibault, trying to pump him of information! What
                    a place!</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Anyway, this atmosphere of terror continued for the remainder of my tour there.
                    The security measures that were then put in place were notched up, ratcheted up
                    to an incredible degree. You would have checkpoints on major roads every 200 or
                    300 yards and these young kids at night, armed with AK 47's in Party uniforms
                    and armbands would stop you as you were coming home from someplace. They would
                    see you stopped down the road, at one checkpoint, and yet would stop you at
                    another. They weren't asking for money. It wasn't a shakedown. They just wanted
                    to see your papers. We soon learned that those from “brotherly countries” always
                    seemed to be waved through. The Russians, the Chinese, the Algerians, you name
                    it and they always were “people's democracies.” So I soon learned that they
                    would ask me, “Who are you? Show your papers.” I would say, “I'm from the
                    People's Democratic American Republic.” (It sounds even more impressive in
                    French!) “Thank you!” You'd be waved right through. As I told my colleagues,
                    “We're popular, elected by the people, democratic, a republic. The People's
                    Democratic American Republic, why not?” Better that than to have one of these
                    kids loose on the trigger or something.</p>
                <p>So we would be following this unfolding process, comparing notes. In the embassy
                    itself, we had radio duty, because Horoya was only published once a week and it
                    was just a rag. Yet, the president was constantly to be heard on the radio. All
                    information, most announcements and summons to the People's Palace for chiefs of
                    mission, were all conveyed via the Voix de la Revolution, by radio. You had to
                    be tuned all the time, especially at night. So we would assign our team, our
                    staff, those who spoke French, to radio duty. It was scheduled, assigned duty
                    and you'd report back to the country team the following morning. So the nine
                    o'clock news would come on, and then go on forever. The president was like
                    Fidel. What was worse is that he or his ministers would first speak in French
                    for a time, and then their remarks would be translated into one or two local
                    languages, after which the French broadcast would resume. So it could go on at
                    great length. Very often I would set up a tape recorder, like this one. We had a
                    servant, whom I told, “Michel, it's your job to turn this on at nine o'clock.” I
                    would have to come home at eleven or twelve, or whenever, and with pen and paper
                    listen to this a couple of hours, taking notes to see if there was any nugget
                    worth reporting to the country team the next day. What a place!</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>What was interesting too, a reflection of very different times compared to today,
                    is that security was a post responsibility. You didn't have a regional security
                    officer on the Embassy roster, you didn't have an RSO. I don't think the
                    position existed; it certainly didn't exist in Conakry. To the extent that
                    security issues arose, you were asked to apply common sense without much
                    specific guidance. Washington was very relaxed about this. When the Portuguese
                    attacked and there was much shooting all over the place, we were all at home. I
                    was out of town but everybody else was at home. My wife and I shared a house
                    with the CDC's measles/smallpox program officer and his wife, a duplex. They all
                    sought refuge in an interior room without any walls. When I came home the ground
                    was littered with brightly shining copper shells. The Guineans had been shooting
                    wildly seaward, in case the Portuguese decided to land on our side of the
                    corniche. Having served many years later in Saudi Arabia and in India, when
                    security was a big issue, let me tell you the reaction, the institutional
                    reaction, was very different thirty years ago from what it is today. Nobody was
                    called home, no evacuation of dependents, no sending out of teams, no security
                    review, no accountability review boards, no Mylar for windows, no moving to a
                    secure location, and of course no concern then with an attack on a diplomatic
                    facility and no concern then with suicide or other car bombs, or with any of the
                    threats that are felt so immediately today. I mean it was a very different world
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there ever any consideration of getting
                        Americans out of there, the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, and we had all our dependents with us. It never occurred to
                    anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that, here you have an economy in a
                        downward spiral anyway and if Tour� is going after all those with
                        essentially foreign connections, foreign training, he's just gutting the
                        ability of the country to work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Right, I agree. That's exactly what happened and in fact what that
                    resulted over time in was a tremendous exodus of Guineans to neighboring
                    countries, particularly to the Ivory Coast. When we were there, when I was
                    there, I mean if there was one paradise on earth, it was Cote d'Ivoire, the
                    Ivory Coast and particularly Abidjan. And of course the president's great
                    target, in terms of his own personal vituperation on the radio, was
                    Houphouet-Boigny, the president of Ivory Coast, whom he would denounce
                    vociferously. Now they had all known each other and worked very closely with
                    each other in pre-independence days. And Houphouet led the movement by all of
                    the French colonies, with the exception of Guinea, to remain in economic
                    alliance with France. At that time, they had a West African franc which was tied
                    to the French franc, so it was considered a hard currency. Of course, Houphouet
                    had the famous wager with Nkrumah: Ghana became independent in '57, Ivory Coast
                    in '58, who in ten years would have progressed the most in economic terms, each
                    following different paths? I think within six months it was clear who was going
                    to win that one, and it wasn't Nkrumah in Ghana. So Ivory Coast acted as a
                    magnet, as did, to a lesser extent, Senegal, where Senghor was the president.
                    And again, Senghor was one of these, in Tour�'s language, one of these
                    collaborators and “running dogs” of the French. The fact that the French sort of
                    bolstered their economy, subsidized it to a large extent, to a point where the
                    standard of living there was much higher than in Guinea, attracting all of these
                    Guineans, just was rubbing salt into the wound, as far as Tour� was concerned.
                    Or S�kou, I should say as everybody called him S�kou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any aid programs when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not really, no. In fact, that's why my title was political, economic
                    and AID affairs officer. The AID program had been closed down before my arrival.
                    We had one TCN, third country national, a Greek fellow, and I was the officer
                    supervising him. He was maintaining the individual program accounts. That is,
                    there were loan agreements in which the Guineans were obliged to make certain
                    payments, but we had no program per se, with the exception of the measles/
                    smallpox eradication program which was operated out of CDC in Atlanta. This was
                    a West African program in which we had teams consisting of an American with
                    locals, aiming at eradication of measles and smallpox. They were very
                    successful, as we know, particularly with smallpox. That was the only AID
                    program that I can recall along with some minor PL 480 activity. I can't
                    remember if it was Title I or Title II sales. But that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we monitoring what the various Soviet bloc people and
                        the Chinese were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, of course we were monitoring them, absolutely. I won't go into the
                    details of that, but yes, that was an issue of interest to us. Not only in terms
                    of individuals, as intelligence targets, but in terms of what they as
                    governments were doing in Guinea and as a part of a larger pattern of what they
                    were doing in Africa. So, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to sort of pick up the feelings of the time.
                        Was there concern, now I realize you were a very junior officer, in your
                        first post and all that, but were you picking up the feeling that we were
                        really concerned about sort of the Communist Bloc being on the move in
                        Africa and taking over things? Or were you seeing this as a miserable
                        failure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I think both, in the sense that we certainly saw it as a miserable
                    failure. On the other hand, there was a concern that S�kou Tour�, as a very
                    charismatic leader, might be a Trojan Horse for the Soviets. Nothing I have said
                    about him begins to convey a flavor of the man's personality - someone who
                    filled a room by his sheer presence, a very powerful speaker, a very engaging
                    person, if you were to meet him one on one, as I observed him on a number of
                    occasions. He was a very handsome, highly charismatic man. He was one of the
                    icons of radical opinion in Africa. So to the extent that he could reach out to
                    Africans, I think this was a subject of concern. In fact, of course, as I and
                    others could readily see, Sekou's appeal was diminished by the utter failure of
                    the Guinean economy and the steady exodus of Guineans to neighboring countries.
                    At that time, of course, we were concerned with the stability and the long term
                    future of pro-Western governments in West Africa but the feeling was that this
                    was primarily a French issue. They had priority in trying to shore up their
                    presence and their influence in the countries that had once been under their
                    domination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were sort of, in a way, in the wrong place for
                        this but there had been, particularly during the late Fifties and the
                        Sixties almost hysteria in approach about Africa being the shining hope. All
                        sorts of things were going to happen. Were you getting anybody who had been
                        around more, sort of a dying down of this feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, this was, of course, the Nixon Administration time and, no, just
                    getting them to pay attention was always a challenge. We did have one visit
                    then, though, by the assistant secretary, David Newsom, who came out. He was
                    very well received by S�kou, who brought him to his private home, to his country
                    retreat, so to speak. But, no, I don't think there were any illusions about what
                    we could achieve with Guinea, particularly with Guinea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've heard stories of S�kou Tour� who threw people
                        sort of basically in jail and maybe not even feed them or anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there were these stories, absolutely, many of them well
                    documented. Many of the people who were imprisoned in the wake of the Portuguese
                    attack died there. Those who came out of it said they were very ill-treated.
                    Sekou died suddenly in 1984, at the Cleveland Heart Institute, and within three
                    or four days the whole edifice that he had built up, around the Party,
                    particularly of the Party, collapsed. What seemed so strong and permanent was
                    all built around one man.</p>

                    were a people who were ill-served by their government; given their many
                    qualities, they deserved a far better government. The universally held opinion
                    was that, left to themselves, the Guineans would be very, very different,

                        caught.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there was very little to be corrupt about, to begin with. And of
                    course, as a diplomat you're shielded somewhat from this. The Party controlled
                    what meager resources were available. Foodstuffs, for example, were distributed
                    through Party channels, through what they called comites, committees, at the
                    local, even the block and village level. Access to education, medical care, all
                    of that depended on your standing with Party officials. How this was
                    administered, how this was managed, I don't pretend to know in detail. In
                    addition, there were different ethnic groups as the Guineans are a compound of
                    different ethnicities and the Peulh, from the northern part of the country, had
                    been opposed to S�kou Tour�, who was a Malinke, in the pre-independence period.
                    So there was a widespread feeling that he didn't trust them and that they
                    suffered as a result. The foreign minister I mentioned himself was a Peulh, or a
                    Foulah, another word they used, but he was a symbol. Most of the people in the
                    regime were Malinkes, as was the president.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Gaddafi come into power by this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He was in power. He came into power in '67 or '68. I don't recall any
                    Libyan involvement there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other country, other than the Portuguese, messing
                        around there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, other than the Eastern Europeans I've already mentioned. Guinea
                    does not occupy a strategic location. It's got large bauxite deposits, but
                    that's about all. So it doesn't have much to offer, to make it worthwhile. You'd
                    have to have a political objective in Guinea which, surrounded on all sides by
                    countries that had rejected the Guinean approach or model, didn't really mean
                    that you obtained much traction. It wasn't any beachhead, it was more like a
                    retreat. They were into survival mode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nkrumah play any particular role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He was visible, he was certainly visible, and he was often invoked by
                    S�kou, but no, I don't think so. His fate in Ghana certainly made S�kou doubly
                    aware of plotting around him or the potential for plots against him,
                    particularly by the army. Which is why he relied so heavily on the Party as
                    opposed to the army. But no, in terms of internal decision-making I don't recall
                    Nkrumah playing much of a role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he play up to this non-aligned business, travel around
                        a lot or stay pretty much to home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He stayed very much at home. He traveled very little. I think the
                    feeling on our side was that he was afraid a coup might occur during his
                    absence. Nkrumah was overthrown when he was traveling. So he stuck to home. In
                    fact, he traveled very little outside of Conakry itself. So, as I say, I think
                    Nkrumah's example influenced him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I left in December '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I then went to Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, so you're getting down to the Subcontinent.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I, there's a story there, too, because the ambassador to Sri
                    Lanka, a fellow by the name of Robert Strausz-Hup�, had been my professor at
                    Penn. I had written to him asking if there was a spot in his team. He wrote back
                    to say no, that staffing was complete. I get to Washington and I walk into the
                    personnel officer, who later became a good friend of mine, Howie Schaffer. And
                    Howie says, “What are you doing, meddling in the assignment process?” I asked,
                    “What do you mean?” He said, “Strausz-Hup� specifically asked for you. We had
                    somebody else who was about to be paneled. We don't appreciate that around
                    here.” Ultimately, that's where I went.</p>
                <p>I say ultimately, because I was originally slated to go to Vietnam. Coming back
                    to my incoming Foreign Service class of '69, fifty per cent going to Vietnam and
                    fifty per cent on other assignments: Well, those who thought they had escaped
                    the prospect of going to Vietnam, thought they were out of that, were informed
                    that our second assignment would be to the CORDS program in Vietnam. In fact, I
                    was assigned to one of the provinces in the south and was getting ready to move
                    back to Washington to take a year's language training when, I guess, as a result
                    of the peace talks, the CORDS program was cancelled. Or at least our assignments
                    were cancelled. I then went out to Colombo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Ceylon from '72 'til when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was there from January '72 to the spring of '75, for slightly over
                    three years as a political-labor officer, assigned to the political section of
                    the Embassy. My main responsibility was to cover domestic politics with
                    particular attention to the trade union movement. And the reason for the latter
                    was, given the complexion of the government at that time in Colombo, that the
                    trade unions played a particularly important role. So prior to going to Colombo
                    I took some training at the Labor Department, orientation really. Or should I
                    say indoctrination?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quickly, what did you get from the Labor Department,
                        because in those days, in foreign affairs, American labor was an important
                        policy. It had real clout in foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Absolutely, even though we had a Republican administration, it was
                    quite sensitive to labor and, of course, when I say labor I should be very
                    precise in saying the AFL/CIO. The AFL/CIO then totally controlled the labor
                    officer program in the State Department. They had a number of their former
                    officials who were now working for the Department. There was an advisor to the
                    Secretary for international labor affairs, who was always hand-picked by the
                    AFL/CIO. The training program for FSOs going overseas was very much oriented to
                    AFL/CIO interests. By that I mean exposure to the type of reporting they were
                    interested in, which fed into their own U.S. domestic agenda, for example,
                    foreign worker conditions as these impacted the general competitiveness of
                    American labor; labor rights, if you will, and the legal structure that affected
                    labor in our countries of assignment. The Federation maintained its own overseas
                    programs, funded by the USG with which we were expected to cooperate closely,
                    for Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Anti-communism was a powerful leitmotif of
                    the relationships they developed with other trade unions groups, mostly under
                    ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) auspices. As a labor
                    officer, and this was made very clear at the Department of Labor itself, you
                    were expected to be very attuned and very sensitive to AFL/CIO interests and to
                    their general clout in Washington. That was a very clear message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Mr. Asia in the Labor Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Overseas, our awareness was less on the Labor Department per se whose
                    focus was overwhelmingly domestic and much more on 16th street (the AFL/CIO
                    headquarters, just a block up from the White House.) and for those in Asia on
                    the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI.) It existed for many years and,
                    for all I know, it is still active. There certainly was a Mr. EuropIrving Brown.
                    He and others around him had been active right after World War II in Italy and
                    throughout the Continent, directly confronting the Communists. I haven't thought
                    of these names in many years. Irving Brown and the others were held up as
                    exemplars, if you will, as dynamic models of what U.S. labor policy, working
                    very closely with the State Department, could achieve in influencing individual
                    countries in ways that would be favorable to our interests. Asia was perhaps
                    less prominent but its profile was rising rapidly. The AAFLI came into being
                    only after the European institute, but was modeled on it. As I mentioned, there
                    was also an institute in Latin America and one, either at that time or later, in
                    Africa as well. Above all, they were concerned about the influence of Communists
                    in the local trade union movement and this gave particular focus to Sri Lanka or
                    Ceylon, as it was then known, because the labor movement there was divided into
                    various federations, some of which were strongly Communist controlled. Not only
                    that, but in fact the most prominent of them all was Trotskyite. Sri Lanka was
                    one of the few countries in the world where Trotskyites were influential, even
                    having powerful ministers in the coalition government that existed when I
                    arrived there. On the other hand, the Tamil tea workers were mostly in the
                    Ceylon Workers Congress, which was an ICFTU affiliate and worked closely with
                    the AAFLI.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, but his wife, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was the prime minister
                    when I arrived. She was certainly left of center in our terms and in her cabinet
                    was the head of the pro-Moscow Communist Party, a fellow by the name of Pieter
                    Keuneman, of Dutch background. There is a small but influential Dutch Eurasian
                    community in Sri Lanka. The Trotskyite minister was Colvin Da Silva along with a
                    third pro-China Communist minister in the government. All of them had their base
                    in trade union federations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: When I arrived, Ambassador Strausz-Hup� had already left. A fellow by
                    the name of Pete Peterson, who died some years ago, was then charg�. Ambassador
                    Christopher Van Hollen arrived in the late spring, I guess, of '72. His DCM was
                    Patricia Byrne. They were the team leading the embassy throughout the time that
                    I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are two people who were familiar with Asia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes. I believe Ambassador Van Hollen had been deputy assistant
                    secretary of state for South Asia in NEA at that time. Actually for Pat Byrne,
                    it was her first exposure to Asia, but as is often the case, the ambassador had
                    selected the DCM. I believe she had been in Turkey before going to Colombo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later went on to be ambassador in Burma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: To Burma, that's right and to Africa; she was ambassador in West
                    Africa, also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the embassy constituted? Did you have to break
                        ground on this labor thing, or had there already?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, I was taking over from my predecessor, Jim Leader, who then became
                    desk officer and remains a good friend of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jim has been very much a labor officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, over the years, that's right. For me, it was my first and only
                    assignment as a labor officer but Jim's advice, counsel, and contacts were very
                    helpful and greatly appreciated. So it was not a new position, nor a new area of
                    attention by Washington. But otherwise the embassy was typical, in terms of the
                    sections that were there and the agencies that were represented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what was the political situation, and economic
                        situation, in Ceylon when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I recall very well taking a trip up to Kandy, which is the second city,
                    in the interior, shortly after my arrival, encountering burned out bridges and
                    evidence of the brief but very violent uprising that had taken place just weeks
                    before my arrival, which as I mentioned was in January of '72. In what I believe
                    is November or December '71 an extreme Communist group, extreme Maoist group,
                    called the JVP, a very conspiratorial group, had organized and mounted an
                    overnight attempt to topple the government. This included attacks on Temple
                    Trees, the prime minister's official residence in Colombo, and coordinated
                    attacks on police posts and other security agencies around the island. It was
                    defeated, but only just so, with a considerable amount of luck on the part of
                    the government. So, understandably, the environment there was very tense and was
                    still resonating with what had just happened, both at the public level and
                    within the government. There was enormous concern about what this meant, who was
                    behind it. In Asia, my experience is that conspiracy theorizing is a dominant
                    part of people's political analysis. How should the government then move ahead?
                    This was very much in the forefront.</p>
                <p>Over time and as it became clear that this was a relatively small though highly
                    motivated group, they settled into this very typical Third World socialist
                    agenda, the centerpiece of which was the nationalization of the tea plantations.
                    Sri Lanka, or Ceylon then, is a major tea producer. Many of these plantations
                    and estates, as they're called there, had been British owned and there was a
                    very large British planter community still resident in Ceylon at that time. Very
                    systematically, through legislation that they adopted, they took over the
                    management and ownership of these plantations, but with very little real
                    compensation. It was all in long term government bonds very little cash involved
                    for the dispossessed owners. This was accompanied by other pieces of legislation
                    which met the needs of their trade union coalition allies.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>There was and still is, as I understand Sri Lanka politics to this day, enormous
                    tension between Mrs. Bandaranaike's party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
                    and the previous ruling party called the UNP, United National Party, then headed
                    by former Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and his deputy, J.R. Jayewardene.
                    These two, like the Bandaranaikes, were members of very prominent families, of
                    the same social background, educational and caste background. In many ways
                    politics then, maybe even today, were organized on divisions among families,
                    prominent families, with ideologies as a convenient tag. At that time, the Tamil
                    issue, which later became an all-consuming one in the Eighties, Nineties and
                    even today, was not as salient. The Tamils - and I had many contacts with the
                    Tamil leadership at that time, both in Colombo and then through regular travel
                    up to the northern part where they're concentrated in Jaffna - were still hoping
                    to find a place in this evolving system. But the ruling party reflected Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike's husband's philosophy, and he was the founder of the party, which
                    was one of appealing to the majority Sinhalese and to Buddhist sentiment, and of
                    feeding on the perceived grievance that the Tamils had been favored by the
                    British and, although a minority of only 15 per cent, they had enjoyed undue
                    benefit from this history, in terms of positions in government, in the private
                    sector, in education and so forth. So he went about cutting them down to size,
                    using the one man one - vote principle, sort of excluding them from any real
                    role in public life, and aiming at marginalizing them. A keynote of this was
                    making Sinhalese the official language, excluding Tamil and even English. This
                    became a real sore point for the Tamils, who of course also felt excluded
                    because the ruling party played up the role of Buddhism, made Buddhism the
                    official religion of the country, although there were very substantial Hindu,
                    Christian and Muslim minorities. So it was a polarized society, if you will,
                    split on ideological grounds, as I mentioned, in terms of the economic policies
                    they pursued, and on ethnic, linguistic, and religious factors. If you could
                    identify all of the factors that help divide a nation and a society, in Sri
                    Lanka they pursued them all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of a worse recipe as you said than what
                        their party was trying to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: So that was the environment. So far as the U.S. government was
                    concerned, Sri Lankan foreign policy was what you might have expected of that
                    kind of regime, which was very nationalistic, very Third World oriented. Mrs. B,
                    as everyone called her, viewed herself to be her husband's heir as a leader of
                    the non-aligned movement. After I had left she hosted one of the non-aligned
                    summit conferences in Colombo. So her public line and the policy line of her
                    government were very much couched in non-aligned terminology. It pitted her
                    against U.S. policy rhetorically, in UN votes, and in Asian regional terms.
                    Vietnam was winding down but only slowly, so that was a source of tension and
                    certainly of pot shots, particularly from the leftist members of her government.
                    And she particularly favored something called the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace,
                    which was directly aimed against the U. S. Navy presence in the Indian Ocean,
                    especially at Diego Garcia.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The only additional point I would make, in response to your question about the
                    economy, is that their economic policy was of the same type as their politics.
                    In other words, an emphasis on state management of the economy which of course
                    led to slow decline, stagnation of their exports, and a lot of other
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think, you know, just looking at tea plantations,
                        which require very close management. This isn't something you just sit there
                        and let it grow. And it's just the sort of thing that socialist management
                        would try to get in there, milk for what it could and not put the resources
                        and the management in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, that the management aspect; the labor tended to remain in place
                    and again that was sort of part of the nationalization deal with trade unions.
                    But you're quite right, the expatriate managers and Sri Lankan managers who were
                    running these places earlier were replaced by political appointees. And of
                    course, the other thing about tea plantations is that they require steady
                    reinvestment. Bushes, what they call the tea bush, particularly in Sri Lanka at
                    that time, had been planted in the 1880's and 1890's, and were old. They were
                    not as productive as those in East Africa or in some areas of South India. It
                    was time for significant replanting of new tea bushes and that was not done. So
                    the profits, such as they were, were not reinvested as they should have been. So
                    there was an immediate decline. This also, by the way, fit the rubber
                    plantations. Sri Lanka was an important producer of natural rubber and coconuts.
                    All three of those areas were primary commodities affected by similar
                    state-oriented policies. I understand that since then, speaking about many, many
                    years later, they've attempted to reintroduce private management and private
                    ownership, but I have no idea how that is faring now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the labor officer, you're looking at people, many of
                        whom have relied on these plantations or estates of one kind or another,
                        under steady management and if you socialize it, pretty soon when they start
                        going to pot, the money isn't there, the benefits aren't going to labor. Is
                        that apparent in your case?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: To be absolutely honest, one of the driving forces behind this
                    nationalization was that labor didn't get much to begin with. An important
                    source of grievance is that while the plantation labor force is Tamil, in Sri
                    Lanka - if we want to get into nitty- gritty detail - the Tamils are divided
                    into two communities. One are the northern Tamils, who have been there for many
                    centuries. The second are indentured laborers who were brought to Sri Lanka, as
                    to Mauritius and Trinidad and a number of other places, by the British in the
                    late nineteenth century. They're very distinct from the ones in the north. They
                    led self-contained lives on these estate enclaves, surrounded by Sinhalese
                    villagers. The villagers felt that they weren't getting anything out of this
                    system. They weren't getting any jobs for their young people or obtaining any
                    benefits. So there was a hope that under state management the fruits of this
                    would not go to foreign businesspeople, who would send out the money, but would
                    invest it locally. None of that happened. Even when I was there, those trends
                    began becoming apparent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did our embassy, through the ambassador and up and
                        down the embassy, including your contacts, how well were we connected to the
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: We had good relations. Ambassador Van Hollen, of whom I have the very
                    highest regard, had excellent relations with the GSL. For all of its
                    shortcomings, this was a democratic government. They were freely elected. They
                    conducted free elections, they always have. They were Western oriented, spoke
                    excellent English. I'm talking about leaders drawn from the upper crust of
                    traditional colonial society. They were very accessible. It's not that we were
                    not able to interact with them at all. We had excellent contacts. We were able
                    to see them when we wanted and there were points of agreement as well. For Sri
                    Lankans, regardless of background or politics, are always concerned about the
                    shadow of India. So they would want good relations with the United States, if
                    only to balance potential Indian influence. It's just that on basic issues we
                    often disagreed. As I say, they key one was this whole package of non-alignment
                    and in particular the Indian Ocean Peace Zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we were going through a difficult time, as I think
                        you expressed before, with India, anyway. They had the dissolution of East
                        Pakistan and all that. But this didn't particularly draw them closer to
                        us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: The Sri Lankans, you mean? No. I arrived not long after the Indian
                    intervention in East Pakistan but, to a surprising degree, there seemed little
                    concern about what this might mean for Sri Lanka. This fact is itself a good
                    indicator that the Tamil issue was nowhere near what it became just a few years
                    later. You'll recall that India did intervene in Sri Lanka in the late 1980's.
                    There was also the perceived similarity in views between Mrs. B and Indira
                    Gandhi, the Indian prime minister at the time. In general, it was felt that New
                    Delhi would act as a break on the Tamils, limiting the support they might
                    received from fellow Tamils in India. There was a history there. Prior to the
                    colonial period, the kingdoms in south India often intervened in Ceylon and
                    those memories are still quite vivid.</p>
                <p>This is a long way of saying that concerns about India at that time did not lead
                    the Sri Lankan leadership to draw closer to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were, what's the name of the province in India's
                        that's across</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Tamil Nadu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tamil Nadu. Was there much sort of leakage back and forth,
                        or what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, I would not say so. I would not say there was much. No. There were
                    pilgrimages of Sri Lankan or Ceylonese Hindus to shrines in south India but no,
                    there was no immigration, or emigration for that matter of the kind that existed
                    some decades before. Later on in the Eighties, when the Tamil insurgency
                    developed, there were strong ties between the Tamil nationalists in Ceylon and
                    Tamil counterparts but they excited as much suspicion in New Delhi as they did
                    in Colombo. It was a Tamil extremist, you'll recall, who assassinated Rajiv
                    Gandhi in 1991. I should mention, by the way, speaking of the Tamils, as I said
                    I had a lot of contact with them, but the people I dealt with were of an older
                    generation and not the ones who launched the insurgency which began in the early
                    Eighties. These were much younger men. The ones I knew were in their sixties,
                    seventies, sometimes in their eighties, so were trying to carve out a place for
                    themselves in the existing system. Whereas the younger ones and I had no contact
                    with them because we didn't even know they were out there, the militants who
                    later said, “The hell with it, we want independence.”</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: Trincomalee.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, the Sri Lankans were very jealous of their independence and very to
                    sensitive to Great Powers meddling in their own country, and I know there were
                    some so-called strategists in Washington who were fearful of that, but it was
                    never really an issue. The most specific issue we had, if you could call it
                    naval, was Diego Garcia. Our presence in Diego which began to be built up during
                    the Vietnam War and thereafter to counter the Soviets in the Horn of Africa, was
                    a major reason for the Sri Lankans and others pushing the Indian Ocean Peace
                    Zone. I don't recall any ship visits, any U.S. Navy ship visits, which isn't to
                    say there weren't any, my memory just doesn't call up any at the moment. We had
                    a navy attach� then; in fact the defense attach� was a naval officer, a U.S.
                    Navy commander. Operationally, there weren't any really issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find, what were you reporting. Were you more or
                        less limiting yourself to labor or were you reporting on what amounts to
                        internal politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, no, I was reporting on internal politics. I would have hated to
                    follow merely the minutiae of Ceylonese labor politics. As it was, no one in
                    Washington cared two hoots about what was going on in Sri Lanka or Ceylon,
                    anyway. Nobody read our reporting. I know that only too well, because my next
                    assignment was as desk officer for Sri Lanka, so I knew very well how little
                    anyone paid any attention. No one paid any attention, or very little attention,
                    to South Asia at that time and least of all to Sri Lanka. So just getting
                    Washington to read what we were reporting was a chore in itself. Just as an
                    anecdote illustrating this, I was particularly proud of what I recall was a 25
                    or 26 page air gram. You may recall that instead of telegrams in those days,
                    unless it was really urgent, we would send an air gram, which went by pouch. It
                    was a 26 page analysis of the so called land reform program, ( i.e.
                    nationalization.) I was very proud of that work which built on considerable
                    research, field travel, and interviews. So when I returned to Washington I
                    recall a conversation in the bureau. Someone, not knowing I was its author, held
                    up my airgram and said, “If you want an example of what's useless reporting,
                    here it is, right here.” And slapped it down on the table all 26 pages of it. I
                    learned a very important lesson from that experience. On the other hand, we
                    enjoyed considerable latitude at post since no one cared really much about what
                    was happening there. We had virtually no U.S. investment, no significant high
                    level visitors. We had one or two CODELs (Congressional delegations) who came to
                    shop for gems, Sri Lanka being a source of sapphires, shopping expeditions.
                    Therefore, we could do pretty well what we wanted. There was no post reporting
                    plan in those days, coordinated with Washington. So it allowed you to get into
                    the nitty-gritty of the country. Which I did. Today, as I know only too well
                    from my DCM experience, officers are pulled in so many directions that this is
                    rarely possible. And in places like the Arab world, we pay a heavy price.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, as for being in this hot spot for a couple,
                        three years, I guess. Were you married at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was married. I was married in '68. I came there with my first child,
                    a boy and then our second child, another boy, was born in Sri Lanka, in Colombo.
                    Personally, I should say, it was an extremely enjoyable experience. We had many,
                    many friends and very much enjoyed the Sri Lankan environment and the embassy
                    environment as well. So I look back at that as one of the high points of my
                    career, from a personal point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you came back in '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That's right, I came back in '75 and spent a few weeks on the Iran
                    desk. The only thing I remember about that is Charlie Naas, who was the office
                    director, called me in, welcomed me, and pointed to my desk. I was only there
                    while they were scurrying around to place me elsewhere in NEA. And he
                    immediately said, “Well, you'll be working on ...,” I forget what it was. I
                    said, “I know nothing about Iran.” He paused and looked me in the eye, saying,
                    “You're an FSO, aren't you?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “End of discussion.” He was
                    right. That brief exchange told me instantly what being a U.S. Foreign Service
                    officer is all about, including esprit de corps. I have never forgotten it.</p>
                <p>After that then I went, as I mentioned before, to be desk officer for Sri Lanka
                    in what was then and now is still known as INS, the Office of India, Nepal, Sri
                    Lanka Affairs in the then NEA. Today it's in SA, the Bureau of South Asian
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you it for</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: For Sri Lanka and the Maldives. I should have mentioned the Maldives. I
                    never made it to the Maldives when I was stationed there but the ambassador in
                    Colombo was also accredited to the Maldives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were doing this for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In INS? I was there for three years, 'til '78. I was two years desk
                    officer for Sri Lanka, one year as political officer for India and then I went
                    into Hindi language training for a year at FSI prior to being assigned to New
                    Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '75 to '78 period. In the first place, had
                        this become Sri Lanka?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Just trying to think. I believe it did, I believe it did. That's the
                    traditional name of the country. Ceylon was the foreign name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything that happened? Were you getting 26 page
                        reports there that got you all excited?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The major issue there was grappling with the Zone of Peace concept that
                    aimed at regulating, i.e. constraining, non-littoral naval presence and
                    activities in the Indian Ocean, including the right of free passage.
                    Understandably, this notion was anathema to our Navy. It became a real irritant,
                    because it was not only a Sri Lankan notion. It had been, if I recall correctly,
                    initiated by Mrs. Bandaranaike but it was very much picked up by India and by
                    all the countries of the littoral who made it a centerpiece of their regional
                    policy, recalling how the USS Enterprise had sailed into the Bay of Bengal to
                    apply pressure on India during its 1970 war with Pakistan. It was a constant
                    point of friction between ourselves and the Sri Lankans. Those were the days
                    when the Soviets had a base, we thought a naval base, in Somalia at a place
                    called Berbera and there was a lot of dire thinking about the Soviets, how they
                    were expanding their presence in the Indian Ocean. That was sort of the grand
                    issue, the one issue in which Sri Lanka could claim higher level attention. I
                    recall it involving a lot of interaction with the PM Bureau, the IO Bureau
                    (because much of this was played out in the UN environment,) and with the
                    Pentagon. Otherwise, there was the routine work of the desk officer. A lot of
                    managing of visitors, for example, the PL-480 program, the sort of briefing
                    memos on military assistance or at least military relationships, briefing a new
                    Ambassador for his nomination hearings, you just name it. But I don't recall any
                    sort of glowing moment at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would image this Sea of Peace Zone of Peace Zone of
                        Peace wouldn't even get the time of day from, particularly the American
                        Navy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, the Pentagon was very concerned about this. If it was ever adopted
                    and implemented then it would have severely limited our ability to deploy in the
                    Indian Ocean. And of course, as I mentioned, it reflected a hostility to U.S.
                    Navy operations in the Indian Ocean and had some impact on our ability to access
                    ports, to have joint exercises with local navies, and to develop navy to navy
                    relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did we, the Navy of course, and rightly so,
                        immediately goes into extreme defensive mode when it comes to anything that
                        would limit its ability.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Exactly, and so there was a lot of pressure on the Department to
                    counter this. A lot of the action took place at the United Nations and in
                    various UN fora so that the concept wouldn't gain traction. Coordinating with
                    our allies as well and keeping an eye on what the Russians were up to, the
                    Soviets were up to, in the Indian Ocean. So I certainly don't recall ever
                    twiddling my thumbs or having nothing to do, as we were always very busy. But,
                    as I say, I can't recall the specific details of individual issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get very much involved in Indian affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was backup officer for the India desk but was not directly involved
                    until I became desk officer, political officer for India, it was called. I took
                    that job in '77. I had come back to Washington in January '75. So '75 'til '77
                    and '77 to '78 I was desk officer, and then I went into Hindi language training
                    prior to assignment to Delhi. The India desk was a higher profile job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How were relations in '77 and '78? How were relations
                        with India? This is Carter's Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: This was the Carter Administration. For years there was a great deal of
                    anti-India sentiment on the Hill, and for a variety of reasons. One was the
                    bitterness over the East Pakistan issue and the Treaty of Friendship that the
                    Indians had signed with the Soviet Union in 1971. In 1974 you had the Indian
                    nuclear explosion, which had an enormous impact politically here in Washington.
                    In 1975 Mrs. Gandhi declared an emergency and suspended parliament and
                    democratic governance. Any one of these was deeply damaging to the relationship
                    but as one piled on to the other, it accentuated a climate of antipathy toward
                    India, reviving old memories of Krishna Menon, who had been foreign minister
                    under Nehru, and not made any easier by Mrs. Gandhi's acerbic style and
                    rhetoric. There was just a view of India as a major pain in the butt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Krishna Menon hung on for years. He may have been gone,
                        but the thought of him in the United Nations, looking like, well he looked
                        like Khomeini, piercing eyes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Sort of jutting jaw, and so forth, yeah. So India was not held in high
                    regard. Now mitigating this was the Carter Administration, Miss Lillian had been
                    a Peace Corps volunteer in India, Carter's mother. As candidate, President
                    Carter had spoken favorably of improving relations with India. Moreover, in
                    1977, once she lifted the emergency, Mrs. Gandhi then held elections and was not
                    just soundly defeated, she was wiped out altogether. And a coalition government,
                    headed by a odd fellow named Morarji Desai, became prime minister, leading a
                    group of parties, almost all of whose leaders had been in jail under Mrs. Gandhi
                    and who of course were committed to restoring democratic government. So this was
                    a natural plank on which to build a new relationship.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, the biggest and most contentious issue remained. What I have
                    mentioned so far has just been sort of backdrop but at that time, what the
                    change in administration here and change of government there did not really
                    affect, was disagreement over nuclear policy. As a result of the Indian nuclear
                    explosion, so-called peaceful nuclear explosion, in 1974 the Administration
                    invoked the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty which India never signed, to suspend
                    nuclear cooperation with India. In the early 1960's, as a result of Eisenhower's
                    Atoms for Peace program, we had built a nuclear reactor at Tarapur, which is a
                    suburb of Bombay, that generated a substantial percentage of the power
                    requirements for Bombay city. I think they had 250 or 260 megawatts and it was
                    supplied with U.S. nuclear fuel, and had been for many years, a supply which was
                    now terminated. At the same time, Carter announced that he would defer, that the
                    U.S. would defer commercial reprocessing and the recycling of plutonium. In
                    other words, the initial agreement had been that we would supply the nuclear
                    fuel and then take back the spent fuel for reprocessing in the United States. So
                    not only were the Indians, from their point of view, subject to a unilateral
                    abrogation of an agreement but they were then stuck with the problem that they
                    might not have nuclear fuel and would not be able to reprocess their spent fuel.
                    So they could find themselves in a real bind. Managing this issue was the
                    central focus for us during the time that I was desk officer and for several
                    years thereafter. It was only in, during the Reagan Administration that we
                    arrived at a deal in which the French, we and the Indians agreed that the French
                    would take over the supplying of fuel.</p>
                <p>For example, we spent enormous amounts of time on trying to find ways to
                    reconfigure the pool at Tarapur in which the nuclear fuel rods are kept. I know
                    nothing about nuclear reactors but my understanding is that, say you bring in a
                    bundle of these rods, which look like steel rods. And they're used up over time.
                    They're stored in a storage tank similar to a swimming pool full of water. There
                    was only so much built-in capacity but if you're ingenious about it, you can
                    find ways of storing more rods than the pool originally was intended to hold.
                    Thus the diplomats tried to figure a way out of the bind so that Bombay city
                    wouldn't be cut off from its electricity supply. We commissioned consultants to
                    study this. The interagency process, as you can imagine, for these kinds of
                    issues is extremely complex. So this was a big focus for me personally and for
                    our office.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Indian embassy? Some embassies are
                        more effective than others and how did you find the Indian embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The Indian embassy at that time, in my view, was not very effective.
                    True, they were dealt a poor hand of cards to play, given the attitudes that
                    existed. As I say, the Achilles heel of the U.S.-Indian relationship at that
                    time was the Hill. The president, left to himself, I think, would have moved
                    ahead and been much more positive. But the Hill was the problem. In addition to
                    the legislation I mentioned, there was something called also the Symington
                    Amendment, which really constrained the administration's freedom of action. But
                    instead of devoting the bulk of the energy of the ambassador and his key
                    officers to explaining themselves and cultivating relationships on the Hill,
                    they figured all they had to deal with was the State Department and to a lesser
                    extent the White House. But they had little or no access to the White House, so
                    it was the State Department. It was not a very productive approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand, too, that as opposed, say, to the
                        Pakistanis, that Indians tended to stick on their dignity. So the ambassador
                        had to meet somebody</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That is a stereotype of Indian diplomats that existed for many years.
                    Fortunately, and I can attest personally to this, it is no longer accurate. But
                    at that time, certainly, there was a lot of truth to it. They could be very
                    prickly to deal with. They had a big chip on their shoulder. I think it
                    reflected what anyone who lived in India was well aware of, a profound
                    inferiority complex. It took them a long time to get over that. The Pakistanis,
                    on the other hand, tended to be more the hail fellow well met sort. And of key
                    importance, they had a natural constituency in the U.S. government, and thus on
                    the Hill, which the Indians did not have, which was the Pentagon. They had
                    military regimes, so some of their key people tended to be military officers.
                    There was a bond there which the Indians never were able to match. They tended
                    to be much more effective in their relations on the Hill, and substantively,
                    policy wise, there were not as many problems with Pakistan, unlike today. But,
                    yes, that limited the Indians, but I'm not sure that even if they had been the
                    finest diplomats they would have been able to overcome the cards they were
                    dealt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it doesn't help. This is one of the things it doesn't
                        help. Diplomacy can help or impede depending on well you use your instrument
                        and some countries don't use their very well. And America of course is an
                        extremely complicated environment in which to work. . The idea that if you
                        want something done you go to the State Department is almost ludicrous. It's
                        the Hill, it's getting lobbyists, it's getting the media, it's getting the
                        NSC, obviously the Pentagon. It's a complicated board. If you play it by the
                        book, you're dead. How were we, during this time you were doing this with
                        the Desai government, he died not too long ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He died not too long ago but he certainly was very much alive then.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how did we evaluate the Desai government and its
                        effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Again, I think the highest personal regard was extended to Prime
                    Minister Desai. He was a man of unbending rectitude and was recognized for that.
                    He had suffered considerably for his political stance in confronting Mrs.
                    Gandhi. But his virtue was also his vice, if you will. When he became prime
                    minister with a coalition of a number of parties, it was very hard for them to
                    pull together and he was not the kind of man to scratch one's back, I can't
                    think of the expression here. But he just was not able to work cooperatively
                    with his senior ministers, many of whom thought they should be prime minister as
                    well. So the result was that he was regarded as presiding over a government that
                    frittered away its chance, because we could see, very steadily, Mrs. Gandhi's
                    political resurrection in India, in spite of the experience with the emergency,
                    gather steam. So she was a very acerbic critic of the Desai government's
                    policies and to some extent of the United States as well. So we wished them
                    well. The President himself visited India, in '78 and Desai also made a very
                    successful visit to Washington. As the desk officer I remember that one very
                    well. But it didn't really translate and there was certainly no breakthrough on
                    this nuclear issue that I talked about.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, it never really did. It remained a sort of a talking point for a
                    number of years but it ran out of steam and was overtaken by other issues,
                    particularly after the Afghan War began.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How'd you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: You know, I had been a student in India before, in the Sixties, but I
                    had not studied Hindi. I had no particular problem with languages, having been
                    bilingual in French and English since childhood. So there was no, if you will,
                    psychological barrier. I should say, as an aside, when I took Arabic many people
                    asked, “At your age, you're taking Arabic? What is this? It's ridiculous.” My
                    one gripe, I still feel strongly about this, about the Hindi course that I took
                    was the emphasis on formal, very elevated, what we call Sanskritized Hindi,
                    which is not the language that is spoken. So Hindi is like Greek, another
                    language that comes to mind, and there are others as well, Turkish being one.
                    Twentieth century nationalism resulted in efforts to purge Hindi and those
                    languages of extraneous influences to the source. The problem is that spoken
                    Hindi doesn't necessarily reflect the high falutin' version that is taught at
                    FSI. Ironically, Hindi and Urdu which at the spoken level are identical,
                    separated by their script, have each been cleansed of each other's influence.
                    Formal Urdu is loaded with Persian and Arabic with most Sanskrit words having
                    been eliminated. A mirror image of what happened with Hindi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had problem that when I was in Greece. They were
                        teaching katharevousa, which is the cleaned up language. People actually
                        spoke demotic, the people's language. We sounded silly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They're quite distinct. And exactly the same in Hindi, where they tried
                    to purge it of Arabic or Persian words that had accumulated, after centuries of
                    contacts with the Muslims, and they went to Sanskrit for the root source to
                    construct a new version of the language, supposedly in part to incorporate
                    modern concepts and terminology. So that was the language that was taught, what
                    I call “radio Hindi.” And I also spent a lot of time, particularly on the
                    reading part of the language program, a lot of effort, but when I got there I
                    found that nobody used it, nobody spoke that way. So that was one complaint that
                    I had. In effect, I had to relearn Hindi, as more of a spoken, colloquial
                    language. My second gripe about it is that - and this is true to this day, I
                    believe - they give equal weight to reading as well as to speaking. Particularly
                    in a one year language program, the reading is at the expense of the spoken. And
                    when you have this gap that I mentioned between the high falutin' and the
                    people's way of speaking, it just means a waste of time. And particularly in
                    India, where the press you're interested in is overwhelmingly in English anyway
                    and the local language papers all are all subsidiaries of the English language
                    ones and where they usually translate from English into the vernacular in many
                    cases. So when you're there and you're busy, you don't have time to spend a lot
                    of time reading the newspapers, especially when you have so many papers in
                    English. So they'd be much wiser to recognize that reality, teach you Hindi
                    reading, which is very easy. It's a very phonetic language. It has forty
                    characters. You can learn to read in a couple of hours, not necessarily
                    understanding anything but you can mouth the words, if you will. You're much
                    better off spending that time on speaking Hindi. Now maybe in other languages,
                    French, Spanish, German, Russian, maybe you need that balance. It was the same
                    when I was in Arabic. Much too much emphasis on the reading and not enough on
                    the speaking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out, then, to India. I take it you went to India
                        in '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In summer of '79, yes. I was there for four years, from summer of '79
                    to summer of '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were relations like with India when you arrived in
                        '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was political officer again in the section, again covering domestic,
                    domestic politics, in a much larger section than I had had in Colombo. As I
                    arrived, we were in the final months of the Desai government. He had been
                    displaced and one of his colleagues in the cabinet, a man by the name of Charan
                    Singh, became prime minister, with elections scheduled to be held in January. He
                    was presiding over an interim government, a caretaker government. So this was a
                    time of politicking. So Mrs. Gandhi was then campaigning and we got early
                    exposure to her line of thinking because she was critical of the government for
                    cozying up to the Americans. Then of course, in November, I believe, the Soviets
                    moved into Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, I think it was Christmas, around Christmas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Christmas, yes, could be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, November was the hostage crisis in Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Shortly before that, Ambassador Spike Dubs was killed in Kabul. By the
                    way, he had been deputy assistant secretary for South Asia in NEA. So he was
                    very well known in our office and a great guy. The impact of his murder was just
                    devastating in Kabul. That was before the Soviets moved in. Yeah, Christmas, I
                    guess it was. Christmas of '79, when the Soviets occupied Kabul and Spike was
                    killed just a few months before that, a short time before that. Then the Indian
                    election itself was held within two or three weeks of the Soviet occupation and
                    Mrs. Gandhi won overwhelmingly. A real seesaw: She had been so dominant during
                    the Emergency, was just swept out of office, left with only a handful of seats
                    in Parliament and then came back with an overwhelming majority. So it's a
                    reflection of how dissatisfied the public was with the Desai government. And
                    then she made comments about the Soviet occupation which just aroused tremendous
                    anger in the United States. A very understanding and soft response to the
                    occupation of a neighboring country, after all, just nearby, by a superpower.
                    And that, as I say, fed into the very negative climate that had been
                    longstanding so far as public opinion and Congressional opinion towards India
                    were concerned. A lot of it was focused on Mrs. Gandhi, the new prime minister.
                    She tried then to backpedal in later statements. The one I'm mentioning was at
                    the United Nations, by a UN representative. But it was very difficult. It set
                    the tone. I mean her attitude was confrontational and during the campaign she
                    wrapped herself in this mantle of nationalism, Indian nationalism, and was
                    highly critical of India's neighbors for “making eyes”, which is an expression
                    in Hindi, towards the United States. She singled out a small country like
                    Bhutan. I can't imagine a smaller country than Bhutan and yet it was depicted as
                    a threat to Indian security. Yet, India, by treaty, controlled Bhutanese foreign
                    policy, literally. That's the kind of rhetoric she was willing to engage in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Iranian takeover of our embassy and the
                        Iranian revolution play in India? You were in place by that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That may have taken place a little earlier. That was in '78, wasn't it,
                    '78 or '79?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The revolution was '78ish. The takeover of the embassy was
                        in November '79. Shortly thereafter was the burning of our embassy in
                        Islamabad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: That was in 1980. That was after the attack on the Great Mosque in
                    Mecca. There was no sympathy towards the Khomeini government in India. There was
                    a concern as to what it meant for Islamic opinion in India. After all, India has
                    the second largest population of Muslims after Indonesia. So there's always a
                    concern about what Indian Muslim opinion might be. Now the Iranians are Shias;
                    most Indian Muslims are Sunnis. So there was certainly no endorsement or hailing
                    of the Embassy seizure. It was a clear violation of diplomatic status of the
                    embassy, holding of hostages. That said, they were not inclined to be critical
                    of the Iranians in any public comments. They deplored, they'd regret, they'd
                    call for a resolution of the issue, but no strong condemnation. Again, I think,
                    reflecting uncertainty over Indian Muslim opinion as well. But as I said this
                    was quickly overshadowed by the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indira Gandhi made mollifying remarks about Soviet actions
                        and all that. But what about in actuality? During the time you were there,
                        how were the Indians, as we could sound it, feeling about the Soviets moving
                        into that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, the media generally took their lead from the government. One of
                    the striking contrasts between my time in India in the early Eighties and my
                    time in India in the early two thousands was how much the media had changed. But
                    at that time the Indian media followed their government's line quite closely.
                    The commentators, who are quite influential in India, all tended to echo the
                    government, to some extent. There were some exceptions, but generally
                    speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there any particular reason for this? Are they
                        paid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I think there was a feeling that the Soviets were longstanding friends.
                    The Treaty of Friendship had been very helpful to India after the war with
                    Pakistan in the early Seventies. The Soviets had been willing to provide arms to
                    India when we were providing arms to Pakistan. There was a feeling that the
                    Soviets were a dependable friend of India and this attitude led to a
                    soft-pedaling of their comments on the Soviet action. That said, there was
                    absolutely no enthusiasm for the occupation of Afghanistan and very considerable
                    concern with what it could mean over the longer term for India itself and for
                    its impact on Pakistan, and therefore also its impact on the Pakistan-U.S.
                    relationship. So as they worked this out, there was very real discomfort with
                    the Soviet occupation, particularly since it gave us a handle or leverage and a
                    rationale for turning our relations with Pakistan around and for beginning to
                    develop a military supply relationship. And that sort of, in their view, brought
                    the Cold War closer to their borders than had been the case before. But as I
                    say, their public line was relatively muted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Indian government? You
                        know, at your level. And with the media and movers and shakers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I didn't deal much, being focused on domestic politics, with the
                    foreign ministry or the government ministries. I spent a lot of time with Indian
                    politicians, journalists. Our consular district for Delhi was, and still is,
                    northern India. So I often traveled with the ambassador and others and by myself
                    to neighboring states. And at the personal level, there was very rarely any of
                    this tension that existed between the two governments, from my earliest exposure
                    to India to the present. There's no connection between them. People would relate
                    to you on a personal basis. Having access to them was not a problem. They'd
                    often be flattered that an American diplomat was seeking them out and seeking
                    their views. So that was never an issue, that was never an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The first ambassador when I was there was Ambassador Robert Goheen,
                    former president of Princeton, who was born in India of missionary parents. In
                    fact he was very proud that when his children were there they were the fifth
                    generation of the family to have an experience in India. His family had first
                    come in the 1860's or '70's. But he was appointed by President Carter. The
                    second ambassador was Ambassador Harry Barnes, a career ambassador, the first
                    career ambassador, in fact one of the few career ambassadors we've had to India
                    since relations were established there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see him? How did he help us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Which one? Goheen or Barnes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barnes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Barnes was very, was extremely active. And being well aware of the sort
                    of the big issues that stymied relations between Washington and Delhi, he set
                    out to identify areas of cooperation which previous ambassadors had not
                    emphasized. So in scientific collaboration, in education, in culture and
                    generally in non-political areas, he sought to begin a process of interaction
                    across a whole range of significant members of the elite, to the extent that
                    that was possible. He was very successful in getting funding for this approach
                    and in launching these through bilateral agreements at the technical level and
                    India was a very fertile field for that. So that was his emphasis. I should add
                    he's an excellent, in fact an outstanding, linguist. So he made it a point of
                    learning Hindi. He was very visible, traveled extensively. He was an outstanding
                    ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing, or was it indeed a fact, there were a
                        good number of the young people in India, the educated group, were going to

                        that? Or was that happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That was happening, significantly. There was a tremendous demand for
                    education in the United States. I remember well, to harken back to my previous
                    stint as desk officer, when Prime Minister Morarji Desai came to Washington, of
                    course we prepared all the briefing papers, these were for meetings at the White
                    House. Then the first, or I don't know about the first, but one of the issues
                    that he raised was student visas. I wasn't present but my office director told
                    me that President Carter and the U.S. officials at the table were taken aback -
                    there was noting in the briefing papers about that. And it was sort of a mark of
                    Desai's quirkiness; he hadn't told anyone in his own entourage he would raise
                    it. They were all staring at him. What the hell is this about student visas? And
                    then he launched into a long explanation of how a consular officer in Madras,
                    today Chennai, was systematically denying visas to worthy Indians. The
                    President, believe me, worked fast to inquire what was going on. What happened
                    was, the consular officer, someone in his late fifties for whom it was his
                    second tour and his last assignment was claiming that all the Indians were
                    intending immigrants, had no intention of returning, and denying visas
                    wholesale. I was later on the Board of Examiners and, as I recall, I don't think
                    there's an age cutoff for new officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, there isn't but you have to be able to complete two
                        tours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, but I mean he was in sort of the, he was retiring after his
                    second tour. He just didn't like being in India. The result of this
                    arbitrariness coming to the President's personal attention was actually
                    extremely beneficial for the longer term because it was made very clear to him,
                    and more generally, that it was not appropriate for him and others to assert, in
                    effect, that “You're studying computer science, or you're studying dentistry or
                    electrical engineering, and you know that these jobs, most of these degrees
                    don't exist in India or don't pay well, so therefore your true intention must be
                    to remain in the United States.” Today our presumption is different, and it was
                    clarified as a result of this incident, namely that it is not a legitimate
                    question to ask or assumption to make in judging the visa applicant. But it
                    reflected, as I say, this tremendous pressure to study in the United States.
                    Most of these young people, young men but there were many women as well, came
                    from well established families from all over India. So they were an important,
                    if you will, part of a pro-American constituency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, let's do something off of this. Students get a
                        look at us and we're a very attractive country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: And the fact is, of course, many, many, many of them remained in the
                    United States and the Indian-American community now is quite large, and we have
                    reaped the benefit of this twenty years later, if I can fast-forward. Because
                    they're now quite influential in our own society, in our own economy, and they
                    are a real bulwark of the U.S.-India relationship but this was not so obvious
                    then. More broadly, consular officers are typically the first point of contact
                    between the United States and local people. That, too, is not always recognized.
                    So the guidelines reminding officers of what are the appropriate assumptions to
                    make which they receive from the Consular section chief and from the mission
                    leadership as a whole are really critical because that impact, that initial
                    interaction, has ripple effects many, many times over than just the one-on-one
                    discussion with an individual visa applicant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, unfortunately, we're going through a very bad patch,
                        now, the security thing and we're shooting ourselves in the foot in the Arab
                        world with this. Well, did you find as went around the political parties,
                        what were they, were there real issues or were this jockeying for positions
                        of influence or jobs or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Among the political parties? Well, the Indian parties for the most part
                    are well established and have been there a long time and they tend to be
                    identified with either particular areas of the country or particular interest
                    groups. At that time the Congress Party, led by the Prime Minister, Indira
                    Gandhi, was the dominant influence, inherited from the time of the independence
                    movement. Most of the parties there were sort of split- offs from Congress, had
                    split off over time, their leaders had set up their own groups, or they were
                    regional parties, which are important in India. So, yeah, they had genuine and
                    well established differences, based on those interests. But what was more
                    important was their commitment to the democratic process and system. For India,
                    that is really crucial, given the diversity of the country, that this is how you
                    reconcile policy questions and issues, through a process of democratic mediation
                    in which the opposition has a legitimate and respected role, that they are very
                    free to criticize, to offer their own ideas and that they have access to the
                    media and to the public channels of communication. That was all there.</p>
                <p>The one group that was particularly influential and just strenuously
                    anti-American was the Communist Party of India. Again, there are several
                    communist parties and one is called the CPI-ML, Marxist Leninist, who were
                    prominent in Bengal, much easier to deal with. But this Communist Party of India
                    was the pro-Soviet party and their relationship with the Soviets through the
                    Soviet embassy and the Soviet cultural center and so-called Friendship
                    Societies, was very powerful. And they had newspapers, one particularly, called
                    the Patriot, which were subsidized by the Soviets and we could see that. The
                    minute the Soviet Union collapsed and this support ended, the paper folded.
                    Suddenly the CPI, which still exists became a relatively tiny, tinny voice
                    compared to what it had been before.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I particularly single them out and remember them because they mounted a specific
                    campaign to deny the assignment of our new political counselor, who would have
                    been my boss as section head, a fellow by the name of George Griffin. George had
                    served in Calcutta in 1970-71, at the time of the East Pakistan War. The claim,
                    again, had been made by communists, not by anyone else, that he was in touch
                    with Pakistanis trying to undermine the Indian policy in what was then East
                    Pakistan, what is today Bangladesh. At the time, in 1980, he was in Kabul,
                    Afghanistan. We had not yet broken relations with the Kabul government. But his
                    family was living in Delhi and he was stationed in Kabul as a political officer
                    and periodically he would visit his family in Delhi as there were direct flights
                    between Delhi and Kabul. So based on his experience, his knowledge of the
                    region, the fact that he's a very fine officer, the Bureau decided he should be
                    assigned as political counselor in Delhi, which made a lot of sense. When that
                    became known, a tremendous press campaign against George Griffin was mounted, in
                    which he was depicted as a CIA agent out to subvert the Indians. Here, it was
                    claimed, he had been subverting them, subverting India in Calcutta, here he was
                    conspiring with reactionary forces in Kabul and now he was going to play the
                    same game in Delhi itself. It finally became such a drumbeat that the government
                    specifically asked that he not be assigned, refused to accredit him as political
                    counselor, before he arrived. We retaliated, we responded by denying then their
                    assignment of a political counselor but it left a very bad taste in peoples'
                    mouths. But the communists were a very loud, very vocal, and very anti-American
                    element in the political spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have, see a problem from time to time that the
                        Indians and the Americans tend to preach at each other. They're both, in
                        some ways they preach past each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, that's been a consistent feature of our relationship. Again,
                    excepting the last few years and when we get to that point in our dialogue,
                    we'll have to discuss it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've really changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They've really changed but for a long time, for a long time, that was
                    absolutely the case, absolutely the case, yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you notice this? Was there a way of getting
                        around this or did you have to sort of listen to the sermon before you could
                        get to the point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I heard plenty of this in Delhi and traveling around northern
                    India but you would never let these things go unanswered. Not that you would
                    respond with a sermon of your own, but to whatever the kernel of their complaint
                    was, you - at least my approach was - sought to address that, so that they would
                    understand that there's a rebuttal, if you will. It varied a lot depending on
                    the individual and maybe even categories of individuals. If you were with the
                    politicians, you found much less of it. They were pragmatists who had survived a
                    lot to be where they were. The journalists, on the other hand, tended to be the
                    lecturing type and of course there were the academics, but also many plain
                    citizens would sound off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the academic connection. In so many places,
                        academia, including the United States, seems to be the last refuge of the
                        theoretical Marxists, of the sort of anti-American line of thought. Was that
                        evident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: There was plenty of that. Particularly since there were a lot of
                    newspapers in Delhi and in other major cities, all in English. They had to fill
                    those pages and there's always an editorial page. So academics were often called
                    on to contribute their thinking to that. And so when the issues were on
                    international affairs there was very often an anti-American tinge to that or, as
                    they would phrase it, a “non-aligned' perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation as regards the Sikhs? Was that the
                        Punjab? Because this later cost the prime minister her life. But how did the
                        situation, while you were there, how did we see this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Punjab was part of my beat, if you will, and I often went there, up to
                    Amritsar and Jullundur, occasionally to Chandigarh, the state capital, but
                    that's just an artificial town, or it was at that time. I heard a lot of
                    grievance against Mrs. Gandhi, sort of against the system. A feeling that Sikhs
                    were discriminated against. A lot of it were echoes of what I had heard in Sri
                    Lanka from Tamils. But this was several years before so many Sikhs moved into an
                    extremist and very violent phase. It's just a reminder that you have to be very
                    careful in dealing with minorities, in any society. In many ways, it was hard to
                    understand their grievance. Sikhs are among the most prosperous Indians and
                    Punjab is among the most prosperous states in India. Also the Sikhs, unlike the
                    Tamils in Sri Lanka, have long exercised a role and had a visibility on the
                    national scene out of proportion to their numbers. The national government had
                    always gone out of its way to accommodate the Sikhs, such as by creating a Sikh
                    majority state, and this with very little public or Hindu opposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>A lot of it was wrapped up in internal Sikh politics and again, just as in Sri
                    Lanka, where the Buddhist monks were the seedbed of a lot of this very
                    aggressive form of Sinhalese nationalism, and likewise the mullahs in Islamic
                    countries, in the Sikh environment, the Sikh religious men and holy men -
                    technically there's no priesthood for Sikhs - were very active. And then of
                    course you had political factions. You had Sikhs aligned with the Congress Party
                    and you had other Sikhs who were against it. And you know in poor countries
                    where politics is a zero-sum game in many cases, any advantage to you is at the
                    expense of someone else. And so unless you're careful in how you manage this and
                    unless you're inclusive as well, you can generate a lot of resentment and a
                    sense of grievance. And I think this is what happened in Punjab.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time and again we're talking up to '83, did the
                        expatriate Sikh communities in Canada or the United States play any
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, that would be, that was after, particularly after the Indian siege
                    on the Golden Temple, which I believe was in '83. So that event really generated
                    enormous resentment overseas. And again, the Tamil parallel is striking, because
                    your most militant Tamils, so far as Sri Lanka is concerned, typically are the
                    ones who tend to be overseas and provide the funding and the support, like the
                    Irish in America for the IRA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And other groups. And, of course, the Sikhs and the Tamils
                        killed two Gandhis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Two Gandhis, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when Ronald Reagan came in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He was in '81, yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall, how was he portrayed? This is kind of a
                        shocker to people, a movie actor and all this, all of a sudden president of
                        the United States, coming out of the right wing. Now it's not as extreme
                        right wing as we see today, but in those days it was the extreme right wing
                        of the Republican Party. Is this in a way a problem to explain it or is this
                        a matter of concern, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I think there was a shock, after Carter, who, as I say, personally had
                    made gestures reaching out to India that Reagan would succeed him. That said,
                    Mrs. Gandhi was very much a pragmatist and she did not make any special effort
                    to criticize, if you will, our new choice of a president. There was concern that
                    the Republican administration would provide more arms to Pakistan. That's really
                    the touchstone of the U.S.-India relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well it seems the Democrats give money or are more
                        friendly to India, Republicans more to Pakistan. It's not really true,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, it's not true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's one of those political urban legends.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That's right. In fact historically, and I think many Indians will tell
                    you this, now, that relations with the United States have been best under
                    Republican administrations. And, surprisingly enough, that was the case with
                    Reagan, as well because he acted to put Tarapur behind us. Remember I mentioned
                    that this had been the sore point when Carter and Desai met. They had been
                    unable to resolve it, in spite of all the flowery expressions of good will and
                    personal admiration and so forth and so the issue just floundered there,
                    poisoning the relationship. To Reagan's credit, he said, “We gotta do something
                    about it” and in a very short period of time we came up with a policy whereby we
                    stepped out of the picture, the French stepped in, and we didn't continue
                    insisting on safeguards for their reactors even though we had stopped supplying
                    fuel, which had been the line beforehand. I mean the nonproliferation
                    theologians populated the Democratic administration and were much more muted
                    during the Republican administration. That made a significant impact and there
                    was also a very good meeting between Reagan and Mrs. Gandhi at Cancun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to, I think it was Steve Eisenbraun and Steve was
                        in Washington, describing the work that went into a Gandhi-Reagan meeting.
                        The idea being that Ronald Reagan could charm, I won't say the pants off
                        anyone, it's not true but anyway he's a real charmer and it was genuine. The
                        thought, you know, let's sort of let these two get together and it worked at
                        the time.</hi>

                <p>THIBAULT: It worked and Mrs. Gandhi herself, who made a very successful visit to
                    Washington, could be equally charming. And again, coming back to Harry Barnes,
                    who was Reagan's ambassador in New Delhi, as I said, Harry's concept was to
                    identify specific areas for cooperation. He was doing this, to a major extent he
                    was giving the lead to this but the administration was prepared to follow him,
                    or at least it was a give and take with the administration, saying why don't we
                    try this. Now this had never happened with Carter. And then the shock of the
                    Afghanistan issue had died down, we had overcome it. And then, of course, Mrs.
                    Gandhi died in '84, when Reagan was still president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we started getting very close to Pakistan and arming
                        the mujahideen in Afghanistan while you were on this tour in India?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: We had. After the invasion of Afghanistan the administration had sent
                    out two envoys. One was Clark Clifford to New Delhi and the other was Zbigniew
                    Brzezinski to Pakistan. The Pakistanis were as much under the nuclear gun as the
                    Indians were and we had terminated our military and arms supply relationship
                    with them under the Symington Amendment, as we had for India. Not that we had
                    had any with India and therefore the impact was all the greater for Pakistan.
                    But we reversed this on a dime when, after the Soviet invasion, both in Congress
                    and in the administration, the view was we had to work with General Zia, the
                    president, the dictator of Pakistan. So Brzezinski came out. He offered $400
                    million worth of military assistance. Zia became famous for rejecting this,
                    saying it was peanuts, given the risks that Pakistan was asked to assume in
                    confronting a superpower in the neighboring territory. So we went back to the
                    drawing board and we agreed to what the Pakistanis really wanted, which was
                    F-16's, which was then a more powerful, potent aircraft than what India had. So
                    this created enormous uproar in India. This was in '80, '81. The covert
                    dimension of the relationship with Pakistan, which was led by the Agency, I
                    think developed more in the mid-Eighties, '84, '85, '86, with Pakistan. By
                    definition, that was very much less visible than had been the case before. By
                    that time we had a new prime minister in India, anyway, Rajiv Gandhi, the son of
                    Indira, who was much less abrasive than his mother had been and represented a
                    new generation, very much a difference in tone than had been the case
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one more question on this period. Did Kashmir play
                        any role while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Other than being just a longstanding issue, no I don't recall that it
                    was an element we followed closely or impacted the bilateral relationship. The
                    militants who, to this day, infiltrate and attack in Indian Kashmir itself were
                    not a factor at that time. So, no, I would not say it was.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just might add, I think we had, for a long time, a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: There's a, if I can use the term, there's a cadre of South Asianists in
                    the Department, people like myself who have been interested in the region and
                    sort of sought out assignments there. Not that many, but there have been some.
                    Then there are many more people who, unlike in my career which has been
                    overwhelmingly focused on South Asia, who will spend some time in the
                    subcontinent, then go on to other regions, back to Washington, work on other
                    issues and return years later.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: 'til 1986.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was deputy principal officer and political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I had two. The first consul general was Alex Rattray and the
                    second was Larry Grahl.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And '83 to '86, when you were there, what was the
                        situation, would you say, in Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, let me first comment about the consul general and this ties in
                    with the situation in Pakistan. I was told before coming to post, and I was
                    transferring directly from New Delhi, that the embassy in Islamabad had not
                    liked the reporting coming out of Karachi. Apparently it was too much focused on
                    reporting on the criticism of and opposition to the government of President
                    Zia-ul-Haq, General Zia-ul-Haq, who had seized power a few years before and had
                    executed the democratically elected prime minister, Mr. Bhutto. I don't know
                    what the particulars were of post reporting which displeased Ambassador Spiers
                    and others there but that was what I was told. So they appointed Alex Rattray,
                    who had been economic counselor in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, to be the
                    new CG and who turned out to be a first rate guy. I just mention this because
                    it's easy to get focused on the political environment but I think it's also
                    interesting in the context of what you and I are doing here in revisiting
                    history to talk a little bit about some of these other issues. And I want to get
                    back also to the relationship of a consulate to an embassy, at least as I
                    experienced it, because then I went on from Karachi to be consul general in
                    Lahore. So I spent a total of five years at subsidiary posts in the same
                    country.</p>

                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been dealing in South Asian affairs. Before you came
                        there, had you picked up this split between the consulate general and the
                        embassy? The very famous one with Arch Blood in the early Seventies, before
                        Bangladesh was formed. We've had other ones of this nature but the
                        Subcontinent seems particularly prone to this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I would differentiate. I would say that Pakistan seems particularly
                    prone to this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're right, because I really haven't heard much
                        about India but Pakistan seems to be prone to this. Just give a feel, for a
                        South Asian hand, before you went there, were you aware? Were people talking
                        about this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I honestly can't recall that they were. In my job in New Delhi, which
                    was focused on domestic politics, political reporting, I didn't really, I can't
                    recall tracking very closely what was going on inside Pakistan, much less on the
                    mood within our embassy there. So I can't comment on that. All I'm saying is
                    that this is what I was told in Washington and this accounted for the selection
                    of this particular gentleman as CG. As it turned out, Ambassador Spiers ended
                    his assignment and left Pakistan. In fact, I can't recall that he was even at
                    post when I arrived, I would have to check. Ambassador Deane Hinton then
                    succeeded him as ambassador and was a very different kind of individual and had
                    a very different attitude, as well, towards post reporting.</p>
                <p>Coming back to your first question on Pakistan. It was a very different Pakistan
                    than the one that we hear about and have heard have so much about, especially
                    since 9/11, yet Pakistan remains, was as internally divided then as it is now.
                    That has been its history since it was created back in 1947. What is today
                    Pakistan, West Pakistan, for many years was on the margins of British India and
                    less well integrated into the British Indian structure than what is today India
                    proper. So you have very deep ethnic and regional divisions. Now all of the
                    South Asian countries to some degree or the other face this but Pakistan more
                    than any of the other, by far, and they have fewer institutional mechanisms to
                    deal with this. As reflected in the fact that you've had constant oscillation
                    between democratically elected governments and military rule that extends to the
                    present day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well don't they have an institutional point of view, maybe
                        not from any other point of view but institutional point of view, don't they
                        have the same structure that India had? Didn't the British leave them with
                        the same structure? Was there something different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there were a number of important differences that over time were
                    crucial. First, you had difference in experience and perhaps even of quality of
                    leadership at the beginning. Nehru, who took over as prime minister of India
                    after being the leader of the Congress Party, second only to Mahatma Gandhi, had
                    a very deep seated commitment to the rule of law and parliamentary institutions.
                    But equally important, he remained on the scene for many, many years after
                    Indian independence. He died in 1964. So his instinctive reaction, as crises
                    arose in this new country, was to handle them in a way that was in accordance
                    with these democratic norms and parliamentary institutions.</p>
                <p>Pakistan, by contrast, its leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, died within a few months
                    of Pakistan becoming independent. He's considered the father of the nation of
                    Pakistan. It's hard to believe that Pakistan could have come into existence
                    without this man of tremendous will and capacity to impose it on others and to
                    arouse others as well. So that was a major blow to Pakistan. As I said earlier,
                    you had, I guess it's summed up by the fact that the very word Pakistan is an
                    acronym, it's an artificial word. It stands for Punjab, Afghanistan, Kashmir,
                    and Sind. The word was concocted by a student in London back in the early
                    Thirties, looking for a word that would have a common meaning to the Muslims of
                    South Asia, but focusing on the particular areas where they were in a majority.
                    And even then it did not include Bengal, what then became East Bengal, because
                    they didn't even think of the Bengalis as part of this movement. So when they
                    became independent, they patched together these entities which had never
                    historically in any sense cooperated or coexisted, even. The only common
                    denominator for them was that they happened to be Muslim. They were able to play
                    that card, the leaders of the Muslim League, who founded Pakistan, led by
                    Jinnah, were able to play that card for fifty years until Pakistan was
                    created.</p>
                <p>But when it came into existence, in the absence of their leader, who could play,
                    perhaps, the role that Nehru did, they were thrown on men of far lesser stature
                    and far less skill and far more rooted in their own ethnic and geographic and
                    regional roots. Jinnah had been a lawyer from Bombay, he wasn't even a Sunni
                    Muslim. He was not a practicing Muslim. He was the antithesis of the so-called
                    Islamic leader that we have in mind in the post-9/11 setting. So in a sense he
                    could appeal to everyone because he didn't belong to anyone. And from the very
                    beginning you had difficulties between East and West Pakistan, the east wing and
                    the west wing, as they used to call it, starting from the fact that East
                    Pakistan had a larger population than West Pakistan. And yet the leaders of West
                    Pakistan were not inclined to allow majority rule, because this would mean that
                    their institutions would be dominated by the Bengalis, for whom many of them had
                    the utmost scorn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to return to the situation in Karachi.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I mean all of this background info is relevant and came into play
                    within a few days of my arrival. Karachi, which - I should explain here - is
                    Pakistan's commercial center, a city today of ten to 15 million people, and also
                    an amalgam of different ethnic groups and Muslim sects. So within a few days of
                    my arrival, we had the Sindhis, the people who inhabit the interior of Sind, the
                    province in which Karachi is located on its coast, demonstrating in very
                    sustained ways, against the military regime, which they claimed was dominated by
                    Punjabis, led by General Zia himself, President Zia. In fact for my entire tour
                    there, we were focused, in our reporting, among other things, on the ethnic
                    tensions that existed in our consular district, which included Sind and
                    Baluchistan, the latter is the province that is south of Afghanistan and is east
                    of Iran, a very large province. There too, in Baluchistan, you had very strong
                    opposition to what they considered a Punjabi-led military government. Since the
                    Punjabis, who are the largest ethnic group of Pakistan, dominate the army, and
                    you had military rule and you had officers on detail supervising and overseeing
                    many aspects of local and provincial government, it became very focused on the
                    Punjabis.</p>
                <p>So the situation was different, as I say, from what it is today, twenty years
                    later, in that, while tensions were great, while there was occasional violence,
                    it was not Islamic focused. The Islamists who are so much a source of concern to
                    the U.S. government today, were part of the political woodwork but they didn't
                    take the lead. They had their steady seven to nine per cent of the vote and some
                    of their leaders were well known but Islam and the question of terrorism and
                    related violence were just not issues at that time. Very, very far from what
                    they are today. So we at the consulate, and I as the political officer, had
                    contacts with a broad spectrum of political opinion there and with public
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>As I said, Karachi is Pakistan's commercial capital. The business community of
                    Pakistan is overwhelmingly concentrated there. There are many very
                    sophisticated, very savvy, well traveled, well educated, well spoken people in
                    the professions, in business, in the media and so forth with whom we interacted
                    on a daily basis. That of course is our main role, if you will, in that
                    Islamabad, being an artificial city, a very new city, had become the capital of
                    Pakistan only in the early Seventies. Had become, technically, in the
                    mid-Sixties but the government offices only moved up there in the early
                    Seventies and was a totally artificial creation with just a population of
                    bureaucrats and politicians at that time. In many ways the real life of the
                    country was conducted in Karachi and in Lahore, which is why we had consulates
                    in both of those cities. So that was our job, to report on that.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I should mention that the Consulate General at that time was the third largest in
                    the world, believe it or not, after Hong Kong and Frankfurt. The reason is that
                    a large infrastructure of U.S. embassy, warehouse buildings and offices, and
                    residential properties had been developed in the Fifties and Sixties to support
                    our relationship with Pakistan, because Karachi was then the capital of
                    Pakistan. So when we moved those functions and built new facilities in Islamabad
                    we left behind all this quite modern, relatively new, well constructed, very
                    centrally located property that exceeded the needs of an average consulate. And
                    what do you do with it? One answer was to place other USG offices, such as
                    Customs, DEA, AID regional functions, etc. We had 80 US personnel stationed in
                    Karachi in the mid-80's.</p>
                <p>A very large percentage of your Pakistani visa applicants applied in Karachi and
                    were often referred to (us) by Islamabad. So we had a large consular operation
                    there. However, security was not a major focus. I cannot even recall whether we
                    had an RSO at post then. Since then, of course, Karachi has become a byword for
                    a vulnerable post, having been directly attacked a couple of times, and
                    witnessing the murder of several Consulate employees, threats, and the killing
                    of other foreigners in Karachi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, but still, wasn't there a concern about what had
                        happened in Islamabad in '79, the burning of our embassy? I mean, this is a
                        sudden mob taking off. This could have been stoked up. Wasn't it something
                        you were concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was something that we were well aware of. I myself, traveling from
                    Delhi, had attended a regional political officers meeting in Islamabad only a
                    few months after the attack and had walked through the charred floors of the
                    Embassy that had been set alight by the invading mob. At the time, the analysis
                    was that most of those who attacked the embassy were not Pakistanis but were
                    Palestinians, many of them, who were students at the university in Islamabad.
                    And it immediately followed and was precipitated by the terrorist assault on the
                    Grand Mosque in Mecca. So I think at the time it was viewed as sui generis and
                    did not necessarily imply that there was a wider threat to American facilities
                    and personnel in Islamabad or elsewhere in the country. Also, of course, when I
                    arrived in Karachi the incident had taken place four years earlier and there had
                    been no follow-through. The concern that we had, so far as there was one with
                    security, was more with Iran, because the Iranian Revolution had taken place,
                    and the seizure of U.S. hostages and there was a large Iranian consulate in
                    Karachi. I should add there were at least forty or fifty consulates in Karachi
                    at that time. It's a rather large diplomatic presence there.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>And there were many refugees who came out of Iran, such as Zoroastrians, or just
                    people who found life impossible to live in Iran itself and they would come
                    across the border into Baluchistan and would make their way to Karachi. Many
                    were young men who were evading, escaping military draft. You recall the
                    Iranians would just throw human waves of so-called religious volunteers in an
                    attack on the Iraqis, and families who didn't want their sons to be caught up in
                    that would send them out. Many of them would turn up on us, looking for visas to
                    go to the United States.</p>
                <p>The attack on the embassy in '79 had receded in our consciousness at that time,
                    as I recall. I'm speaking more than twenty years later. But it was not an
                    overwhelming, dominant concern. Again, I have to emphasize, and I've seen it,
                    myself, as a DCM in Saudi Arabia and India, years later, that our focus, total
                    focus, on security is a relatively new thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First place, sort of the overall thing, was there, from
                        the Karachi perspective and all, and when you had been in India, was there
                        any real desire of India to take over Pakistan and was there any real desire
                        of Pakistan to go to India? Was there any movement there at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, certainly, India accepts the existence of Pakistan. No, the
                    Indo-Pak issue did not come to any head at that time. The Indians were concerned
                    that the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan had resulted in closer ties between
                    the U.S. and Pakistan and that we were providing military assistance to this
                    military regime and that therefore this could pose a threat to them over the
                    longer term, but no. You had many people in Karachi, in fact the city itself,
                    the majority of people, are so-called muhajirs, which means refugees, and are
                    considered almost a distinct ethnic group in Pakistan. These are Muslims of many
                    backgrounds who had left India in 1947 and for years thereafter and had settled
                    in Pakistan. Most of them came to Karachi. So there was a large Indian consulate
                    in Karachi and many people would travel back and forth to visit relatives and
                    visit religious shrines and so forth in India. So it was not a high point of
                    tension between the two countries at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what were you getting about, was there a tremendous
                        disconnect in this very diverse society in Karachi and the outskirts? Was
                        this a stronghold of Bhutto?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: There were, yeah, the Bhuttos themselves are Sindhis. Benazir Bhutto,
                    the daughter of the Bhutto who had been executed, had her home in Karachi. The
                    consul general, particularly Larry Grahl but also Alex Rattray previously, kept
                    in regular contact with her and with people around her, as I did. She went to
                    jail at that time for a period and we made it a point to maintain contact. This
                    was not done not only to seek her views and thoughts on the current situation
                    but it was also a signal we were sending to the regime that we disapproved of
                    their crackdown on the political parties, that we supported democratic
                    institutions, and a signal as well to the supporters of these parties that we
                    were not so in bed with the military that we ignored or neglected them. We
                    wanted to keep in touch with them. We wanted to have them come periodically to
                    the United States. We wanted to engage in discussions with them. So in our
                    representational work, we and I, particularly as a political officer, and the CG
                    himself as well were constantly entertaining and receiving these opposition
                    personalities and political people in general. Not only Miss Bhutto's party, the
                    Pakistan People's Party but the Muslim League and others as well. An important
                    part of our job was to keep in touch with these folks, doing so, I stress, with
                    the full endorsement of the Embassy and Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, again, a certain disconnect that Islamabad
                        and its area of interest and your area of interest were quite different.
                        Islamabad, maybe, was more focused on the war in Afghanistan and the support
                        we were giving. I would think Afghanistan would be far away from Karachi, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I don't think so. Ambassador Hinton was a regular visitor, four, five
                    times a year, six times a year, he would come down, if only for a day or two and
                    often for a longer period. In addition, at his urging, the Embassy would bring
                    together in Islamabad the political, economic officers, and consular officers on
                    a regular basis to make sure we kept in touch with each other. There was a
                    concern, both in Washington and I think on his part, he perhaps having been
                    briefed on this and he deeply believed it, that it was important to keep the
                    mission, the country team, defined in the widest possible way, in contact and
                    the DCM did so as well. Under his leadership, we were never guided, if you will,
                    told what we should be reporting or not reporting or taken to task for reporting
                    that might be different from that of the embassy. Moreover, we reported directly
                    to Washington without going through the embassy which, if I'm not mistaken, had
                    been the case before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine, usually if there's any dispute, the
                        embassy usually says, “Don't do this.” What about, how did the Afghan War
                        business between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance forces, how did that
                        play in Karachi, in your area during the time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not very much. I think the high point of the U.S. support for the
                    mujahideen was more in the mid-Eighties and later. I'd say from '85 to '88 or
                    so. So a little bit later than the period that I'm referring to here now. The
                    main impact felt in Karachi was the refugees. The Soviet occupation of
                    Afghanistan resulted in an outflow of up to two million Afghan refugees and they
                    were concentrated in camps all along the border, both in the Northwest Frontier
                    Province and in Baluchistan. But many of the Pathans came also to Karachi and in
                    fact the port, the stevedores and the labor connected with the port of Karachi,
                    which was a rather major operation, was overwhelmingly Pathan. And there were
                    certain industries, certain sectors like transportation, that they dominated.
                    And there were sections of outlying areas of the town, of the city, where
                    Pathans were concentrated. But as an issue, as something that intruded directly
                    on us, no, not that much.</p>
                <p>As I said, our consular district included Baluchistan province. As the political
                    officer, I regularly traveled to Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, probably
                    three or four times a year, usually with an FSN, a tremendous fellow who knew
                    everything and everyone. There I saw the impact of the war in Afghanistan much
                    closer up because the refugee camps were nearby. And the influx of Pathans had
                    greatly disturbed the ethnic balance within Baluchistan between the Baluchis and
                    Pathans which had existed before. And there were rumors of tribesmen crossing
                    over from Baluchistan to go into Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. In other
                    words, some of these camps would be used as staging areas. So, as I say, in
                    Baluchistan you certainly saw that closer up.</p>
                <p>W: I would think that in normal circumstances there would be considerable
                    concern, particularly in those days, of Iranian aggression but at that point
                    Iran was so busy fighting for its life with the Iraqis that this sort of took
                    care of that, at least for a time.</p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, the Pakistani government worked hard to maintain a good
                    relationship with Iran. About 15 per cent of the population of Pakistan is Shia.
                    Today and in fact for the last eight to ten years, there have been very severe
                    sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shias and with lots of mutual murders and
                    assassinations and mass killings. That did not exist at the time but there was a
                    concern, definitely, on the part of the security agencies and the government of
                    Pakistan that the Pakistani Shia might become influenced by the Iranians. So
                    they worked hard to maintain a good relationship with Iran and to provide them
                    as little rationale for interference in Pakistan and by and large I think they
                    were successful in that regard. And as you say, the Iranians were preoccupied
                    with their own affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it later became an issue so raising it for the time,
                        was anybody looking at what was preached in the madrassas? These were what,
                        the religious schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not so much, no. The attention that we gave to the Islamic parties, and
                    this was more, later, when I was in Lahore as CG, was more on the leaders of
                    those parties and their views about the United States, about U.S. policies and
                    attempting to talk to them about why we were working with Zia, why we had good
                    intentions towards Muslims, why we believed that they should work with other
                    political parties in a democratic political context. But in terms of their local
                    base and the role of madrassas, no, that was not a major concern, as I recall. I
                    have to emphasize that in an era when terrorism was not the front-and-center
                    issue regarding our outlook on the internal politics of Pakistan, the US focus
                    was on promoting democratic institutions and an environment in which they might
                    flourish. Hence, our constant effort to be in active touch with all elements of
                    the political spectrum. It was a more innocent era, I suppose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention the security agencies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Pakistani security agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pakistani security agencies. Were they sort of all
                        pervasive? Did one feel that they were watching everyone? Were they a
                        power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They may have been a power but they were not, there was no secret
                    police a la Communist regimes or elsewhere. This was an autocratic rather than a
                    totalitarian regime, as Jeane Kirkpatrick might put it. The army ran the
                    country, not the intelligence agencies. So you had military officers in key
                    positions. A lot of this was mediated, I should say, band in a sense, you only
                    appreciate this by living there - by the fact that Pakistanis are gregarious,
                    outgoing, very friendly people, very warm hearted people - and military officers
                    are no exception. Family connection and school and other personal ties are
                    all-important there. That's how everything gets done. Military officers, many of
                    them, were from the same social strata as the people that you dealt with and you
                    saw. They were not a caste apart, sort of glaring over everyone's shoulder and
                    keeping people in line. It didn't work that way. Many of them occupied their
                    positions to feather their own nest, this was a great opportunity to enrich
                    themselves. Now of course as diplomats we weren't there engaging in anything
                    that would attract their attention, or at least we hoped, anyway, beyond keeping
                    an eye on our activities. But in the society as a whole, no, I did not feel they
                    were watching everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't people whispering that “Let's not talk here”
                        or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, quite the contrary, quite the contrary. They were very vocal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about corruption. Was this an issue that was really
                        affecting the operation of the country and were we looking at it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: We were not looking at it. You know, everyone has his own definition of
                    corruption. As I said a moment ago, the country operates, the society operates,
                    on the basis of personal relationships and school ties and all of that as much
                    as by law and regulation and established practice. And so we would not be
                    directly confronted with this, except that our officers had to be definitely
                    aware that our FSNs could be the target of those willing to pay bribes to them
                    in the hope that they could facilitate visa issuance. This is not a problem
                    limited to Pakistan, by the way. More broadly, you would have journalists who
                    would tell you that there are payoffs, that military officers could not live the
                    way they did without having additional source of income than their salaries. Not
                    to mention many of the politicians who had come up in life as well. So that was
                    there. We were not their nannies, so to speak, watching and documenting this and
                    reporting on it, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you say the United States, I mean, again, you're
                        dealing with a certain group, I mean the people you deal with, and how did
                        they regard the United States, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there was a lot of cynicism about the United States in the sense
                    that the common, constant theme, heard all the time, was that we talked the talk
                    about democracy but didn't walk the walk. Especially so in Karachi, being a
                    political town where the political parties were suppressed or under the thumb of
                    the military but yet not in jail, with the exception of Benazir Bhutto and a few
                    others, but not in any way afraid to speak their minds. The press was relatively
                    uncensored and I have to empathize that point and lots of newspapers were quite
                    critical of Zia. The cynicism was nothing new in that I heard it often in other
                    countries as well, namely that “you Americans claim to support democracy but
                    you're also in bed with the military dictator of Pakistan. We who are members of
                    democratic parties, committed to everything you say you stand for, are not
                    allowed to play the role that we should be nor is our country able to function
                    on a democratic basis while you Americans are not only tolerant of but highly
                    supportive of President Zia.” It's exactly the same view that you hear today
                    with President Musharraf, also a military dictator. Otherwise, let me just say,
                    there was a very positive view of the United States as reflected by the desire
                    to study in the U.S., to travel to the U.S., by the family ties with the U.S.
                    that were widespread. As in India, I never encountered any hostility, on a
                    personal basis. So it was put forth on this sort of rhetorical level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find our exchange program or our visitors program
                        a valuable instrument?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: It's always valuable to have exchanges and particularly for Pakistanis
                    to travel to the United States. And I was on the all-agency Mission panel that
                    selected candidates from a national pool, traveling to Islamabad to ensure that
                    our consular district got its share of IV (International Visitor) grantees, and
                    to defend or promote our recommendations. We had to vet our selection of IV
                    program participants with the government. We could not willy nilly send someone
                    to the U.S. They had to be approved. So in a practical sense that limited the
                    categories of people we could invite to those who were “relatively safe” from
                    the regime's point of view. So you had to work hard to identify those people for
                    whom it would be a very meaningful experience but at the same time be able to
                    get the government's approval. But that's always a very valuable program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for, this is sort of mid-Reagan in
                        American terms, a feel for how the Reagan Administration, at that particular
                        time, viewed Pakistan and in contrast to India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, obviously with India led by Mrs. Gandhi and given some of the
                    issues that I described in our earlier session, there was no love lost for the
                    Indian government and for Indian policy on the part of many in the USG and in
                    fact deep anger in some respects. By contrast, with Pakistan you had this close
                    and deepening relationship between the government of Pakistan and the
                    administration. The ambassador had, if not total access, something very close to
                    it across the top of the GOP. The vice president, Vice President George H.W.
                    Bush, visited on one occasion. Keep in mind, as an expression of how close that
                    relationship was, that General Zia died in a plane crash accompanied by the
                    American ambassador, Arnie Raphel. The other American who was on board that
                    aircraft was the commanding general of the military assistance program. That's
                    not a traveling team that you would have seen in India, believe me. So, yes,
                    very different views by Washington of our relationship with the two
                    governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there in '83 to '86 were there any
                        incidents or developments we haven't touched on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The key one, the one that is seared in my memory, was the murder of two
                    of our AID regional auditors based in Karachi. They were not murdered in
                    Pakistan. They were on an aircraft that was hijacked by Palestinian terrorists
                    at Kuwait airport and flown to Teheran where they landed. This was in '84 or
                    '85. The hijackers identified all of the Americans who were in the aircraft and,
                    as I recall, these two gentlemen had official passports, perhaps even diplomatic
                    passports. They were brought to the front of the plane, of the aircraft and were
                    shot, and their bodies were dumped on the tarmac. So these were two men whom we
                    knew very well and whose families lived in our midst, who were down the hall, if
                    you will, from us in the office building. That was a very shocking event.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The summer in which I left, in 1986, within days of my departure from Karachi but
                    prior to arriving in Lahore, terrorists took over a Pan Am aircraft at Karachi
                    airport and murdered several passengers on board before the Pakistani special
                    forces attacked the aircraft and there was a gun battle. The terrorists were
                    killed but others were also killed, including American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I believe they were Palestinians, also. As I say, it was the pre-al
                    Qaeda, pre -Islamist kind of terrorism that we've become all too familiar with.
                    But it was a precursor to the terrorism that became more frequent in
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In '86 I was assigned to Lahore. Ambassador Hinton very much wanted
                    someone who knew something about Pakistan in Lahore. I had just been promoted to
                    FS-1 and therefore was at grade for the principal officer position, having been
                    deputy PO in Karachi, and the Ambassador made the assignment happen. While
                    Karachi is the economic and business capital of Pakistan, Lahore is the
                    political capital of Pakistan, because it's the capital of Punjab province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well now you were in Lahore from...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: '86 to '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, compare and contrast, as they say in college.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Looking at the consulate first, it was a much smaller operation than
                    Karachi, for the reasons that I've mentioned. We had about 20 or 25 U.S. direct
                    hire positions, plus dozens of Pakistani employees, while today the consulate
                    barely hangs on with a very small handful of personnel - a reflection of how
                    things have changed there. We had a large AID presence in Pakistan, in
                    Islamabad, as a result of our support for the Pakistan government; in addition
                    to the military aid component to the US-Pakistan relationship, there was a very
                    strong economic support dimension also, and AID worked very closely with the
                    local electric utility in Punjab. And so there was an AID contingent in Lahore;
                    in addition, there was a DEA office of three agents, DEA agents, who worked with
                    their Pak counterparts, a significant consular operation, and USIA as well. We
                    had our own library and a very active information and cultural program. And we
                    also had FBO, because we built a new consulate building there during the time
                    that I was there, at least we started construction of it. The biggest
                    difference, of course, was that I was principal officer, although in Karachi, I
                    should add, for about six months I had been acting PO between CGs.</p>
                <p>So for me, personally and career-wise, it was an opportunity to expand my
                    management experience. We were significantly closer geographically to Islamabad
                    than Karachi was. Karachi represented a major trip, a thousand miles from
                    Islamabad. That was one reason why personal contact between the embassy and the
                    consulate wasn't as frequent as it was with Lahore, where you could just drive
                    down in a matter of a few hours, not to mention a flight of only thirty or forty
                    minutes. So we had many more embassy visitors. It also put me in contact with
                    the political leadership, if you will, of Pakistan. Not in the sense of the
                    ministers in Islamabad but with many of the second and third tier politicians
                    who could aspire to national leadership roles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could they exist in a military government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Oh, yes, in fact there was a lot of co-opting, particularly of one of
                    the major parties, called the Muslim League, there was a lot of cooperation.
                    Remember that politics there is built on a society organized around clans,
                    around caste groups, around tribes, around business relationships. In a poor
                    country like Pakistan, the ability to deliver benefits to your followers, to
                    your dependents, depends a lot on access to government and you cannot cut
                    yourself off from them. Now in Karachi, which was the focus of the country's
                    international trade and foreign investment, you were less dependent on that than
                    you were in Punjab. There the politicians were mostly major landowners. There
                    had been no significant land reform in Pakistan, as there was in India. In
                    India, for example, it's very rare, it's almost unheard of and it's probably
                    illegal, to have more than, to own more than a few hundred acres. Now you can
                    get around it, there are ways of getting around it. But all of the big so-called
                    zamindars, which is a local term for big landlords, were swept away in India in
                    the Fifties. That did not happen in Pakistan. So you have, I believe to this
                    day, people who own thousands and thousands of acres and own villages and in
                    fact, if you will, own the villagers. That's the way their society is organized.
                    These often are tribal leaders, as well. So these are the people who are in
                    politics and the senior ranks of the military. So they work closely together and
                    the Muslim League is particularly identified with them in Punjab but even others
                    as well. So, as a result, many of these men can aspire to play national roles.
                    As I look at the composition of today's Pakistani government I recognize many
                    names of people I knew at the time, who were younger men then. So it was a
                    different experience. I understand that today, the Islamist factor is much
                    stronger and is largely divorced from these traditional elites. In my day in
                    Lahore (and Karachi,) the Islamists were marginal players.</p>
                <p>At that time, Ambassador Hinton, who had been a very strong supporter, if I may
                    say so, having ensured that I was assigned to Lahore, left Pakistan and was
                    succeeded by Ambassador Arnold Raphel, who was also a good friend and had had
                    previous experience in our region. He and I had worked on the desk together at
                    one point, he on Pakistan and I on India. He regularly came down to Lahore and I
                    would often travel up to Islamabad. So my relations with the embassy were still
                    closer, if you will, than they had been in Karachi. Of course, being principal
                    officer I had that additional entr�e to the embassy. In some ways Lahore was
                    very similar to Karachi, in that the American consul general has a very high
                    profile. Unlike Karachi, where there, as I said, were fifty or sixty consulates,
                    in Lahore there were only two: the U.S. and the Iranian.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I will cite an anecdote here. President Zia would frequently visit Lahore,
                    because of the provincial capital, official business, the military corps
                    headquarters was also in Lahore near the Indian border. His plane would land at
                    Lahore airport and the foreign ministry, which maintained a protocol office,
                    would summon the diplomatic corps to the tarmac to greet the president. It
                    seemed to me at times that I was always on my way to the airport. With the
                    diplomatic corps consisting of myself and my Iranian counterpart, they would
                    always place us side by side. Our instructions on contacts were very strict at
                    that time. So I might shake hands with him, say, “How are you? Hello” and that
                    would be it. There was never any substantive discussion. And I asked our chief
                    of protocol, a good friend, “Why do you place us next to each other?” He
                    replied, “We're all amused to see you guys react to each other.”</p>
                <p>But the U.S. consul general cuts a very wide swath in the local papers, in the
                    local social affairs. So I was a very visible personality and the
                    representational obligations were very, very heavy. You once asked if I had any
                    children. I have two boys but they both went to boarding school. One of these
                    interviews should talk in some ways about the personal dimension. I don't know
                    how often this has come up in some of your sessions with other people, but a big
                    factor for Foreign Service families assigned to countries overseas is, first,
                    whether there's an American school and secondly whether the American school is
                    accredited. That accreditation is very important and particularly for high
                    school because it forces you to decide whether your children will study there at
                    that American school or whether you'll send them elsewhere. And so for a family
                    this is an important decision to make.</p>
                <p>I should add that in Karachi my wife had taught at the American school, as she
                    had also taught at the American school in Delhi fulltime. When we came to Lahore
                    she taught there as well but the high school was not accredited and so we made
                    the decision to send our children to boarding school in the United States. So
                    when I mention all of these representational activities which would tie you up
                    five or six nights a week, we were able to do that in part because our kids were
                    not there. Although in the first year, my younger son was in the eighth grade
                    and again, just to give that family dimension of it, he was one of the very few
                    Americans in the eighth grade. All of his friends and peers were the sons of
                    very wealthy Pakistani businessmen, the ones who could afford to pay the tuition
                    at the school. I recall one evening, he came home quite late. He had been out
                    with his friends, something I wasn't too happy about, particularly the hour at
                    which he returned, and then he told us that they'd had been joyriding in a car
                    and the police, when it stopped them, the driver of the car had just paid a
                    bribe to the policeman to get them out of whatever jam they were in. I said to
                    my wife, “This is the mindset here and I don't think it's a very healthy one for
                    an American kid to be exposed to.” His brother had already gone off to school
                    and we decided we should do that for him, as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The Consul General's duties often extend in directions that few folks in
                    Washington give much thought to, much less ensure that it be listed in your
                    typical job description, but they can be very time-consuming. One of the more
                    unpleasant experiences of my Foreign Service career occurred in Lahore where I
                    was honorary chairman of the school board, representing the ambassador. This
                    involved the Lahore American School. Someone on our staff discovered that the
                    school had two tuition rates, one expressed in dollars and one in Pakistani
                    rupees and the conversion rate had not been adjusted in several years. So
                    Pakistani parents who paid tuition in Pakistani rupees, and the school needed
                    Pakistani rupees to operate, were paying a significantly lesser amount than the
                    dollar equivalent paid by the USG to cover the tuition of our American
                    employees' children, absolutely contrary to U.S. government regulation. So I had
                    to push this through and it represented a very significant and immediate
                    increase in tuition for Pakistani parents and it faced enormous opposition and
                    incredible resistance. But it was very clear what we had to do, if they were
                    going to remain an American school, under the ambassador's patronage. So, we got
                    it through the board (all Pakistanis) but in the process, I really got a closer
                    look at the less pleasant side of the Pakistani character, if you will. As I
                    say, I remember that this whole issue persisted over a period of several months
                    and became something that was very time consuming. Everything would be referred
                    to me as if I should arbitrate. I couldn't impose it; the board had to come to
                    that decision itself. I simply said this is what the regulation is and I have to
                    demand that you implement it. So it's a dimension of a consul general's work
                    that I don't think exists at the embassy level and it's one you never hear about
                    when you talk about policy issues. But in the here and now it was a big issue
                    for me to deal with.</p>
                <p>Not to mention also the construction of the consulate building, which required a
                    great deal of effort to work the local bureaucracy, to support the FBO employee
                    who was project manager, and to ensure - you were referring to corruption
                    earlier - to ensure that our requirements of accountability, transparency, and
                    of honest value for honest money be adhered to. So this, too, was a major
                    preoccupation for me throughout my time in Lahore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any message, goal or something? Here you are
                        with essentially a military, I don't know if you want to call it rule, a
                        dictatorship yet you're going out to the political class and you've
                        mentioned before they're looking at you with a bit with cynicism. What were
                        you doing, sort of political wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, by being there and interacting with these people on a constant
                    basis, we had in a sense our talking points and we would use them over and over
                    again. We had a policy message which I've described before and which was carried
                    over to Lahore. The very fact of our being physically present was very important
                    because we were not only a sounding board, we could be a punching bag. In other
                    words, they could vent with us, get it off their chests, and then hear an
                    American official respond to them. I think that's a role that's hard to quantify
                    but which is very important. And then you would travel out of Lahore to the
                    district level, to some major cities in Punjab province to deliver that same
                    message. You would tell people your door was open, so you're in town, come and
                    look me up so we can talk about these issues. That was an important part of it.
                    The same with the public affairs office. And you work together on these issues,
                    working with the media.</p>
                <p>So the consular operation becomes very important in this regard, too, in the
                    sense that we issued, at that time, many visas, it was a relatively high visa
                    application/acceptance rate. The people who went to the US tended to be, through
                    their family or themselves personally, were well-connected. The fact that
                    notwithstanding their criticism of us they qualified for a visa in itself was an
                    important message. As was the attitude that the consular officers displayed
                    toward them, and you were always careful to make sure that their political views
                    did not intrude on whether they qualified for a visa. And you talk to them,
                    these were mostly junior officers, about the need for respect and courtesy and
                    so forth, even when you knew someone was a critic of the United States. So it's
                    a posture that your office maintains which is important there. There's a
                    fundamental goodwill towards the United States or at least there was at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of consular matters, was there a problem of
                        Pakistanis trying to get maids into the United States or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not so much on my watch but in Pakistan generally, I'm told, there were
                    problems. Not so much with maids as with ineligible family members or young men
                    who claimed to be students seeking to go to the United States. It's always a
                    problem with Third World countries; it was a problem in India, as I have already
                    mentioned being raised by the Indian prime minister. People who have no ties,
                    and they'd say, “Well, I'm 22, what kind of ties to do want? I'm not married,
                    I'm not this, I'm not that.” So you have to balance that. You had to constantly
                    be aware of the temptation to which our FSN employees were subjected, that they
                    faced. Not to mention our junior officers. I recall a junior officer, this was
                    when I was in Lahore, who received a letter, an anonymous note in the mail,
                    saying, “Dear Mr. So-and-so, you don't know me but I know who you are. If you
                    are interested in making up to $500,000, please meet me at the Hilton Hotel at
                    such-and-such a time.” He showed this to me. So the incredible demand for visas
                    generated these pressures. People, often very important in local politics or the
                    business community or otherwise, would refer visa applicants to you and the
                    question was, how do you respond to them? This is something that I learned at a
                    very early stage in my career and that I kept foremost in my mind to the last
                    day before retiring. There is such demand for American visas that you have to be
                    exceedingly careful in what you tell people, neither encouraging them, nor
                    misleading them, nor brushing them off, keeping in mind at all times the
                    responsibility placed by law on the consular officer. More important, as a
                    manager, and I was a manager for almost twenty years, you have to make sure the
                    message you give to your officers on the issuance of visas and the approach they
                    should take, is one that is in accordance with all of our precepts. It's very
                    important, really important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lahore is close to the Indian border.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I was talking with Steve Eisenbraun, asking him
                        about Indian-Pak relations, as seen from Lahore. Can you talk about
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I recall very well, on my consultations in Washington, between
                    Karachi and Lahore, the one and only time I was told this, that we do not want
                    any reporting from Lahore on Sikh activities in Pakistan. It was explained to me
                    that as we were developing our relationship with General Zia and with the
                    Pakistanis in support of the mujahideen and the anti-Soviet groups in
                    Afghanistan, in a sense we did not want the Zia government's image tarnished in
                    Washington by allegations that they were supporting Sikh terrorists in India.
                    The time that I'm referring to was a period of enormous unrest in Indian Punjab.
                    Punjab is a province that before independence was administered as a single unit
                    and then was split between India and Pakistan. All the Hindus and Sikhs who
                    lived in what is today Pakistan moved to India and the Muslims on the Indian
                    side to Pakistan. Zia himself was one of these Punjabi refugees. In India,
                    particularly after attack on the Golden Temple, which led to the assassination
                    of Mrs. Gandhi in 1984, there was a campaign of terrorism by Sikh militants
                    against the Indian government, which was repressed using absolutely brutal
                    methods.</p>
                <p>Now, it was a great temptation for the Pakistanis to encourage and support this,
                    just as they had been (and still are doing) with Kashmiris and Kashmir. We'll
                    get to that when we get to my more recent assignment in India. They had a good
                    way of doing that, because there are several major Sikh shrines in what is today
                    Pakistan and they would allow groups of “pilgrims” to come over to visit those
                    shrines. General Zia who was himself born in what is today Indian Punjab and
                    speaks the local dialect, always made a point of meeting the Sikh pilgrim groups
                    and could speak to them in their own language. Punjabis are a unique people,
                    they are great people, whatever their religion, highly gregarious, and their
                    language is famous for its level of humor. Zia, a quintessential Punjabi, loved
                    that repartee. So there was an instant bonding. So I think he felt, both on a
                    personal level and also on a state level, that a little bit of support kept the
                    Indians off balance. So I was told, it was made very clear to me, that
                    Washington didn't want any reporting on that. Occasionally you would hear things
                    and see things. I mean, Sikhs are very distinctive, just by their dress and
                    physical appearance. And you would hear things. There were some Sikhs who
                    converted to Islam at the time of partition in 1947, so as not to lose their
                    land in Pakistan, but they still had those family ties. So they would tell you
                    things about what was going on along the border only 15 miles away. Otherwise,
                    it's a heavily fortified border. Both sides have major military contingents that
                    line it and there are major military installations along the boundary between
                    India and Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told, again, I think, by Eisenbraun, that Pakistanis
                        kind of looked upon India, where they would go over the border, as kind of
                        like going to Las Vegas. I mean, it was a lot more colorful. But maybe this
                        was a different era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, there wasn't much traffic across the border. There was more from
                    Karachi, mainly because the people in Karachi, the so-called muhajirs, or
                    refugees, came from northern India, central India. They didn't live along the
                    border. They could fly in and out. There wasn't much traffic back and forth, at
                    that time, between the two Punjabs.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in Lahore, was the action in Afghanistan reflected
                        there or were you pretty far from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I would say we were pretty far from it except, again, for the question
                    of the refugee camps in far western Punjab. There were far fewer Pathans in
                    Lahore than there were in Karachi. So we were all aware of it and there was very
                    strong anti-Soviet feeling and very strong emotional support for the Afghans but
                    otherwise I would not say that it impinged on Lahore directly. There were no
                    terrorist attacks. There was no overflow from Afghanistan onto Punjab, if you
                    will, other than, as I say, the presence of some refugees, although not many.
                    There were not many in Punjab province compared to the Northwest Frontier
                    Province and Baluchistan which together took in millions of Afghans, literally.
                    By contrast, Punjab sheltered only a few thousand, probably a deliberate
                    decision by the Punjabi establishment that runs Pakistan, in my view at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kashmir, I realize later you'll be more involved but
                        did Kashmir raise itself much while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Not really, although interestingly a good third of the population of
                    Lahore is of Kashmiri origin. Not so much the result of Partition in 1947 as
                    much as 19th century urban migration. The chief minister himself of Punjab,
                    Nawaz Sharif, who later became prime minister of Pakistan, was an ethnic
                    Kashmiri. That did not endear him to many Punjabis who are very conscious of
                    their ethnic origins. But as an issue, no, I would not say at that time. It
                    became so much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You find the political class that you were dealing with in
                        Lahore a different kettle of fish than the one in Karachi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes and no. There were far fewer businessmen involved in politics in
                    Lahore than in Karachi. As I mentioned earlier, with the exception of Nawaz
                    Sharif, who was himself a businessman, but again he had no deep ties in the
                    province. His father had built up a steel business. There was a very large
                    number of military, ex-military folks who when they retired from the army went
                    back to their lands or established businesses and then went into politics. So to
                    that extent there was that difference, yes. Just a different tone of politics
                    because Punjab is the majority province of Pakistan. In Sind and Karachi and
                    Baluchistan it was all the “we against them.” We're the minorities who are being
                    stepped on by the Punjabis. Obviously in Punjab you didn't have that
                    sentiment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any aftermath of the loss of the “East Wing”,
                        Bangladesh?</hi>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Good riddance I think was the reaction, to the extent that it came up
                    at all, which I don't recall it ever did, in any substantive way. On a popular
                    level, people would say that being rid of East Pakistan was the best thing that
                    ever happened to Pakistan. There was never any emotional bond between the two
                    wings or regions, that's for sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any events in India that were reverberating
                        while you were in Lahore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, I can't think of any, even though close as we were to India. I mean
                    our focus was overwhelmingly on what was going on in Pakistan. No, I don't
                    recall that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense any discontent or potential for problems

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, no, the level of politics and the agendas that the politicians
                    fought over were dressed up in democratic and populist language but it was
                    essentially a fight over the spoils of the system, not any fundamental reform.
                    You always had a few, but no. There is a very different tone and content to
                    politics in Pakistan than in India.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: No, that had limited resonance in Pakistan, other than periodic
                    populist spasms by the Pakistan People's Party founded by Bhutto and now
                    identified with his daughter. On the other hand, if you're implying by that a
                    pro-private enterprise rhetoric, no, that didn't exist, either. It was “who's on
                    top and who's getting what out of the system.” That's really what it boiled down
                    to.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: No. We circulated at all levels. In Karachi, the consul general's
                    residence has to be seen to be believed. It was the ambassador's residence
                    before the embassy move to Islamabad and a very nice home, by any standard. I
                    was in the DCM residence, the former DCM residence, also a nice home by any
                    standard, especially in Pakistan. No, that was never an issue. Nor in Lahore,
                    where I had a very nice residence. Again, these are very status oriented
                    societies. Foreigners, whatever their economic and social situation at home, are
                    immediately admitted, given pretty free access. And if you're a senior U.S.
                    government official in their country, you have access to just about anyone you
                    want and you're invited constantly, because you'll add to the status of your
                    hosts by accepting their invitation and attending their function. I should add
                    that some of that mentality also exists among American hosts in Washington. Now,
                    if I had been like the charg� d'affaires of a certain European country in
                    Guinea, I mention this as an anecdote, whose official car was a Volkswagen
                    Beetle, complete with flag, and where he would pull up to a reception or a
                    government ministry, his driver would then run out and open the door for him on
                    the other side, then you become a bit of a joke. But I had a very nice Buick,
                    heavily armored. We had 19 people, retainers, at the consul general's residence,
                    if you add the cooks and the gardeners and the security people and you name
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after this modest life you were living, in '88
                        whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Let me just conclude by, as I mentioned, days after Karachi there was
                    the attack on the Pan Am plane. Within a month or so of my departure from Lahore
                    there was a terrible tragedy in which Ambassador Raphel and President Zia died
                    in a plane crash, having taken off from Lahore airport. There was much
                    speculation that there had been some kind of tampering with the engine, that
                    this was a planned assassination. But having very, very frequently seen the
                    Pakistani presidential aircraft and the way in which it would land and without
                    any real maintenance or attention then take off again, and it was not a new
                    aircraft, it didn't surprise me that the Pakistani government has always claimed
                    it was mechanical difficulty. That was a very credible account to me, rather
                    than some convoluted explanation otherwise.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>From Lahore I was then assigned to Kathmandu, Nepal as DCM. I was there from '88
                    to '91. I was selected by Ambassador Milton Frank, who was a political appointee
                    who wanted someone who knew the region. The Department had proposed a number of
                    candidates and he had narrowed them down to three or four and interviewed me in
                    the State Department cafeteria in Washington and we immediately clicked. So he
                    selected me to be his DCM. To me it was a great opportunity to build on my
                    previous management experience to become a DCM, although at the time people told
                    me, cautioned me, “You're spending too many years in South Asia. In fact, you've
                    been overseas now since '79. Here it is 1988, nine years. You should think of a
                    Washington assignment and you should start thinking of other regions than just
                    South Asia.” I had been told that earlier, even before going to Lahore. I didn't
                    disregard that advice lightly but I've always been a great believer that
                    there's, in a sense, a larger scheme of things and it's impossible , at least I
                    have so found, to game the system. You think you're structuring your career path
                    in a certain way and there's so many ways in which it can be thrown off. So you
                    respond to the opportunities that are given to you as they come along. It was in
                    that spirit that I sought the job and was happy to receive it.</p>
                <p>So I was there from '88 to '91 as DCM. First with Ambassador Frank, who was a
                    Ronald Reagan appointee. He had been the public affairs or relations officer for
                    the University of California system, not just an individual campus like Berkeley
                    or UCLA but for the system as a whole and had been on the margins of the Reagan
                    kitchen cabinet in California politics. He was a former air force office, a
                    career air force officer and in fact had served in the India-Burma-China theater
                    back in the 1940's, as a pilot flying the famous Hump. That's what interested
                    him in coming back to the region and he was able to land the Nepal job as
                    ambassador. But it was in the final year of the Reagan Administration. As I
                    said, this was in '88. The election occurred in that year and President Bush '41
                    was elected. Ambassador Frank tried valiantly to remain on as ambassador. After
                    all, he was a Republican and it was another Republican administration but it
                    doesn't work that way in Washington. I won't go into the ins and outs, although
                    if you're interested I can. But he was not successful in getting that extension
                    and so he left after only one year. Ambassador Julia Chang Bloch, also a
                    Republican political appointee, became ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also from California.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Also from California. A very interesting, impressive lady with whom I
                    worked very closely. She was the first Asian-American ambassador ever and was
                    very proud of that fact. She had been born in China, come at the age of eight or
                    nine to the United States. She was a political appointee, and I think her ties
                    are to Senator Mitch McConnell, her sponsor, guru if you will, from Kentucky and
                    her husband is a well to do businessman, based here in Washington. But, in fact,
                    she had considerable relevant experience. She had previously been a Peace Corps
                    volunteer in Malaysia, worked on the Hill, but then beginning with Reagan
                    through Bush, she had become over a period of eight years a senior administrator
                    in Peace Corps, area director in USIA, and an assistant administrator for Asia
                    in AID. So it was not as if she had no foreign affairs experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And especially, those particular organizations had
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Active programs in Nepal, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was serious stuff in Nepal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: And she was a serious person. So State was just the most recent of her
                    foreign affairs agencies, if you will. So those were the two ambassadors I
                    worked for there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Nepal at the time, in '89, was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I arrived in '88 and left in '91. The major event of that period, and
                    it was a protracted process, was the shift from direct royal autocracy to
                    democratically elected government. It did not happen easily, it did not happen
                    overnight but fortunately it happened with very little violence, in fact with
                    almost none and with the U.S. government and Ambassador Bloch in particular
                    playing a very helpful, very constructive role, very supportive role. This is
                    something we supported, at the same time, without the king being humiliated or
                    his role in Nepalese society being significantly undermined. So it was a very
                    careful balancing act. At the time it appeared to be a very successful
                    transition. Things have happened since then that have brought out the
                    weaknesses, especially among the democratic parties but also in the monarchy but
                    at the time it was a great accomplishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Sri Lanka, you served in India, you served
                        in Pakistan. How did you find the Nepalese people, the society with which
                        you were dealing. Was this a different breed of cat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was a different breed of cat in several ways. First and foremost,
                    Nepal has always been an independent country. It was never colonized. They're
                    very proud of that. It did not have the institutional infrastructure that, for
                    all of its shortcomings, for example in Pakistan, is still quite meaningful
                    which the British created in the other countries. That is in Bangladesh, in Sri
                    Lanka, in India, and in Pakistan, all areas which the British controlled. They
                    did not have that experience. The monarchy is also the same family who were the
                    creators of today's Nepal, having been in power for over 250 years, the same
                    ruling family. It is different also in that Nepal is a Himalayan country. That's
                    important because ethnically you have a mixture of Indian Hinduindeed, Hinduism
                    is the state religion - and Mongoloid groups in which there is also a
                    significant Buddhist element and a Tibetan element. Tibet has always been an
                    important neighbor for Nepal. There is also the Tibetan cultural influence and
                    Tibetan physical presence as well, through the refugees from Tibet. That Tibetan
                    Buddhism is very different from the Buddhism I encountered in Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>Nepal is very different too in that the army, maybe this is what makes it a
                    little closer to Pakistan, but the army always has played a traditionally
                    important role. The country is different also in that the social class that has
                    dominated Nepal for many generations is vary narrowly based and there is a big
                    gap between the Hindu castes and a very large percentage of the population who
                    are of Mongoloid, semi-Tibetan people. The famous Sherpas who lead people up
                    Mount Everest are from that background. Many of your so-called Gurkha soldiers
                    from Nepal are of that background also. The country is different, also, from the
                    others in that there's only one significant city and that's Kathmandu. So
                    Kathmandu dominates Nepal and always has dominated it since unification of Nepal
                    in the late 18th century. Nepal is also different in that, as their expression
                    puts it, they are between a rock and a hard place. Kathmandu is about five hours
                    by road from India and about four and a half to five hours by road from China.
                    So it's squeezed historically, culturally, linguistically. It's placed between
                    two enormous neighbors, China and India, and has to be very mindful of its
                    relations with both countries. So all of these factors add up to make it very
                    separate, very distinct from the other countries of the Subcontinent. And
                    finally and most obviously to Americans, it's very much a mountain dominated
                    country. The Himalayas are there, the world's highest mountains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who served in the Peace Corps there
                        and say, “You get out of Kathmandu and you take maybe a bus to someplace and
                        then you walk for three days.” In other words, an awful lot of villages are
                        out there which</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: And that points to another difference between Nepal and others, and
                    that's the infrastructure is woefully inadequate, especially roads,
                    communications, transportation, compared to the others.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just out of curiosity, I'm a military history buff. The
                        Gurkhas have always fascinated one. They have been, still are, I guess, a
                        part of the British Army. One, was this a term, I understand many of the men
                        would come back and retire there. And do they represent a class or group
                        apart or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The word Gurkha refers to one of the regions of Nepal and it's the
                    initial, core region of Nepal. The royal family, the current royal family, is
                    descended from the ruler of Gurkha, which is a district of Nepal. So it's from
                    that root that Nepalese soldiers have been known as Gurkhas. Now the British
                    came in contact with the Gurkhas in the early 19th century, when they were
                    fighting wars in northern India and were impressed by their martial qualities.
                    The actual fighting men, not necessarily the officers, are Himalayan tribal
                    people with very distinct Mongolian features. The officer class tends to be
                    Hindu. These other ethnic groups are known as the Gurungs, the Tamangs, there
                    are a number of them. The British maintained a “resident” or representative in
                    Kathmandu, where the Indian embassy and the British embassy are now co-located,
                    sharing that whole compound which the two governments divided in 1947. The
                    British had an agreement with the government of Nepal where they could recruit
                    Gurkha soldiers. And they maintained a recruiting base, which is still there in
                    Kathmandu. The British officers would go out into the hills, as you say, on
                    foot, and sign up young men. And often it became a family affair, but it tended
                    to be from these particular social and tribal groups, not from others in
                    Nepalese society. They're still recruited by the British Army and by the Indian
                    Army, far more significantly by the Indian Army which has several divisions made
                    up of Gurkhas. There were about 15 regiments in 1947 of the Indian Army that
                    were Gurkha soldiers at the end of World War II. And the British and Indian
                    governments divided them among themselves. The British kept two or three of them
                    and the Indians took the rest. To this day there are Gurkha regiments in both
                    armies. To this day, many of these people come back to Nepal, but increasingly
                    today when their enlistment expires from the British Army they are hired by
                    private security companies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. One of our colleagues, Tom Boyatt, I don't know if
                        you know Tom but he was the head of AFSA. He runs an outfit that hires
                        Gurkhas to protect banks and things like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I saw them in Saudi Arabia. They're well recruited for that, heavily
                    recruited. They're in Baghdad also, I mean in Iraq also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really talked about the situation in Nepal but we
                        haven't talked about the work of the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: We had a high profile and our presence in Nepal was extremely important
                    to the Nepalese as a symbol of our commitment to their independence and
                    sovereignty. . The neighboring presence of India and China is always a matter of
                    great immediacy to the Nepalese. There's a statement, I can't recall whether I
                    quoted it and I'm only paraphrasing it, but it's much more pithily stated by the
                    founder of the Nepalese kingdom, in which he said, “Nepal was like a piece of
                    bread sandwiched between two giant neighbors.” As I say, he put it much more
                    elegantly but you get the point. So our presence mattered a lot to them, as a
                    balance if nothing else. They welcomed the other embassies as well, of course,
                    but we were not just any outside power but the preeminent superpower. This was
                    in the terminal phase of the Soviet Union and so the Soviet presence, which was
                    never very important in any event in Nepal, was not of momentous concern to
                    them.</p>
                <p>We also had significant activities that we supported there. An aid program, an
                    AID mission that was large. We have a vibrant Peace Corps presence as well that
                    had a remarkable impact at the village level, where those volunteers were
                    stationed. So the commitment that the United States demonstrated through its
                    presence and programs, and through having an activist ambassador like Ambassador
                    Bloch, to the sovereignty and independence of Nepal was absolutely vital. I'll
                    get to how this became important in a practical sense, not just as an abstract
                    concept of international law. We had a very immediate access to the top
                    leadership of the Nepalese government. The Nepalese were very mindful of any
                    statements that we might make about them. Now, getting Washington's attention to
                    Nepal, of course, was another matter. That was never easy. Nepal's a very small
                    country, and so to get the attention of policy makers, not just for Nepal but
                    for any country of that stature or lack thereof, is a challenge. But having an
                    ambassador like Ambassador Bloch certainly helped, no question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us about how she operated. One of the
                        things being, this was a time when we weren't sending as many woman
                        ambassadors as we do now and in a traditional kingdom like that, how was
                        that? Firstly, how did sort of the gender thing work but also, how did she
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>THIUBAULT: Well, as I think I mentioned, she had had considerable Washington
                    experience, although she was a political appointee. Through the eight years of
                    the Reagan Administration she had been a senior official of USIA, of the Peace
                    Corps, and of AID. She was an assistant administrator for AID, for Asia, before
                    she came to Kathmandu. So she wasn't a babe in the woods and she had been on the
                    Hill as well, so she knew the congressional dimension to this. She knew how the
                    foreign policy system worked. More important, she had well-honed instincts and
                    acutely developed political antennae, unlike Ambassador Frank who, though a very
                    nice person, did not have that experience. All this proved invaluable at a time
                    of crisis. I think also that her personality, and just her character, were such
                    that she was not a person you could ignore. Gender was never an issue in terms
                    of access. In South Asia, I've never found that to be a major problem, including
                    in Pakistan, a Muslim country. It's another matter in the Middle East, perhaps,
                    but not in South Asia. So she very quickly established her credentials and as I
                    say was able to play an active role.</p>
                <p>At the same time, Nepal itself was undergoing great stress. Beginning in 1990,
                    the system there, the so-called Panchayat system, essentially of appointed
                    officials, that is appointed by the king, responsible to the king, came under
                    severe challenge from pro-democratic forces, led by the Nepali Congress, which
                    is a political party modeled on the Indian Congress, with which it had had ties
                    for many years. There were increasingly numerous and growing demonstrations
                    aimed at mobilizing public opinion around the idea of forcing the King to adopt
                    democratic concepts and institutions. These were events that were sometimes
                    marked by clashes with the police and rapidly spread around the country. They
                    attracted U.S. and international media attention via the Delhi-based bureau
                    chiefs who came to Kathmandu to report on them. The royal establishment, or the
                    Palace, as everyone called it, became very anxious to explain to us what its
                    approach was, sometimes voicing their suspicion that the Indian, through their
                    ties with the Nepali Congress, might be fomenting unrest. I should add that we
                    saw no evidence of the latter; there was every sign that these events were
                    strictly Nepalese in character.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>It was a defensively motivated dialogue, with the Nepalese anxious to make sure
                    that Washington understood their perspective. We saw the individuals and groups
                    who organized the agitation as legitimate democratic groups. We knew them well.
                    I often had Bhattarai and Koirala, NC party leaders who later became Prime
                    Ministers, to my house for breakfast before they got caught up in meeting with
                    their activists. At the same time, I had very close links with the King's senior
                    adviser and, indeed, sheltered him at home for a couple of nights as he hid from
                    mobs roaming his section of the city. These contacts gave the United States and
                    the ambassador in particular the opening to promote dialogue between the Palace
                    and the parties, to urge peaceful accommodation, which we then implemented, not
                    only in the form of public statements in which we encouraged the democratic
                    process; not only in terms of giving private advice to both sides, that is to
                    the Palace and to the political parties; but also in terms of providing
                    AID-sponsored, AID- funded programs that brought in American specialists on
                    constitution writing, for example, legal systems and the like. Now, this is
                    commonplace today, speaking in 2005 but I'm not sure it was quite as prevalent a
                    practice back then but we put it into place in Nepal, again led by the
                    Ambassador, who because of her command of the bureaucratic process, of AID's
                    package of programs and money that could be tapped, and of individuals in
                    Washington, could get a hearing on this and could certainly make a valid case.
                    So all of that helped define the approach that we followed.</p>
                <p>I should add, too, that just being in contact with leaders of the opposition was
                    a specific decision we had to make. In other words, as often is the case in
                    authoritarian systems, you had to consider the impact on the local establishment
                    of being in touch with individuals and maintaining a dialogue with individuals
                    who were dedicated to overthrowing that establishment. Now these were not
                    revolutionaries, as the current Marxist terrorist, almost terrorist, group is
                    that we read about in the papers occasionally when news of Nepal is reported.
                    Yesterday or two days ago they blew up a bus. Today I see in the Post they
                    issued an apology. Thirty five people were killed in the meantime. An honest
                    mistake! That stream of political thinking was very recessive at the time.</p>
                <p>Also, we had to consider the signal conveyed to the followers of these parties by
                    having the American ambassador or the deputy chief of mission, my job, meeting
                    with people who, in many cases, have been in jail for many, many years. The
                    Ambassador's meeting with Ganesh Man Singh, the grand old man of Nepalese
                    parties and leader of the Nepali Congress, who had been jailed by the king for
                    well over 20 years, was a major event. So this was a period of ferment for us.
                    Our objective was to encourage the process to be resolved, as I say with a
                    democratic outcome but in a peaceful manner and reflective of the democratic
                    values that these political groups claimed to espouse. And we worked overtime to
                    influence King Birendra and his entourage and the Royal Nepalese Army, which was
                    very loyal to the monarchy, to bend and to negotiate into being a new system
                    which would have room for them. And you know, it worked. The Nepalese themselves
                    deserved all of the credit, a positive commentary on their political values, but
                    we had reason to be proud of what we had done on the margins. Needless to say,
                    we had excellent relations with the new government that then took office in
                    1990.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>One of the striking features of Nepalese politics, I don't know about today but
                    certainly then, is that the established political parties, the Nepali Congress
                    in particular but even the Communists, were committed to maintaining the
                    monarchy. And the reason for this is that they saw the king as the symbol that
                    helped keep the country together and as a symbol of Nepalese identity and
                    distinctiveness with regard to India. That was very important to them. This was
                    the king, Birendra, who was assassinated by his own son several years ago, the
                    crown prince, in a terrible, terrible incident at the palace. Mother and father
                    and other family members were murdered, and finally the crown prince turned the
                    gun on himself. But Birendra, who was much shrewder than his brother, the
                    current monarch, the king was receptive to this approach and, again, we worked
                    hard to influence the thinking of the royal palace. Many of the advisors to the
                    king were sophisticated men who were widely traveled. Keep in mind that the
                    Nepali elite are all English speaking. Many of them, most of them, have been
                    educated in India, with some also in Britain, including Birendra, and some even
                    in the United States. So they reflected to a greater extent than one might
                    imagine a shared set of values, as well. But a key to their thinking was the
                    notion of maintaining Nepalese identity and independence because the great fear
                    of Nepal has been, presumably still is, and always will be, being swallowed up
                    by India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, as you were trying to promote this peaceful
                        transition to a democratic government, what was the role of the Indian
                        embassy or high commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It is the Indian embassy there; Nepal is not a member of the
                    Commonwealth, so it would be the Indian embassy. Actually they were very helpful
                    and we remained in close contact so that Delhi would have no misunderstanding of
                    our activities and objectives. We wanted thereby to make sure that the Indians
                    did not interpret our activities as aimed at undercutting them in their
                    backyard. India is a democratic country itself. They have always stated that
                    they recognize Nepal's independence. Their concern was with Chinese influence in
                    a country that they regard as within their sphere of influence and that is
                    important to their security in the Himalayas. So they watched the Chinese role
                    in Nepal closely and tried to offset it, particularly at that time. I don't know
                    if that's still the case. I assume to some extent it is. There was never any
                    suggestion that the Indians had designs on Nepalese independence and, as I say,
                    they themselves had extensive contacts throughout Nepalese society and politics.
                    It would have been astonishing if it had been otherwise, given how closely the
                    two countries are intertwined. I knew that. In fact, the Indian ambassador was
                    my former professor and research supervisor when I was a student in India, and
                    his officers were excellent people. So we worked closely together, along with
                    the British and others. So it wasn't that we were pitted against the Indians or
                    anyone else. We were all, in a sense, singing from the same sheet of music. No
                    one wanted to see instability and a breakdown of public order in Nepal. That
                    would be disastrous, not only for the Nepalese but for India itself. It would
                    create a vacuum for the Chinese and so forth. So I don't want to leave any
                    suggestion that we were at odds with the Indians. Quite the contrary.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The Chinese were, they were sort of like Banquo's ghost in Hamlet. In
                    other words, they played very little overt role, but everyone was wondering what
                    in fact it was. But again, the Chinese line was that they had no designs on
                    Nepali independence. They recognized Nepalese borders. Their concern was and had
                    been with the impact of Tibetan exiles and refugees, large numbers of whom lived
                    in Nepal, on what might be occurring in Tibet itself. So I think they tracked
                    that issue very closely. But we saw very little evidence, at least that I can
                    recall, of the Chinese in any way meddling or interfering in Nepalese internal
                    politics. But we did not have the contact and communication with them that we
                    did, as I say, with the Indians and with others. Still, I was invited regularly
                    to the Chinese Embassy for private dinners (wonderful food, I should add!) as
                    they sought to learn how much we knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Nepalese government doing about the Tibetan
                        refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The Tibetans had, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, I believe, fled to
                    India, having passed through Nepal. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of
                    Tibetans followed him over the years. Today there are very large Tibetan exile
                    communities in India and the Dalai Lama maintains his headquarters in
                    Dharamsala, in the Indian Himalayas, not far from the Nepalese border. The
                    Nepalese wanted the Tibetans to pass through freely, wanted the Tibetans to
                    leave as quickly as possible. Many of them did and some of them didn't. In the
                    Kathmandu valley there were several, there are a number of Tibetan temples and
                    communities there. Actually they have been quite helpful to Nepal's economy
                    because they really started what is now a major export, which is fine quality
                    hand-woven rugs that appeal very much to the interior design community. And we
                    would have periodic discussions, shall we say, with the Nepalese over incidents
                    that we would hear about in which Nepalese authorities turned Tibetans away at
                    the border or sent them back to Tibet into Chinese hands. And the human rights
                    community here in the United States and the pro-Tibetan lobby, which is very
                    large and very vocal and very influential in the United States and has been
                    since the Dalai Lama's exile, within hours would hear of these incidents in the
                    remote mountains. They would inform the State Department which would alert the
                    embassy and we, of course, would do our best to investigate these incidents. We
                    maintained a dialogue with the Nepalese on their approach to, and handling of,
                    Tibetans. Not only we Americans but others as well, especially the UNHCR (UN
                    High Commissioner for Refugees) office in Kathmandu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Nepalese government respond? You complain and
                        they say, “Okay, you take them!” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: They would say, “We don't know about these incidents and we'll
                    investigate them. They may have happened in remote areas and we haven't been
                    informed.” And that had some credibility, in the sense that Nepal is a country
                    with few roads and where communications are poorly developed. So that had some
                    plausibility. Mostly, I have to say, it was a positive treatment. There were
                    well known Tibetan handlers in Kathmandu and there was a well established bus
                    route to India. UNHCR had a presence, that is the UN High Commissioner for
                    Refugees, had a presence in Kathmandu and they would ensure the flow of refugees
                    once they got to Kathmandu. That was the question. Once they got to Kathmandu
                    they were in pretty good shape and they could move on to India pretty easily.
                    But at the border areas, which are mountainous and often snow covered and the
                    like and at a very high altitude, you never knew what was going on up there.
                    That said, relatively few were detained and turned over to the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy tasked with keeping an eye on developments
                        in Tibet? In other words, were you a listening post? You were the nearest
                        post to Tibet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, no, we never played that role. In fact, travel by Americans to
                    Tibet, even then, was relatively routine. You could take bus routes, you could
                    take a bus from Kathmandu to Lhasa. So it's not as if Tibet was sealed off.
                    Later on, must have been after I departed Nepal, they introduced air service
                    between the two towns. No, we were never tasked with monitoring Tibetan
                    developments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which would basically consist of debriefing</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, no, no, let me put it this way, no element of the mission had that
                    responsibility or tasking and I would have known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what about errant Americas of one stripe or
                        another?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Just as a note, I don't want to let my discussion of the Indians pass
                    without reference to a major problem that did develop, which illustrated the
                    concerns that the Nepalese had, and again the interplay of Chinese and Indians.
                    In order to demonstrate their independence, if you will, from the Indians and
                    just their general independence, the Nepalese contracted to buy small arms from
                    China during the time that I was there. This must have been in early '89 because
                    Ambassador Frank was still there. Remember, before Ambassador Bloch, who arrived
                    in 1989, there was Ambassador Milton Frank for a year, in the last year of the
                    Reagan Administration. So they bought small arms from the Chinese. This greatly
                    upset the Indians, who as I say watched the Sino-Nepalese relationship extremely
                    closely. I got, from my counterpart in the Indian embassy, advance notice that
                    the Indians would not stand by and let this pass and that Rajiv Gandhi, who was
                    then the Indian prime minister, was personally engaged with this issue and
                    acting under the advice of some of his advisors who advocated a kind of
                    blockade. They wanted to bring home to the Nepalese that they had crossed the
                    red line, if you will. So I reported this to Washington, but neither they nor
                    our embassy in Delhi took it seriously. But within a matter of two or three
                    weeks, the Indians imposed a fuel blockade on Nepal. And the importance of this
                    to the Nepalese economy is explained by the fact that they are very dependent on
                    the port of Calcutta. They are a landlocked country and they depend on the port
                    of Calcutta and their well- established shipping routes for their imports,
                    including oil products, from Indian refineries primarily. And the Indians cut
                    that off which within a very short period of time brought the Nepalese economy
                    to its feet. In the embassy, for example, we all rode around on bikes. The
                    ambassador used his car, an armored car, minimally. Fortunately, Kathmandu was a
                    relatively small place, so you could get around on foot or on bike more easily
                    than you might in some other places.</p>
                <p>But it was a major development and contrary to international law, which
                    guarantees the rights of landlocked countries. Even in the worst times, when I
                    was stationed in Pakistan, of Pak-Afghan relations, when the Soviets and their
                    puppets were running the country and there were many suggestions to the
                    Pakistanis that they put the squeeze on Afghan imports passing through the port
                    of Karachi, they refused to do so, citing these provisions of international law.
                    Now there were payoffs involved so I won't go into that, there are always wheels
                    within wheels. So this was clearly illegal on the Indians' part, but yet that's
                    how they acted, that's how they responded. And eventually, it was quietly lifted
                    after a few weeks. But the Nepalese had gotten the point and there were no
                    further arms purchases from the Chinese. So there was a very real basis for
                    Nepalese fears about protecting the substance of their independence and
                    sovereignty under Indian pressure, actual or potential.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Now you were asking about errant Americans. This was a constant concern. The
                    consular section, in size, is probably no larger than any other section in a
                    post of equivalent size but it certainly had unique challenges. Previously, that
                    is in the Seventies, Nepal was known for the hippie tourist trade and easy
                    access to drugs and the like, which drew a very, let's put it this way,
                    interesting mixture of people but didn't generate much income for the country
                    while at the same time generating a lot of notoriety. The Nepalese government in
                    the early Eighties really began to clean up its act, kick these people out,
                    prevent them from coming in and began to encourage, very strongly, nature and
                    adventure tourism and they were very successful at this. They had a major new
                    airport, which the Japanese had built, and the Airbuses would come in from
                    Japan, Europe and from the United States, bringing well heeled would-be
                    adventurers who were there to explore the Himalayas and in many cases do some
                    mountain climbing. It was a major source of income and of employment. There were
                    many trekking agencies in Kathmandu and they were very generous with work
                    permits and residence permits for foreigners in Kathmandu. So there was always,
                    as part of this, a free-floating community, if you will. There were always a
                    certain number of Americans, a lot of them from the West Coast. So this was a
                    large part of our consular clientele.</p>
                <p>What would often happen is that people would come in having perhaps two weeks or
                    three weeks maximum to spend in the country and would immediately set out to
                    climb in the Himalayas which are spectacularly beautiful. I've never seen a
                    country as gorgeous as Nepal, from that perspective. And as I mentioned you had
                    a very well developed infrastructure of guides and Sherpas, human caravans who
                    would carry everything with and for you, at every price range. People poured in
                    to do this trekking. Most of them had a great time and left safely and there was
                    no problem. But there were a number who were not as successful. So word would
                    come to us that they had run into trouble and we would have to try to do our
                    best, first of all, to find out what had happened and to mobilize support for
                    them, in many cases. These also included people who had died while they were
                    engaged in climbing, often of mountain sickness, which if I understand it
                    correctly results from climbing high altitudes too quickly without a period of
                    adaptation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost like the reverse of the bends?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, that's exactly it. It affects you in the cranial area. People
                    would come having climbed in the Rockies or in South America and feel that they
                    were experienced climbers. But there's a world of difference between climbing at
                    the 12 to 14 or 15,000 foot level and climbing at the 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and
                    23,000 foot level. Having only a relatively short amount of time, they would
                    push the envelope. Mountain sickness can strike you regardless of physical
                    condition, regardless of age, regardless of gender. It's totally egalitarian, if
                    you will. Not everyone is affected, most are not. But many are. And the only
                    answer to it, and it's a very effective one, is to descend very rapidly. And it
                    usually hits you at the 12 to 14,000 foot range. One of its hallmarks is to
                    become disoriented. So others will see you reflecting the symptoms of it, which
                    include confusion and irrationality and you can't be talked into doing what is
                    the right thing. You don't recognize it. So we had a number of people who would
                    die there and the embassy would try to make sure that, among other things, the
                    remains could be shipped home.</p>
                <p>We were perhaps the only embassy in the world, at least that I'm aware of, that
                    had a little morgue of its own. We had, in the Recreation Association area, we
                    had a refrigerating unit with these coroner's shelves and you could stack people
                    up. Of course, Americans were not the only victims of this and so you would get
                    pleas from your colleagues at other missions, we have a Brit or Japanese or
                    Norwegian or whatever and could you help store him there. Sometimes the units
                    would be empty and you'd say, “Sure!” and then two days later an American would
                    arrive and be stacked. I don't want to sound ghoulish about it but this is one
                    of the realities. The other thing is that there were no embalming facilities
                    because in Nepal, Hindu culture, you cremate within 24 hours. So there was a
                    professor of anatomy in the medical school in Kathmandu who had been sent for
                    technical training, not in his field, by one of the European countries, but in
                    embalming techniques. That must have been a rather unique aid program, so that
                    he could be called on if appropriate.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The most dramatic instance that I recall was getting word that a young American
                    of Asian descent from San Francisco had died. He was only 21. Of course, one of
                    the most distressing responsibilities of a consular officer anywhere is to
                    inform a family in the event of death of an American citizen. So our consul
                    called to tell them that he had received this news. Of course, the parents were
                    heartbroken, this was their only child, but they very much wanted to have his
                    remains sent home. Our consular officer, Charles Parrish, said he'd see what he
                    could do. He and other consular officers would go out, sometimes for two to
                    three weeks at a time, trekking in the Himalayas, to be in touch with police
                    officials, with medical people, with the trekking companies, with the rest
                    houses, the guesthouses, the restaurants and so forth that sort of populated the
                    trail. Charles, a former Marine, set out with his FSN. He said, “I'm going in
                    that area, I've got a trip scheduled. Let me see what I can do.” He had been
                    told that the body of the young man had been buried under rocks along the trail
                    so as to protect the remains against animals who might prey on them. So he had
                    an idea of where the body was. It was about 13 to 14,000 feet high altitude. He
                    went to the nearest source of kerosene, bought a can of kerosene which he put on
                    his back and carried up to the site where the young man's remains had been
                    buried. And he uncovered them and cremated the body there; this was in a driving
                    snowstorm, he told me later. When they had been cremated thoroughly he gathered
                    up the ashes, he had a receptacle for those and brought them down again and was
                    able to send them to the young man's family and of course they were very
                    grateful for that. I remember writing this up in Charles' EER, reflecting the
                    spirit of the consular section; he was the section head in Nepal.</p>
                <p>But we had many accounts. A bus would fall off the trail and passengers would be
                    killed and would include some Americans and their bodies would be retrieved,
                    carried back to Kathmandu for storage in that refrigerated unit. So it was a
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>Unlike some other countries, where you were constantly dealing with largish
                    numbers of visa seekers, young men, most of whom you had to be doubtful of their
                    intention to return to their country, we had relatively few Nepalese visa
                    seekers of that type, other than the normal flow of students and business
                    people, government officials, people with families and so forth. And very few,
                    virtually no, Nepalese overstayed their visas. So that was a pleasant change for
                    me, having been in Lahore, in Pakistan, where we were flooded with dubious visa
                    applicants. So American citizen services was really the core of the consular
                    section's work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were two major international events that happened
                        during your time. One was the fall of the Berlin Wall and all the
                        satellites, the changes there. The other one was the Gulf War. Did either of
                        those play much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I have to say that the fall of the Berlin Wall did not have much local
                    effect, except, of course, for the German embassy, because the East Germans had
                    a mission there as well, and it put the Communist Party, and the communists had
                    always been a strong factor in Nepalese politics, put them on the defensive.
                    Other than that, no, I would not say that the changes in Europe in a place as
                    distant as Nepal with its own concerns, and a tremendously inward-looking focus
                    on their own domestic upheavals, that that was really a major event for them, at
                    least as I recall.</p>
                <p>So far as the Gulf War was concerned, we went into overdrive, that is the mission
                    did, in making sure that we explained to Nepalese public opinion the background
                    and the response by the United States, leading the international community, to
                    Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait. As you can imagine, there was no sympathy
                    for Saddam and Iraq in a country like Nepal, which saw itself like Kuwait in the
                    shadow of much larger neighbors. And the Muslim population there is miniscule,
                    so that there wasn't an Islamic dimension to this. And then, of course, the
                    British contingent included Gurkhas. The British maintain an active recruiting
                    center in Kathmandu and ties between the Royal Nepalese Army and the British
                    Army go back generations. So it was a very positive understanding , abetted by
                    the support extended by the whole international community and the United
                    Nations. There were no points of contention there over the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the embassy, what, obviously you're a Subcontinent
                        hand, the Indian embassy, what were you getting from them on the Gulf
                        War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I really, I find that a hard question to answer. My recollection is
                    that the Indian position was not critical of the United States. We had some
                    overflight issues and there were some elements in the Indian political
                    environment who were critical. But I don't recall that these really intruded
                    much into how the Indians conducted themselves in Nepal on this issue. It didn't
                    register with me at the time, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much contact with the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: We were on friendly terms, we were on friendly terms. Tiananmen Square
                    occurred during this period, June of '89, so for a time there was a lack of
                    communication and contact with them. But we really didn't, I can't say that we
                    really spent much time with them, but it wasn't a hostile relationship. I've
                    already noted my encounters with the Chinese embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that involved you or the
                        ambassador or the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: None that come to mind, beyond the ones you always have in managing
                    programs and the like. But in terms of the type that we've talked about here,
                    no, I can't think of any.\</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the programs, between AID and what the
                        embassy, sort of the State Department side of the embassy work, were they
                        well coordinated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They occupied, the AID mission occupied, a building, a large building
                    across town, so it wasn't that they were on the same compound as we, but for
                    that matter this was also the case with USIS which had its own office as did the
                    Peace Corps. So we were scattered around, even the medical unit was elsewhere.
                    But at the same time, I would say that there was excellent coordination. The
                    ambassador, having been an assistant AID administrator, obviously had a terrific
                    grasp of AID programs, not only as an AID administrator, but as AID
                    administrator for Asia as a whole. So she knew the AID side very, very well. She
                    handpicked the director, Kelly Kammerer. Both he and his deputy, Stacey Rhodes,
                    and I were all on very positive terms, so there was no friction and the AID
                    mission was very responsive in shifting to new priorities in response to the
                    political situation. So I would say that AID was a key element of the
                    ambassador's strategy and of intra-mission cooperation. The same was also true
                    of Peace Corps which had a very large program. Very good interpersonal
                    relationships among myself, the Ambassador, and agency reps also helped
                    considerably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right now there's a very nasty Marxist movement going on
                        in Nepal. Was that around at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Only in the portions of Nepal that bordered on the state of West Bengal
                    in India. Now West Bengal was and is the center of the communist movement in
                    India. There's no question that in its more virulent phases Maoism had a certain
                    appeal in Bengal and the Communist Party there split, as it did in many parts of
                    the world, between the pro-Soviet and the pro-Chinese Marxists. The pro-Chinese
                    Marxists had a following in the border areas adjacent to, as I say, West Bengal.
                    It was probably a precursor of what we've seen subsequently but landlords were
                    targeted. Some of them were beheaded. Others were just gunned down. But these
                    were very distant echoes and you would hear about them or you heard about
                    incidents like these that had happened even before my arrival. But the main
                    communist group was a much more tame movement which had strong ties with, if you
                    will, the establishment Communist Parties in India and they were distracted for
                    a long time by the collapse in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union itself. So
                    they were really on the fringes at that point, although some of their leaders
                    were politicians of substantial stature in Nepal. But, as I say, this was still
                    a very small cloud on the horizon and at the time no one would have guessed that
                    it would evolve to where we are now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1991, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In 1991, after 12 years abroad, I returned to Washington and I became
                    director of the Office for Europe, Near East, South Asia and Latin America,
                    quite a mouthful, in what was then called the Directorate (not Bureau) for
                    Refugee Programs (RP). I was an FS-1. It was one of the few office director
                    positions open to a One level officer. The main reason I think I was selected
                    for that was because of my experience in Pakistan, where we, of course, were
                    very well aware of the huge numbers of Afghan refugees who had come into
                    Pakistan. At that time, the Pakistani refugee caseload, if you will, was the
                    largest challenge and the largest call on RP resources. So they wanted someone
                    who had some acquaintance with those issues. I recall making a trip to Pakistan
                    at that time, visiting camps and meeting with the folks who dealt with refugee
                    issues in Islamabad and Peshawar, Quetta and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '91 to ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was there from '91 to '93. It was located, not in Main State, but
                    right across the street, at Columbia Plaza. The first director whom I worked for
                    was Ambassador Princeton Lyman, followed by the late Ambassador Warren
                    Zimmerman, both of them tremendous officers and great leaders. I have great
                    respect for both of them. And then some great deputies, as well. Sarah Moten,
                    with whom I worked very closely, was a political appointee, and then Brunson
                    McKinley, who's now head of the OIM, the Organization of International Migration
                    in Geneva, a UN body, and Priscilla Clapp. Brunson's a Foreign Service officer,
                    who had been ambassador to Haiti and Priscilla Clapp had been DCM in Pretoria, I
                    believe. Anyway, it was a great team and my colleagues in RP were first rate, as
                    well. I look back on that experience with great fondness. Let me just say a word
                    about RP because it was made up primarily of civil service folks who were mostly
                    women and that combination, particularly the predominance of women, gave a
                    different feel and different tone to the workings of the office, to the
                    decision-making process. And I say this in the most positive way possible. There
                    were several FSO's but as I say, it was predominately, I would say
                    overwhelmingly, a civil service workforce in RP. The attraction for me to work
                    there, in addition to the nature of the work, was also the management
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p>My office which was, as I mentioned, Europe, Near East, South Asia and Latin
                    America, had the budget, believe it or not, of $350 million dollars. RP's budget
                    is separate from that of the State Department. At that time, it totaled $700 to
                    $800 million, a separate Congressional appropriation. We had to make our own
                    case to the Congress for the resources that we needed. It is a bureau that works
                    very closely with NGO's and with a whole host of organizations in the United
                    States who support refugees and particularly support the resettlement of
                    refugees. A number of them are church and religious groups, generally speaking.
                    So it was a very different kind of experience for me and one that was extremely
                    helpful, I think, in expanding my awareness of how government works.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>I went in, as I mentioned, thinking that my focus would be on Afghan refugee
                    issues and that always did remain a large part of my clientele, if you will. But
                    the Gulf War, as you mentioned, had occurred just before I transferred. I left
                    Nepal and then that summer I moved to Washington and began working in RP. And
                    you may recall that in the wake of the Gulf War, there was a tremendous outflow
                    of Kurds from northern Iraq into Turkey. I mean they just picked up and moved
                    into Turkey and that was a major source of humanitarian concern and
                    international attention and of focus by the United States government. RP is the
                    bureau that is on the cutting edge of response to any humanitarian crisis and of
                    course we have an unending supply of these. In part, not only is this so because
                    of its mandate but also because it has its own budget and also it has its very
                    well developed network of relationships with counterpart organizations at the
                    national level, at the UN and international level, and at the domestic level.
                    These are underpinned by the personal ties and continuity provided by civil
                    service personnel who had managed their “accounts” for many years. And you can
                    be very creative in moving funds and when I say creative, I say this in a
                    positive way in responding quickly.</p>
                <p>And so it's a great blessing for the Department that RP has its own budget,
                    because there are few other pots of money to tap. I notice the President just
                    announced yesterday that he would be increasing the U.S. commitment to Africa
                    and this would be another $650 million, if I read the article correctly. Where
                    is that money going to come from? The Congress hasn't appropriated it yet, to my
                    knowledge. Well, some of it will probably come out of RP and some of it is a
                    question of the labels you apply to existing programs or the reshuffling or
                    reallocation of priorities and resources. We had a decision making process
                    within RP which met every week, all of us, chaired by the Director of RP, in
                    which we went over each program - program by program - and it was a funding
                    allocation process. We could be very nimble. It's a bureau which does not
                    attract the attention, and particularly the recognition, it really deserves.
                    When you have leaders of the caliber of Ambassador Lyman and Ambassador
                    Zimmerman, men of great integrity and great experience and widely recognized as
                    such, they could just cut through all kinds of problems. Of course, having these
                    resources meant the top level of the Department would often turn to them, too.
                    So it was a source of unhappiness that RP at that time was not recognized as a
                    separate Bureau. The head was known as the director of RP as opposed to an
                    assistant secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RP stood for...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Refugee Programs. This changed shortly after I left and it was elevated
                    to bureau status, which it now has, of course, but somewhat expanded. It is now
                    known as Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM.) There was a concern then
                    that by adding population and migration, the emphasis on refugees, the core
                    function, would get lost or diluted, and that perhaps some of the funding would
                    go to other purposes, but I don't know what the facts are on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned having civil servants, mainly women, gave an
                        added boost. Give a little feel for why.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: There was an empathy for the refugee populations, which is very
                    important. Also, as I said earlier, we worked very closely with NGO's and with a
                    whole spectrum - you have no idea, I had no idea - of the groups out there in
                    our own society, and I'm not talking about the international community, who are
                    engaged in this humanitarian enterprise, if I may call it that very broadly.
                    Many of them, many, many, many of them, are staffed and led by women also. Way
                    out of proportion to what you might encounter, elsewhere, in other
                    organizations. I don't want to fall into stereotypes. They could communicate at
                    a level of mutual knowledge that arose from so knowing each other so well and
                    for so long. Having civil service people was very important because that
                    continuity was of critical importance. I can't let this session pass without
                    mentioning my own deputy, Judy Chavchavadze, who died several years ago, who had
                    been in RP for many years and was just a delightful person and an extremely
                    competent person. The two of us worked very, very closely together. It was a
                    great experience to be in that office. We started off, very shortly after I
                    arrived, dealing with this Kurdish exodus issue. In connection with that, I
                    accompanied the deputy RP director, Sarah Moten, on a trip to Turkey, to
                    northern Iraq, then to Israel and Jordan, because we dealt with the Palestinians
                    whom we were supporting, even going on to Saudi Arabia. So it was a new
                    experience for me to travel to the Middle East which I didn't know at that time.
                    And subsequently I made a number of trips to Geneva, to New York, to Rome and
                    Paris and so forth, dealing with counterparts on these issues, traveling with
                    Warren Zimmerman and others.</p>
                <p>The Kurdish issue, one way or another, was resolved fairly quickly. Within a
                    matter of four or five months most of the Kurds, who of course didn't receive a
                    very warm welcome in Turkey, returned to northern Iraq once it was clear that
                    the northern part of Iraq would be a zone protected by the United States. And if
                    you recall then subsequently it really became quite independent of the rest of
                    Iraq and we're living with the consequences of that today.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The major issue that then developed and which consumed a great portion of my
                    attention was Bosnia in spring and summer 1992. As Yugoslavia collapsed we had
                    the emergence of these new republics and, particularly in Bosnia, after it had
                    declared independence, the murderous confrontations among the Croats, the Serbs
                    and the Muslims, the Bosnian Muslims, Bosniacs, as they're called. The Bush
                    administration's policy, such as it was, was not to intervene in any kind of
                    forceful way but to sort of sit on the sidelines, wringing their hands and
                    calling on all parties to behave properly. Absent a political, i.e. military,
                    response, the real nub of US policy toward Bosnia was to fashion a humanitarian
                    response and this is where RP played a key role, for the reasons that I've
                    mentioned. It allowed the Bush and very soon thereafter the Clinton
                    Administration to project itself as responding to the displacement and the
                    devastation and the suffering and the killings that were being widely reported
                    in the media by pointing to the money that we were spending to assist refugees.
                    And again, RP was the source of those funds. Beginning in '92 we had an
                    interagency coordination process, led by the NSC and would have videoconferences
                    every day or every other day, as well as meetings with Under Secretary Kantor,
                    who was under secretary for political affairs, virtually every day in his
                    office. Bosnia was an all-consuming issue for the Department and for the
                    administration and we were thrust right in the middle of this. And of course
                    because what had until that time been an appendage for my particular office,
                    which I'll mention again was Europe, Near East, South Asia and Latin America,
                    Europe suddenly for the first time in forty years became of significance in the
                    RP context. I wasn't the point man on this because the Director became so, but I
                    was certainly heavily engaged in the policy process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during a change in administrations, '91 to
                        '93, the Clinton Administration came in '93. Was there a change in looking
                        at the Bosnian tragedy, it wasn't just Bosnia at that time, it was Croatia,
                        crises, between the two administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: There was little to differentiate the Bush Administration's handling of
                    Yugoslavia and the republics from Clinton's. Events in Bosnia gathered momentum
                    after the elections. The focus certainly was there in the Clinton Administration
                    but the policy of non-involvement was maintained. The coordinator for this
                    interagency process was Nancy Soderberg, who then became an ambassador under
                    Clinton to the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on both, there was this tremendous aversion to
                        direct intervention.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Aversion to taking any kind of military action. Both Secretaries Baker
                    and Christopher shared that view, strongly backed by the Pentagon. No one wanted
                    to be sucked in to any commitment of U.S. military forces in the Balkans. The
                    same was very true of the Europeans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what were you doing in the Bosnia thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I should mention that I made several trips to Croatia and into Bosnia,
                    as well, to see for myself, to meet with our partners, and to document how our
                    resources were being used. We don't send our own State Department people out
                    there to directly provide assistance but we provide funding for organizations
                    that do deliver humanitarian aid. To UN agencies and to experienced NGO's as
                    well. Again, RP's job is not to send people over there. You might have a refugee
                    coordinator. For example, in Islamabad where we had a refugee program of long
                    standing, we had an officer who devoted himself or herself exclusively to
                    refugees and to managing the refugee support programs. Our RP job was primarily
                    to translate a U.S. policy decision into funding support, and to allocate that
                    funding to whoever is going to deliver the assistance, and finally to monitor
                    their performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about your, not really evaluation but
                        your feelings about effectiveness, the ease of dealing with, the problems
                        with, some of the major groups that dealt, like the UN and some
                        non-governmental organizations, I think of Doctors Without Borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, there are a number of them; Catholic Relief Service is another. I
                    say flat out that they do a terrific job. I don't think most Americans fully
                    appreciate the difficulties in the field and often the dangers that they face
                    there as well. The logistical challenges that exist as well are often
                    formidable. I really can't single out any as being less effective than others. I
                    did not encounter that myself. My recollection is that they were operating under
                    incredible difficulties in doing a job without having political tools with which
                    to ameliorate the situation they were dealing with. In Bosnia, in particular,
                    unlike some other refugee situations, the problem wasn't so much hunger or
                    distress or lack of clothing or housing, it was the physical danger which
                    vulnerable populations were facing. There's a very great limit on what these
                    organizations can do to deal with that as we see daily in Iraq. They can only
                    move into the limited openings that the participants in the fighting, if you
                    will, the combatants, will permit them and maybe to create a space that will be
                    respected by these combatants and then be able to reach populations. It's very
                    easy to point a finger at them but, in my experience, they tend to be people of
                    great experience, great commitment and imaginative in how they do their jobs. I
                    have great respect for them.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, the Srebrenica tragedy began to unfold when I was in RP. But there
                    were less-publicized but well-known camps, mass murders, ethnic targeting. We
                    had that information. The frustrating part of it was that reporting from the
                    media, from intelligence sources, from other governments, from our own missions,
                    was very comprehensive in describing what was happening, particularly to the
                    Bosnian Muslims. And as I say, the administration was very reluctant to come to
                    any kind of military assistance. Fortunately, under public pressure, this policy
                    began to erode. I recall traveling to our air base in Germany, near Dusseldorf
                    in early '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frankfurt-Wiesbaden, maybe Dusseldorf.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was a major air base in Germany. The Clinton administration was
                    under tremendous pressure from public opinion and from the media and from the
                    Congress here to respond more forcefully. Particularly to deliver foodstuffs to
                    Bosnian Muslims who were surrounded by Serbs near Srebrenica. This was one area
                    where providing foodstuffs and medical supplies and relief was a matter of life
                    and death for these people. So rather than attempting any kind of land operation
                    they decided to have an airdrop and use MREs, to deliver MREs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meals Ready to Eat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Meals Ready to Eat, that's right. And I recall the NATO commander for
                    southern Europe, based in Naples, whose name escapes me at the moment, I think
                    he died shortly thereafter, flew up for the meeting with the planners, the intel
                    folks, and the pilots. It was the last planning session for the first airdrops
                    that were to begin that night. So I was, with a couple of colleagues, in the
                    mission coordination center at the air base. And the guidelines for the pilots,
                    all of whom were gathered there, were very explicit, that they were not to
                    descend below 35,000 feet, so they would be out of reach of any kind of ground
                    response from the Serbs. And the hope was that the parachutes, a sufficient
                    number of them, would land in the right places. As it turned out, this was
                    relatively effective. Most of them did land and reach the people they were
                    supposed to reach. But over the long term it didn't make much difference as many
                    of these people, especially the men, were rounded up and then shot by the Serbs,
                    in spite of the presence of a Dutch battalion nearby which had been inserted
                    there. So you could see this sort of creeping military response but just at the
                    initial stages there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting, within the State Department, looking at
                        this thing, were signs of, I won't say rebellion, but discontent? Warren
                        Zimmerman, for example, was an old Yugoslav hand. He and I served together
                        in Yugoslavia way back in the Sixties.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: He was, Warren was very critical of, I mean privately, of this
                    approach. Many of us were very frustrated by it and I recall perhaps one or two
                    resignations but on our side, we believed strongly in what RP was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there were three or something and these were
                        people on the desk who'd been reading the reports. How about with the Middle
                        East? What we were doing for the Palestinians, did sort of almost domestic
                        American politics creep in there in that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The issue there was less domestic politics and more to do with the
                    effectiveness of UNWRA (United Nations Works and Relief Administration) in
                    supporting the Palestinians. I haven't thought about this in a long time but the
                    UN... I say UN, it's administered by the UN but is supported by the
                    international community, largely led by the US, the major donor then, which
                    provided the funding that paid the salaries of the Palestinian administration,
                    particularly for social services, including schools and medical clinics and the
                    like. It was always a question of whether the funding commitments would be
                    adequate to meet the needs. So aid for the Palestinians tended to be more a
                    bureaucratic issue than one reflecting domestic political cross-currents. I
                    think there was broad support for this program, as a means of keeping the
                    Palestinians quiet, or phrased otherwise but also accurately, to indicate that
                    our policy was not 100 percent unquestioned support of Israel. Cynicism aside,
                    our funding and that of others made a huge difference to helpless people. And
                    our travel was important. We could be a lot more persuasive if we had seen for
                    ourselves what was being done with U.S. funding and then argue against cutbacks
                    or budget freezes.</p>
                <p>But nonetheless when you had conflicting demands on your budget and you needed to
                    be responsive, you could make shifts pretty quickly, to ramp up to meet Bosnia,
                    for example, though realizing that without a new appropriation often meant
                    robbing Peter to pay Paul. I mean, where does the “new” money that the Secretary
                    wants in a crisis situation come from? So you'd look at your existing pots of
                    money. UNWRA might be vulnerable in that regard because it was a longstanding
                    program; so were the Afghan programs. They had been in place a long time. Plans
                    made to increase UNWRA's funding to reflect rising caseloads and costs might be
                    shelved, with such funds being allocated to Bosnians or to Iraqi refugees in
                    Saudi Arabia, including the establishment of new camps for them.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>This bureaucratic process extended to the other dimension of RP's mandate beyond
                    refugee assistance which was refugee resettlement. RP's total $750 million
                    budget included a very large amount for settlement in the U.S. of, notably,
                    Vietnamese and some Cambodians. We were winding up the last of the Vietnamese
                    refugees in places like Thailand and the Philippines and settling them in the
                    United States. Not to mention Soviet Jews, Pentecostals, and other groups for
                    whom there were specific quotas within the Congressional annual quota of, say
                    125,000 refugees entering the U.S. But you might have fewer Soviet Jews come in
                    because of the collapse of the USSR; you might have fewer Vietnamese than
                    anticipated, so that would open numbers to be allocated to other groups, along
                    with funding to accompany the adjustment. You would have to consult with the
                    committees over in Congress to do so. And then you would work with the
                    resettlement agencies in the United States, many of which were religious in
                    nature, who placed refugees in specific American communities and paid the costs
                    associated with their move plus funding for housing and temporary support. That
                    was a whole other dimension of RP that I was not involved in but was very aware
                    of because all of us were so intertwined. I was in refugee assistance. That was
                    refugee resettlement. Those were separate budgets within RP. As I say, beyond
                    the high politics of the tragedies that created refugees, there was a lot of
                    bureaucratic churning on these issues. That is what running a program, managing
                    resources adds up to in contrast to the strictly policy offices who seemed to
                    assume we could roll over and do their bidding. But that is how we would be
                    brought into the inter-agency policy process. Believe me, it was a learning
                    experience which made me appreciate the work of AID and others. Bringing money
                    to the table makes you very attractive, I quickly learned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The ones that we dealt with were primarily Guatemalan refugees who were
                    in southern Mexico. One of my officers went down there and visited their camps.
                    There were a handful of others in Latin America, but that region was by far the
                    smallest element in my portfolio.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the relations, your bureau, sort of existing off
                        there, were there much ties to the geographic bureaus or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, of course you dealt with them, what I just called the policy
                    offices, depending on the refugee issue in question. With Bosnia, it was EUR
                    which played a prominent role in the Bosnian Working Group chaired by the NSC.
                    I've also mentioned how Under Secretary Kantor chaired daily meetings on Bosnia
                    in his office, where various bureaus were represented. IO, for example, was
                    always a major player there because the Administration sought to thrust the UN
                    into a leadership role. Often you would have POL-MIL, political military,
                    because of the military dimension. INR would present the latest intelligence
                    update. You would have the admin people because some of their assets, some of
                    their equities, might be involved. So it was definitely a broad, inclusive
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever find in these meetings that, let's say on
                        Bosnia, that RP, their office director was pushing to do more and the
                        representation from the European bureau would say, “We have to go
                        slow?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No. We had very close relations with EUR especially and with the others
                    as well. As I say, you worked with these people fulltime, particularly with the
                    EUR people. And again, we were at the working level, not at the policy making
                    level. We were there to make sure that the programs that we, RP, were funding
                    were working properly. Our role was important to them because for a very long
                    time, the UNHCR and NGO's were all that we, the U.S., had going to address an
                    unfolding tragedy that had caught the world's attention and that of the American
                    public. We did not really get into these larger policy issues. Warren Zimmerman
                    might be there on that. In addition to the meetings, you were on the phone with
                    them, by e-mail and fax and all of that, throughout the day. So there was no gap
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in '93. How did you feel? I would think you would
                        be somewhat disheartened about seeing what was happening in Bosnia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Particularly since you shift gears so abruptly. This is the nature of
                    the assignment process for the Foreign Service, unlike the civil service. You
                    work literally up to midnight of one day. Then you're out of it and someone else
                    steps in and you immediately move on to something quite different. So there's a
                    frustration there in not seeing a process or a decision through. There's no
                    denying that I felt an anger that nothing more was being done. It was especially
                    disheartening because the information on the Serbian atrocities was so clear,
                    with visions of the Holocaust hanging over the reports of systematic ethnic
                    cleansing in Bosnia, and yet the international community refused to act. The
                    Europeans should be held more accountable than ourselves; after all, it was
                    their region and their shared history. As I stated, I traveled to Bosnia, came
                    under shell fire in Mostar as the Serbs on the surrounding hills sought to drive
                    out the remaining Croats and Muslims, saw the public parks there full of Muslim
                    graves, and heard first-hand accounts from victims of the Serbs. In that
                    particular case you could see, as I mentioned with the example of the airdrops,
                    you could see the administration beginning to change its approach, but it was
                    agonizingly slow, as they began to bend to public pressure rather than acting on
                    the basis of some reasoned policy change within the USG. Let me mention here, in
                    this regard, that where you really felt the existing policy digging in, even at
                    the working level, was on the DOD side particularly at the other daily meeting
                    which was convened by videoconference and chaired by the NSC where you would
                    have DOD, CIA, AID and others participating as well as State.</p>
                <p>From RP I went to the United Nations in New York. I was the senior advisor for
                    South Asia at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The South Asia bureau had
                    just been created, broken off from NEA. Other bureaus had their own senior
                    representatives or advisors as they were called. So I was selected for this. It
                    was a three to four month experience between the beginning of September '93,
                    let's say Labor Day, and the end of December, around Christmas. From there in
                    January 1994, I went to the Board of Examiners for about six months, a most
                    interesting experience. And from there, in August, I went into Arabic language
                    training for a year at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center and then in
                    the summer of '95 I went to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as political counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Al, let's start with the first one of your
                        assignments.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Let me just correct, at the very outset, correct the title that I had
                    for that brief period at the UN, which was not special representative but senior
                    advisor. And as I mentioned there, I was one of several, each representing a
                    different bureau in the Department. As the Bureau of South Asian Affairs had
                    recently been formed, having been hived off from NEA, something which I
                    parenthetically will say I highly applauded, the bureau decided it should also
                    have a senior advisor there. I believe that there has been one there ever since.
                    It's always during the General Assembly session in the fall. For those who have
                    not had any experience at the UN, it's a marvelous experience and an opportunity
                    to learn better the work of the United Nations, of the committees and of course
                    to see U.S. policy at work there. To be candid, my responsibilities were not
                    particularly onerous because the number of countries in the South Asia bureau is
                    six. So unless issues arise affecting those six countries, it really boiled down
                    to two, Pakistan and India. Afghanistan, of course, was also under the bureau's
                    jurisdiction; nonetheless, at that time at least there was not an Afghan issue,
                    or set of issues, during the brief time that I was there. So unless there are
                    particular issues affecting the two countries one can have the time to explore
                    the rest of the building, if you will, on the East River and become more broadly
                    familiar with the work of the UN and with the mission, which is just across the
                    street.</p>
                <p>The Perm Rep at the time for the United States was Madeleine Albright, assisted
                    by several officers having ambassadorial rank, all political appointees, as I
                    recall. So I spent three or four months there, at the UN. I, of course, sat in
                    on all the Mission-wide daily staff meetings. The most interesting dimension,
                    both as I saw it at the time and in retrospect, since Ms. Albright then became
                    Secretary of State and is now a prominent personality in her own right, was
                    exposure to her style of guiding U.S. policy and managing the mission. So the
                    day would begin with a general staff meeting to which, it seemed to me,
                    virtually all employees at the mission were present, in a large room up on the
                    seventh or eighth floor. She would be flanked by her ambassadors, who would then
                    discuss among themselves the day's work or what was covered the previous day.
                    There wasn't much interaction, as I recall, with those who were in attendance
                    whose role seemed to be to observe all of this, but my memory may fail me. I'm
                    sure there were comments and interjections and a role to be played in that by
                    the counselors and anyone else who had something to contribute. After the
                    meeting, then we would have, in my case, a meeting with the political counselor,
                    a fellow by the name of Bob Gray, certainly his last name was Gray, who was a UN
                    veteran. Then we would get into much more specific issues and of course review
                    the Department's instructions and guidance and the interaction with the
                    Department that had taken place the night before, the telegrams that had come
                    in. Then we would fan out across the street to do whatever was needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>One of the more unexpected duties, parceled out in the morning, was to decide who
                    would occupy the U.S. seat or desk, whatever you want to call it. If you recall
                    the layout of the General Assembly chamber, you have all of the member countries
                    present, each one with a little name plate behind which the various delegates
                    may sit. There's room for three or four of them. It was the mission policy at
                    that time to make sure that the United States was constantly represented at all
                    of the speeches that were given by the dignitaries who, in many cases, had made
                    a special effort to fly in from their own countries to make their annual speech.
                    When our President addressed the Assembly, these sessions were very well
                    attended, and in general for very prominent and well known international
                    figures, but most speakers attracted a perfunctory attendance. But the U.S. was
                    always present, operating in the belief that our absence would be noted and that
                    it would have greater weight with that country than the absence of some others.
                    That was a responsibility that rotated among the officers of the mission, not to
                    mention advisers like me, interns, and our so-called public members. Should I
                    say fifth wheels?</p>
                <p>You never hear about the public members of the US delegation to the UN latter but
                    there are typically about six to eight at our Mission during the GA session,
                    local citizens close to the White House. They don't have much to do but bask in
                    the glory of representing the U.S. through their physical presence. In fact, the
                    ones I met were nice, serious people but had no diplomatic experience or special
                    knowledge. If nothing else, this kind of political patronage built up better
                    understanding of the UN in their communities, I suppose. At the end of the day
                    there would be a sort of a perfunctory reporting message that would summarize
                    the statements made during the day. I say perfunctory, but it may well be that
                    individual bureaus had an interest in the content of those speeches.</p>
                <p>All this made for interesting scrap-book opportunities. To this day, I regret not
                    following up with the photographers who lurked in the background recording x and
                    y occupying the Perm Rep's seat in that august setting known around the world.
                    What a great photo op! I heard of some colleagues who sent these off to their
                    home-town papers and became minor celebrities.</p>
                <p>Then of course there was the committee work, which was also interesting and a new
                    experience for me. And that's where you would see, in my case, the Indians and
                    the Pakistanis periodically clash on different issues. Of course, your other
                    responsibility was to interact with the missions of these countries, making sure
                    that you did not ignore the small countries. In my case, Nepal or Sri Lanka or
                    even the Maldives and Bangladesh. And of course there was an active social life
                    that went with that in the lounges and in the evenings. So, as I say, the time
                    went by quickly. Being in New York, of course, is an enormous and very
                    stimulating opportunity. That was one of the great attractions of the job, as
                    well. So the time went by very, very quickly. But it was for a brief period. It
                    was just for the length of the General Assembly session,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your read on the caliber and effectiveness, from
                        what you saw, of the Indian and the Pakistani delegations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: They were, the permrep position is a very senior one in their systems.
                    In fact, I got to know the Indian permanent representative quite well later on
                    in Saudi Arabia where he was the ambassador and then in India, when I was later
                    stationed there and he had retired and I saw him quite regularly. He came to my
                    home in New Delhi, we knew each other. These are key positions for them, as it
                    is for us. They were experienced professionals but they had a policy to pursue
                    and that's what they did as effectively as the UN system permits an ambassador
                    to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there for what, six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Six months. I then went to the Board of Examiners as an examiner for
                    the oral portion of the Foreign Service exam, based at the old FSI building in
                    downtown Arlington. Again, this was a really unique experience for me. As a
                    Foreign Service officer invariably you have preconceptions and possibly
                    stereotypes of how the process of recruiting new officers works. There's not
                    much transparency about it, at least there never seemed to me to be so. So
                    impressions that may or may not have been accurate at one time or the other
                    persist long years after things have changed. So for me it was really revealing,
                    particularly to see how objective the examination process was, at least as I
                    found it.</p>
                <p>In the sense that there was no way in which you could tilt or weigh or game the
                    system in favor of one candidate or the other because of how that process was
                    constructed. Meaning that the candidate would pass through a number of
                    interactions with different oral exam panel members over a full day. You worked
                    with, if not a script, at least pretty detailed guidelines and you had a grading
                    system keyed to very specific aspects of the candidate's performance. It
                    reminded me of nothing so much as of international ice skating competition,
                    where you watched the skaters on the screen and at the bottom of the screen
                    numbers pop up. Even the rating system, at least the numbers, seemed similar to
                    ours at BEX, because in skating it seems to be on a scale of, let's say, one to
                    nine and it was about the same for the foreign service exam. Meaning that
                    virtually no one got nine but most of the candidates were in the seven or eight
                    and it was, just as in skating, you would have 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5. Now
                    for you and me, as spectators watching the competition unfold on television,
                    it's often impossible to see how one is better than the other unless he really
                    crashes on the ice rink. And similarly here, too. The gradations were so fine
                    and it was cumulative over the course of the day. So you finally would wind up
                    with a candidate's score of let's say 7.4 and the cutoff for passing would be,
                    say, 7.3 and those above it were given the chance to move to the next stage and
                    those beneath it were not.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>And yet of the people who didn't quite make it, you'd be hard pressed to say
                    what, specifically, was their shortcoming. You could document it; in fact you
                    had to do so in writing at each step, because you had to justify iand to protect
                    the system against law suits, I believe. Those records of each candidate's
                    performance throughout the day are retained on file for a long time. The oral
                    exam process was very revealing also of the caliber of candidates. The quality
                    of people who made it through the written exam and then into the orals was very
                    high. We examiners all told ourselves that we probably could not make it through
                    the exam process! We also traveled. As BEX panel members, we operated not only
                    in Washington but would travel to different parts of the country and be in a
                    particular spot for a week or two, interviewing candidates and applying this
                    same process there. Wherever we went, we encountered just great people, many
                    with wonderful experience - job experience, academic experience, language
                    experience, life experience. So it gave me great confidence in the ability of
                    the service to recruit good people.</p>
                <p>It also gave me great confidence in, I repeat, the objectivity of the system
                    whereby notwithstanding the emphasis by the system, and rightly so, on making
                    the Foreign Service officer corps representative of the nation's diversity,
                    there were no special breaks given to anybody. You either passed on your own
                    merit or you didn't. Even if you wanted to, you really couldn't skew it. So
                    those who are there today, at least as a result of that kind of process, as I
                    observed and worked in it, merited it. I mean they got in on their own.</p>
                <p>So that, to me, was a very revealing and a good experience, I must say, and I
                    would often make that point to others, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't feel pressure about admitting more
                        minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, in terms of what I was doing, no, none whatsoever. There was no
                    attempt, when I was there, to do that. Obviously, there's an effort. Ironically
                    my son, who's in the advertising business, his employer has the contract for
                    recruitment advertisement for the Department and he himself is personally
                    involved in this. So I know that then, as well as now, there's an outreach to
                    minorities and perhaps less so to women. At one time there was a real push to
                    get more women. And particular kinds of minorities. Hispanics, for example, are
                    in very short supply. Asians, you've got plenty of candidates there.
                    African-Americans, while the push had been there in the past, it's still very
                    active today but they particularly want to reach out to Hispanics. So the
                    recruitment effort, the advertising, getting the information out, targeting
                    various schools and workplaces where you have a good chance of contacting
                    qualified minorities and bringing the Foreign Service to their attention, yes,
                    that is there. But in terms of the examination process that I've described and
                    that I was part of, no. There was no pressure. If you had a minority candidate,
                    he or she was treated exactly as anyone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Arabic. From when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I took Arabic from August of '94 to the following June or July. It was
                    the first year of the two- year language program, meaning that I did not go to
                    Tunis for the follow-up year in the region. I had been offered the job of
                    political counselor in New Delhi but because of my wife's job commitment that
                    she had made when we came back from Nepal, I didn't feel that we could leave at
                    that time. That was why I had this year in which to be at the UN and to go into
                    the Board of Examiners. But I had been very interested in diversifying myself
                    somewhat so when the Saudi opening came up, I was glad to get it. By that time I
                    had been promoted, after I left the refugee program, I'd been promoted into the
                    Senior Foreign Service. And there were not many candidates at that level for the
                    political counselor, which was an OC or Counselor level job. Counselors tend to
                    seek management positions, such as DCM-ships, rather than political section head
                    jobs. That didn't bother me as I had already had plenty of management
                    experience.</p>
                <p>NEA was not particularly enamored of having an outsider come in for that job,
                    given the high profile of Riyadh in the Bureau. But when you have a candidate
                    who's at the grade level and had my professional experience and was willing to
                    take Arabic, there was not very much that they could object to. So I studied
                    Arabic for a year. By that time NFTAC (National Foreign Affairs Training Center)
                    had been opened, so the training was here in Arlington. It included a month in
                    Jordan, in Kerak, in April 1995. You wouldn't do this today for security
                    reasons, but Kerak is a small provincial city, about two to three hours south of
                    Amman, and two hours east of Petra, with an old Crusader fort. We stayed, a
                    group of us, about eight or nine of us, stayed at a little hotel. In the morning
                    we attended lectures in Arabic at a local university and in the afternoon we had
                    hired students and we just walked around town for several hours, practicing our
                    spoken Arabic, as we did among ourselves in the evening. It was our stab at
                    language immersion</p>
                <p>Because I did not take the two year program, which to this day I regret, but
                    there was just no way in which I could do it, I was determined to concentrate on
                    the speaking portion of the language training. As I stated earlier, my
                    observation, when I had studied Hindi, was that the reading portion of that
                    training was not of much use to me in India, where everything was in English. So
                    you never got to use it. It would have been much better to tilt your time
                    towards speaking competency. So that's really what I emphasized in Arabic. I did
                    all right in the reading portion of the test, but I really focused on the spoken
                    language and, of course, immersing myself, through all of the lectures and
                    readings that they give you on Saudi Arabia, the Gulf, Middle East, Arab culture
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were you when you were taking this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was, let me see, this was in '95, so I would have been 54. That's an
                    interesting question for you to raise.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, because the older you get ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Now, be careful of what you say, Stu, because you're playing into
                    stereotypes. That was one I encountered repeatedly. People would say, “Oh,
                    you're studying Arabic, such a hard language and at your age.” I don't accept
                    that at all. I grew up bilingual and I've never had any difficulty with
                    languages. I studied a lot of Spanish, for example, in college and still speak
                    and read it fairly well, and then Hindi and Urdu, becoming very proficient. It's
                    a question of attitude and whether you're intimidated by the prospect and I was
                    not intimidated by studying Arabic. So I never had any problem and it was not a
                    big issue. So I spent a year doing that. I truly regret, deeply regret I did not
                    spend that second year in Tunis, because what I found, just to go ahead a little
                    bit, when I arrived in Riyadh, I had by that time a two plus in spoken Arabic. I
                    had made an enormous effort to get that. It's not an easy language. I arrive in
                    Riyadh and no one speaks Arabic there. The whole Saudi elite has been educated
                    in the United States. They all speak English. There were no less than three
                    English language dailies in Riyadh. The foreign population is so enormous,
                    thirty to forty per cent of the population and they all speak English. That's
                    why they're recruited to come there. So English is really the lingua franca. So
                    to keep up with your Arabic, particularly if you've not had the two-year
                    program, is very difficult.</p>
                <p>Just to add to that, unlike my experience in India and in Pakistan, where I could
                    have private tutors who could come to my home at six in the morning and which I
                    would pay for. They would be on their way to work as teachers, for example and
                    they would come by to my house and we would just chat in Hindi or in Urdu for a
                    full hour and then I would have breakfast and go on to the office. I would do
                    this on a daily basis and I hoped to do that in Riyadh as well. But
                    unfortunately the embassy and our residences are all in an area called the
                    Diplomatic Quarter, which is a little ghetto and there are no Saudis who live
                    there. And security is a big issue, it was even then. So it's not possible to
                    have a tutor and the embassy language program is not suitable. I had studied on
                    a much higher level than would be appropriate for that class and I just didn't
                    have the time, either, during the day. So my Arabic really suffered, as a result
                    of that. It would not have suffered as much if I had had that two-year
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you got there, you were in Saudi Arabia from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I was there for five years. I was there from July, of '95, to July of
                    2000. For three I was political counselor and for two years I was deputy chief
                    of mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood our relations with Saudi Arabia when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: They were very good. In my view, Saudi Arabia is a much maligned
                    country but very few of its critics, very few people speak with any degree of
                    knowledge, I mean substantive knowledge, about it. So it's a country about which
                    there are tremendous misperceptions. But the relationship was a very close one,
                    a very collaborative one. It was throughout that period. We had enormous
                    interests in Saudi Arabia, particularly at that time, from military cooperation
                    - our largest military aid missions were therto commercial interests, the trade
                    relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia being larger than that of all of
                    the other Middle East countries, including Israel, put together. And the energy
                    relationship is vital to us. The role of the Saudis in the Gulf is also
                    absolutely key to the U.S. position in the Gulf. The cooperation on political
                    issues, consultations and dialogue, was also vital. So all of this was in place
                    when I arrived in 1995 and it continued, despite growing strains and problems in
                    the relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Noticing, I think, in the paper today, our Secretary of
                        State, Condoleezza Rice, has just come back from the Middle East or maybe
                        she's still there, but some of the columnists are saying, “Here we are,
                        talking about bringing democracy and stopping human rights abuses and Saudi
                        Arabia is the worst violators of all these things.” Was this in the air when
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, certainly, the way I'd put it is that Saudi Arabia is a country
                    with which we have enormous shared interests and virtually no shared values. You
                    can calibrate the U.S.-Saudi relationship almost to the last dime or you can
                    measure it almost to the last dime, because the interests are very quantifiable
                    and very specific. But we have virtually no shared values. By contrast, for
                    example, with India, we had for many years relatively few shared interests but
                    enormous shared values and in the long term the shared values are just as
                    important, if not more important, than the shared interests. In terms of popular
                    understanding, public understanding and public support for the relationship in
                    the United States, that is the great weakness of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. We
                    were conscious of it from the very beginning. We had to write a human rights
                    report, for example, each year and we had a similar Congressionally mandated
                    religious freedom report. We had constant problems on the issue of religious
                    freedom. Cases being brought to our attention of the religious police harassing,
                    many times arresting, mistreating, Christians who were practicing their
                    religion. We had issues of consular access arising out of American women who had
                    married Saudis and then getting divorced or separated from their husbands and
                    wishing, indeed they were desperate for, access to and a relationship with their
                    children. That was a constant problem there. We faced constant congressional
                    inquiries on very particular complaints. So yes, human rights, civil rights,
                    religious rights, were very much a part of our agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: The ambassador then was Ambassador Ray Mabus. Ambassador Mabus had been
                    governor of Mississippi and was a personal friend of President Clinton. They
                    both were of the same generation, same sort of southern political background. He
                    was there for a year and then was succeeded by Ambassador Wyche Fowler, former
                    Democratic senator from the state of Georgia. So those were the two ambassadors
                    in the five years that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stick to the ambassadors, how did you see they worked? I
                        mean, here are men out of the American political scene thrust into an area
                        that very few Americans know how to deal with, including foreign
                        service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That's right. Their value to the relationship, and as the Saudis saw
                    them, was that they had a personal tie with the president. The Saudis definitely
                    prefer a political ambassador to a career ambassador. We've not had many career
                    ambassadors and when we did have one there in the late 80's , Hume Horan, he was
                    PNGed (declared persona non grata), in effect, within a very short time of his
                    arrival. I don't want to generalize, but the Saudis, I believe firmly, prefer,
                    by and large, political ambassadors. I mean they've never said that but that was
                    certainly my reading of them. The ambassador, whether it was Ambassador Mabus or
                    certainly Ambassador Fowler, whom I got to know very well, had full access to
                    the Saudi leadership. The American ambassador was always the envy of his
                    ambassadorial colleagues because he could request a meeting with Crown Prince
                    Abdullah or with King Fahd, before he had his stroke, and with other senior
                    princes - and it is the royal family that definitely runs that country - and be
                    received within a day or two. Access was never an issue for the American
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well one of the things, at least within Foreign Service
                        ranks, is that, this also applies to Morocco, where the king there preferred
                        political ambassadors because he didn't like Arabists because he felt they
                        knew where the bodies were buried or something like that. Is that the
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: You know, I'm skeptical of that. I think from the perspective of the
                    Saudi leadership, they've been around a long time. They've dealt with the United
                    States for decades now. Their ambassador here, Prince Bandar, would be the dean
                    of the diplomatic corps, if he allowed himself to be so. He's been here since
                    the early Eighties. They've gone through one administration after the other.
                    They've dealt with many ambassadors. My point in mentioning this is that for
                    them what counts, far more, is access to the very top levels of the U.S.
                    administration, the U.S. government. That's how Middle East culture works. I
                    mean the ambassador, when he was seeking a meeting and was under instructions,
                    he didn't ask to see the minister of labor or the minister of finance, he would
                    go to the, I mean sometimes he would if it was a technical issue. But if it was
                    truly important he would go to see the crown prince or the king. To have an
                    ambassador who was a personal friend of the president, that counted far more
                    than having some, let's face it, bureaucrat like myself or someone else who
                    arrives, who may be deeply versed in the culture but who ranks in our system
                    down on the totem pole from the assistant secretary, the under secretary, and
                    the secretary of state. That's not the way they want to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find while you were there, with Prince Bandar the
                        Saudi ambassador in Washington, was he a power unto himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, Prince Bandar would, I recall, come to Saudi Arabia maybe twice a
                    year. He did not necessarily make a beeline for our ambassador. And again, this
                    is sort of how their system works. There's a pecking order of princes and in the
                    royal family which now includes thousands of members. Prince Bandar has his
                    place there but he is not one of the senior princes. He can advise, he can
                    guide, they have confidence in him. They're very pleased that he has the access
                    and the personal relationships he has developed in Washington but he's not the
                    one who's making Saudi policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were there, what were the, let's start when
                        you arrived. In the first place, in a country that doesn't have a political
                        system, or at least a democratic political system, what does the political
                        counselor do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: As I said at the outset, the relationship is a very broad one. We have
                    a lot of very specific problems or areas for discussion that arise on a daily,
                    on a continuing basis. Many included the common issues that arise in any normal
                    diplomatic relationship for a political counselor to deal with, such as UN
                    votes, politics in the Gulf affecting neighboring countries, reaction to the
                    Bosnian events, Middle East peace process questions, visiting Congressional
                    delegations etc. which consumed a lot of effort. Then there were issues unique
                    to the bilateral relationship, probably the most important of which at the time
                    of my arrival and over the years was the pol-mil relationship, military to
                    military relationship. We had two military missions. One that was working with
                    the Saudi Arabian National Guard and the other one with the Saudi Arabian
                    Ministry of Defense. Now the Saudi Arabian National Guard reported directly to
                    Crown Prince, now King, Abdullah, who is their commander. The ministry of
                    defense reports to the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Abdullah's half-brother,
                    and now Crown Prince. Those are very separate organizations, each with its own
                    U.S. training mission, fully paid for, fully funded by the Saudis. There were no
                    concessionary terms for them. If we speak of the supply of F-15 aircraft to the
                    Saudi air force and training in its use, that relationship is with the ministry
                    of defense. With the Saudi Arabian National Guard the mil-mil relationship
                    consisted primarily of relatively low-tech training. But each of these missions
                    employed several hundred Americans, military, as well as civilian contractors.
                    They were there on a continuing basis. They'd been there for the past thirty or
                    forty years, and presumably they are still there. That's a very important part
                    of our commercial relationship, too, I might add., although it's rarely counted
                    as such. In other words, our U.S. defense contractors have a big stake in the
                    successful operation of these missions. Anyone who tells you that doesn't carry
                    weight in the overall political relationship is fooling himself.</p>
                <p>But in addition to this, we also had Operation Southern Watch (OSW), U.S. Air
                    Force wings deployed to Saudi Arabia to keep an eye on Iraq, on Saddam Hussein,
                    which had been based in Saudi Arabia since the Gulf War. Their presence
                    represented quite a significant commitment on our side and a political risk, as
                    we have since learned, on the Saudi side, to have this large U.S. military
                    presence in the kingdom. My point in detailing all of this is that it involved
                    constant problems that would come up and would have to be resolved by the
                    embassy and often by the ambassador. In other countries, you would have the
                    military attach�s who might be able to handle such issues, and many were handled
                    that way, not to mention by the training missions themselves. I don't want to
                    suggest otherwise. But in Riyadh the embassy was the big focal point for
                    nurturing the whole broad spectrum of the bilateral relationship, including its
                    formidable military component, unlike other countries where the military
                    operated independently of the Ambassador. In Riyadh, the heads of the training
                    missions, general officers, were very much members of the country team.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>For example, whether it was funding for fuel for OSW - who's going to pay for
                    that, if there is a surge that carries costs beyond what was budgeted? Who's
                    going to pay for the upgrade of the radar capabilities or for added costs with
                    Patriot missiles based in the country, or to station new missiles after some
                    provocative action by Saddam? Who's going to pay for new housing to accommodate
                    any additional personnel who might be sent there? Or how do we find, build, and
                    pay for the new housing required after Khobar when the US personnel at the Saudi
                    air station at Dhahran were moved from in-town apartment housing to more easily
                    secured and isolated compounds in Riyadh? These were big issues for both sides,
                    especially for the Saudis whose oil was selling for $10 a barrel in the late
                    90's and thus faced a major budget crunch. High-powered U.S. delegations came
                    out precisely to discuss such issues. Funding issues were a major and constant
                    element of our bilateral dialogue, including prodding for payments on existing
                    contracts and earlier obligations. There is that image of the Saudis swimming in
                    oil wealth, which may be true today when oil sells at $60 a barrel, but
                    certainly wasn't then.</p>
                <p>There might be accidents, U.S. personnel killed on the highway between Prince
                    Sultan Airbase where the OSW aircraft were stationed and Riyadh; how do you
                    handle the disposition of remains? Given the nature of their system, all of this
                    funnels up to the top. So the embassy was very engaged on these issues. We had a
                    political-military counselor as well myself as a political counselor, but we
                    worked together very closely on this in supporting the Ambassador and in working
                    with the senior U.S. military officers stationed in the kingdom who would seek
                    our engagement and support in resolving these questions and I must say, nine
                    times out of ten, we worked out acceptable arrangements with the Saudis. And the
                    USG not only sought money for purely U.S. Saudi purposes but for broader foreign
                    policy causes as well.</p>
                <p>When I arrived we had the Bosnia War going on. We were very keen to have Saudi
                    financial assistance to support humanitarian operations in the Balkans. Or it
                    might be for Palestinian aid, African disaster relief, whatevethe Administration
                    would try to tap Saudi coffers because it had no money of its own readily at
                    hand or not enough. We called it 'tin-cupping the Kingdom.” We had special
                    envoys come out to meet with them on some of these worthy causes. I must say
                    that normally, the Saudis kept their hands on their wallets in such cases.
                    Throughout my five years, we had a constant flow of high level visitors, CODELs.
                    The Secretary of Defense, SecDef, would be out there twice a year. You'd have
                    the CINCs, the CENTCOM commander, there. You would have the individual air force
                    and army generals from the Pentagon, and then very regularly, the senior-most
                    air force and army generals in CENTCOM. You would have representatives of the
                    joint Chief of Staff travel to Riyadh or Jeddah where the king lived and where
                    the Crown Prince resided for several months each year. There was a constant flow
                    of senior Americans, up to the Vice President, who wanted to interact with the
                    Saudis and the political section handled much of this in support of the
                    Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>In addition, we had our domestic reporting which became increasingly important as
                    Islamist pressure manifested itself. That was a key priority for us. Keep in
                    mind that the Saudis did not allow any journalists, American or other
                    journalists, into the kingdom, nor any tourists. There is virtually no academic
                    expertise in the United States on Saudi Arabia, at least on their politics.
                    There are no exchanges of scholars. There are no independent travelers. No
                    foreigner can enter Saudi Arabia without sponsorship, without Saudi sponsorship.
                    In other words, the whole network of contacts that existed, for example, between
                    the United States and the Soviet Union, even in the darkest days of the Cold
                    War, was not replicated in Saudi Arabia. Which meant that the burden fell on the
                    embassy and on the political section in particular to try to explain what was
                    happening, to analyze what were the currents, as we could discern them, in Saudi
                    Arabia. And then, of course, you have your routine reporting which can be very
                    time consuming. I say routine, not that it's not important, but on human rights
                    report, which would take a lot of an officer's time for several months, and you
                    would have the religious freedom report. And, again, because these were very
                    widely read public documents, you had to make a special effort to keep abreast
                    of what was happening in these areas, or not happening. And there were others as
                    well. So we were very busy, I can assure you.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about, there are all sorts of people and I
                        think there are several women particularly who have written extensively on
                        Saudi Arabia. They've made trips and all. Were these people around or were
                        they picking up information from somewhere else somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: You mean Americans? We did not see very many of them. As I've said, you
                    could not enter the country without sponsorship. So you had to have a defined
                    purpose. And it's not easy, once you get into the country then to sort of wander
                    around. There are a lot of barriers. And you mention women. Sandra Mackey comes
                    to mind but she was married to someone living there, working with one of the
                    private companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one of the issues, what about women at the American
                        air force base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: To be honest with you, the times that I visited, I went quite often
                    down to Prince Sultan Air Force Base, I do not recall seeing any American female
                    military personnel. Nor at the residential compound on the outskirts of Riyadh
                    although there were many spouses. The military missions certainly didn't have
                    any women attached to them. I know in the Gulf War there were reports of
                    problems that female military personnel faced. But during the time I was there
                    that was not really a big issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the issues which comes to the forefront since 9/1,
                        according to some reports, the Saudis have sort of made a pact with, I'm
                        talking about the royal family, made a pact with the devil, if you want to
                        call it, and that is with the religious leaders. You can do whatever you
                        want, just stay away from us. And that you had these schools, not just in
                        Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan and eastern Africa and other places, where imams
                        or mullahs , preaching hatred of foreigners, the Americans. Was this
                        something you were monitoring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: This really raises the whole issue of terrorism and the role of
                    anti-terrorism, in our relationship. I arrived in July of '95. King Fahd
                    experienced or suffered a stroke in November of '95 which incapacitated him and
                    led to Crown Prince Abdullah, taking charge of the government and that remains
                    the case to this day. Fahd, I might add, from a medical perspective, made a
                    remarkable recovery, having survived all these years but he's not capable of
                    managing the country. So he continues to have an honorary role. I mention this
                    because the change in leadership really prompted us, within the embassy and
                    within my section in particular, to take a very close look at Saudi leadership
                    issues and patterns of succession. Who were the new contenders? What were the
                    implications of Abdullah taking over from Fahd? What was his relationship with
                    Prince Sultan, who was the minister of defense and regarded as the likely
                    successor to Abdullah? More broadly, we examined the relationship of these
                    individual princes and of the royal family to the society at large. This effort,
                    which was a major priority for us, was accelerated by the fact that at that same
                    time, in November '95, a terrorist bomb explosion occurred in downtown Riyadh,
                    at the office of the U.S. mission supporting the Saudi Arabian National Guard,
                    in which five Americans were killed and others were wounded. This was the first
                    terrorist attack on the Americans in Saudi Arabia, at least that I'm aware of.
                    Now no one claimed responsibility but questions were raised as to why it had
                    occurred, what was its background. Within a relatively short period of time, the
                    Saudis arrested the perpetrators, the alleged perpetrators, of this attack, who
                    then made a confession on television that they were Islamicly motivated. As I
                    recall, this was in February or March of '96. So one immediate consequence was
                    to reexamine our security posture and I'll come to that, dwell on this at
                    greater length later on. But the other one was to really take a closer look at
                    the Saudi internal scene.</p>
                <p>In June of 1996 there was a second terrorist attack, at Khobar, on the eastern
                    coast, just outside of Dhahran, in which a truck bomb exploded outside an
                    apartment building which housed a number of U.S. military personnel who were
                    attached to the office helping the Saudis at the local Saudi air base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Khobar Towers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yes, Khobar Towers. Nineteen Americans were killed. I might add, if I
                    recall correctly, 18 were killed by glass, flying glass. It could have been
                    avoided. So 19 servicemen were killed, plus five a few months earlier, for a
                    total of 24 Americans and many more injured. That prompted a tremendous review
                    in Washington as well as in the field, in Riyadh itself, of what was going on,
                    what was happening, how do we respond to this, what is driving that. The
                    suspicion and very strong belief that developed very quickly was that, in one
                    way or the other, the Iranians were behind the Khobar attack, if not the first
                    one. None of this is particularly secret today but at the time it was closely
                    held. Individual names of Iranian operatives surfaced and of course the concern
                    was that the Iranians were perhaps working through the local Shiite community to
                    target Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is fairly strong in the Eastern Province.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: There's a very strong Shiite presence in the Eastern Province of Saudi
                    Arabia, particularly around the oil fields there, Aramco and the like. The FBI
                    finally managed to open an office in Riyadh and we began developing it, but it
                    took quite a bit of doing and I must say the ambassador deserves a lot of the
                    credit for being able to push it through, this was Ambassador Fowler, for being
                    able to bring the Saudis around to cooperation on the investigation. But
                    obviously it was in their interest as well. They saw what a powerful reaction
                    there was in the United States. The whole foundation of the relationship was
                    being questioned. With subsequent attacks in Yemen on the USS Cole and on our
                    embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, with which bin Laden and Al-Qaeda became
                    identified, the focus shifted to the Sunni versus Shiite dimension of terrorism.
                    In addition to trying to get the Saudis to apply pressure on the Taliban in
                    Afghanistan to take action against bin Laden in Afghanistan, we continued to
                    look more closely at the relationship between the Sunni religious establishment
                    in the kingdom and the royal family.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>So to come to your question, you start with the foundations of Saudi Arabia, a
                    religious and political pact between the Wahhabi strand of Islamic teaching and
                    philosophy and the al Saud, which has existed for almost two hundred years. This
                    was not something new. I think you expressed it pretty accurately in saying
                    that, “We'll do our thing and you do yours.” And it wasn't merely an
                    opportunistic alliance. Nor was it a conspiracy. I think that there is a deep
                    conviction that it is the Al-Saud responsibility as guardians of the holy
                    shrines. The king's title formal title in Saudi Arabia is “Guardian and
                    Protector of the Two Holy Shrines”, Medina and Mecca. They had a responsibility,
                    as they saw it for many years, to support Islam, to propagate it. Supporting and
                    propagating not only at home by creating a social and educational system that
                    reflected a strict version of Islam; not only in terms of their enormous
                    investment in infrastructure at Mecca, in particular, to allow millions of
                    Muslims from around the world to conduct the hajj pilgrimage in a comfortable
                    and efficient manner; but also to support organizations that tried to propagate
                    Islam around the world. That's where you have the funding relationships
                    developing with about half a dozen of these organizations. And it was not just a
                    question of the royal family. It was an obligation on business people, on the
                    Saudi public. There's a deep belief that this is an appropriate role for Saudis
                    to play. They see themselves as special in the Arab world and in the Muslim
                    world because Arabia is their holy land. That's the rationale for not permitting
                    foreign places of public worship for other religions. You point out, well in
                    Kuwait and in Jordan and many other Muslim countries, Christians and Jews and
                    Hindus and whatever, Buddhists, can all worship freely. “Well, yes, that's fine
                    there but we're the holy land, we can't permit it here.” And they'll quote a
                    statement by the Prophet Mohammed to that effect. So there was this. There was
                    this part of their outlook and therefore of their policy which had been in place
                    for many years. And as they grew wealthy, they were able to funnel funds to
                    these organizations, over which, once they left Saudi Arabia, they had no
                    control, or very little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able, when you were political counselor, to
                        say, “I'd like to see copies of the syllabus or the textbooks of what's
                        being taught in, say the Saudi religious schools or universities or in the
                        grammar school level.” Were we looking at that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, at that time, we did not. We did not go into that level of detail
                    in our reporting, as I recall. I mean, we knew in a general sense, not so much
                    at the primary and secondary level but at the university level, that it was a
                    very narrow view of Islam and, in fact, the whole curriculum was tightly
                    controlled by the religious leadership. That was their province, implementing
                    the compact between the Wahabi establishment and the Al-Saud. That was no secret
                    but the concern expressed for a long time was couched as an economic development
                    issue. Here was a country having incredible oil resources that had achieved
                    staggering progress in building infrastructure and the wherewithal of a modern
                    country, and yet their educational system was overwhelmingly tilted towards
                    teaching subjects that had little or no practical value. The Saudi leadership
                    was well aware of the disconnect of having a high population growth rate,
                    producing large numbers of young men who couldn't find jobs, and yet at the same
                    time also having in their country an enormous population of foreigners doing the
                    work. The problem was not that the economy didn't generate jobs but that they
                    weren't being filled by Saudis. So the issue of religious predominance and
                    control of education was viewed in these terms, rather than in terms of the
                    basic philosophy that was being taught at lower levels, which is the issue that
                    arose after 9/11, when scrutiny of Saudi textbooks revealed a consistent theme
                    of active hostility and even aggression against non-Muslims being drummed into
                    young students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things you mentioned was infrastructure. Saudi
                        Arabia has, you might say, a terrible reputation and everything, but when
                        you take a look at what it has done with its oil wealth - yes, the princes
                        have done well and all that but there was a tremendous infrastructure that
                        was built. You take a country like Nigeria, where the oil goes out and is
                        practically pumped to Geneva or Zurich, where it goes into the bank accounts
                        and nothing is happening. And in so many other countries. A significant part
                        of Saudi riches have gone to help the people, I use this qualified term,
                        because it really hasn't done much for the youth, in preparing them to
                        become responsible citizens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I think I would agree with you. I recall seeing home films of Americans
                    who had been there for many, many years, made back in the Sixties of Riyadh and
                    what it was like when I was there, 35 years later. The change was
                    incredible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Dhahran in the Fifties. It was a sleepy little
                        town. Also, the Trucial States, as they were called in those days. Dhows
                        beached. Great things have been done and a significant portion of the
                        investment has gone to the people, which has not been the case in a lot of
                        other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I agree with you. Partly I think it's again the Bedouin and tribal
                    mentality, if you will, where the royal family does not exist in isolation. The
                    Al-Saud are woven into the very fabric of Saudi society. King Abdul Aziz, the
                    founder of Saudi Arabia, is famous for his matrimonial policy. I don't know how
                    many marriages he contracted but he made a very specific point of marriages with
                    tribal leaderships across Arabia so that he would build a network of family
                    ties. So to with his sons and daughters, of whom there are many and then their
                    grandchildren and the like. It's very hard to separate them from Saudi Arabia.
                    It's striking when you look at the Moroccan and Jordanian and some other royal
                    families. They're a handful of people. And then you look at the Saudi royal
                    family. Which is why I think that system, that political system, has much more
                    stamina than people give it credit for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the late Fifties, when I was in Dhahran, one of the
                        questions was, how long will the Saudi rule last? The answer was, probably
                        not very long. We were looking at almost everything those days being run by
                        the Palestinians. Which was a dangerous mix. Now they are run by
                        Bangladeshis, who are no threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yeah, that's exactly it. And they're very shrewd. In 1990, at the time
                    of the Gulf War, when Arafat endorsed Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait,
                    that was interpreted by the Saudi leadership as in effect inviting Saddam to
                    occupy Saudi Arabia, particularly given the rhetoric that Saddam was employing
                    at the time. They immediately expelled the Palestinians. They expelled the
                    Yemenis whose president voiced similar views. The only significant foreign Arab
                    presence now in Saudi Arabia are the Egyptians but they're greatly outnumbered
                    by people from Asia, who, Muslim or not, cannot obtain citizenship, they don't
                    speak the language, they have nothing in common, they have no desire to remain
                    permanently. They're guest workers in the real sense of the word and they
                    represent no political threat to the Saudis. So they've been able to maintain
                    political stability for a long time and I see no sign that this is in any way in
                    jeopardy at present. Now I've been away for several years. I may be misreading
                    them but I think they have a lot of political assets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well tell me, let's go back to Khobar Towers. I was
                        interviewing, I believe it was Wayne White, who was an INR analyst who dealt
                        with this, among other things and he was saying that it became quite clear
                        early on that the Iranians probably were behind this but that the Saudis
                        didn't want this to come out. And at the same time things were happening in
                        Iran where we were feeling things were changing in Iran, getting more
                        liberal. So the whole thing was an attitude, held both by the United States
                        and by the Saudis, sort of we didn't follow it to the close. Was this your
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Certainly I think on the part of the Saudis, they were very reluctant
                    to publicly identify the Iranians. I think that the most compelling reason is
                    that they were uncertain what the American reaction would be if evidence became
                    overwhelming and incontrovertible that the Iranians were in fact behind this.
                    And as I say, though the view favoring Iranian responsibility emerged very soon
                    in Washington, I'm not sure there was conclusive, absolutely dead-sure kind of
                    evidence, within a reasonable period of time, that the Iranians were involved.
                    To the extent that the Saudis feared that such evidence might be uncovered, then
                    our reaction would become unpredictable for then. They had their own problems
                    with the Iranians and they were not inclined to roil those waters. So I think
                    that this hesitation or this ambivalence, maybe that's the better word,
                    ambivalence, created a feeling among many Americans, particularly on the
                    investigative side, that they were not getting full access to the information
                    that the Saudis had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also from Wayne, Wayne White, he felt that some punches
                        were being pulled at the NSC, at the top, I guess Sandy Berger, level,
                        because of what was perceived as being a change in Iran. Hope, which I
                        guess, springs eternal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I recall Rafsanjani, who's now, ironically, again candidate for
                    president, had just taken office and he was viewed as maybe a bit little more
                    liberal. I know the Saudis had great fears of the Iranians, particularly, for
                    example, in their ability to disrupt the hajj.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did it once.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They did it once, that's right, in 1987, I believe. It took on an
                    anti-American tinge, thousands of Iranian pilgrims hoisting Khomeini placards
                    and shouting slogans in the most sacred precincts of the Grand Mosque, which
                    deeply shocked the Saudis. In fact, there was a clash in Mecca then in which
                    several hundred people were killed. This event, this politicization of the Hajj,
                    was especially troubling because it jeopardized the Saudi reputation for
                    managing a peaceful hajj for all Muslims. Guardianship of the Holy Places is
                    their unshakable claim to legitimacy at home and in the Muslim world. This is an
                    area of real vulnerability for them and they know that the Iranians know they
                    can push that button. So regarding Khobar, they perhaps handled them in very
                    gingerly fashion, as they did regarding the Iranian occupation of disputed
                    islands on the coast of Bahrain and the UAE. The Saudis were quite restrained in
                    commenting publicly on this and in responding to the pressure for a stronger
                    stance that came from some of their Gulf neighbors. So I think that was part of
                    it, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You referred, you were going to talk more about sort of
                        security.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, these explosions, and particularly the one at Khobar June 1996,
                    were the turning point, not just for our security posture in Saudi Arabia, but
                    even worldwide for U.S. embassies because it was clear that we had an
                    ideological adversary targeting Americans in our most vulnerable locations. To
                    that extent, perhaps, it differed from the attack on the Marines in the early
                    Eighties in Beirut, where you might argue it happened in response to the
                    immediate situation at the time. In any event, we immediately redeployed our
                    military missions and presence in Saudi Arabia. We reduced our footprint, as
                    they say. For example, the U.S. military presence at the base in Dhahran was
                    terminated. We consolidated our assets at the Prince Sultan Airbase which is in
                    central Saudi Arabia, south of Riyadh, about 60-70 miles south of Riyadh, where
                    we had not had much infrastructure, in part because it was in the middle of
                    nowhere, therefore more difficult to attack, easier to defend, to isolate. We
                    placed tremendous new constraints on the movement of our military personnel in
                    public, for example, in Riyadh. In the embassy we took a whole series of
                    measures, which included closing off several streets around the embassy, of
                    course working with the Saudi government on this. And again the ambassador had
                    to go to the top to get approval for this. The interior minister, Prince Nayif,
                    was very reluctant to permit it, regarding it as a challenge to the Saudi
                    obligation to guarantee security. So we closed off several streets, we developed
                    physical barriers, we expanded the open space around the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a bomb blast area, the farther away it occurs, the
                        less likely a car bomb can kill and damage.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: That's right. Over time, as quickly as funding and construction
                    permitted the building itself was strengthened, and access to it was greatly
                    tightened. We redeployed housing for many of our people. Not so difficult in
                    Riyadh because we were already in the Diplomatic Quarter, as I mentioned. In
                    Dhahran and in Jeddah, there was considerable strengthening of the perimeter
                    defenses around the compound of the two consulates there, including units of the
                    Saudi Arabian National Guard on permanent guard there as well. Our U.S.
                    contractor community took many similar steps. Security around the American
                    school took the same pattern as around the Embassy. Security became the
                    watchword for all of us and that continued throughout the remainder of the
                    period that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any movements within Saudi society, I'm
                        thinking of women's ability to drive cars and other things. Were there any
                        other groups than women trying to get somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>THINBAULT: Just before I had arrived, and this was almost a precursor of bin
                    Laden and the fundamentalist reaction against the United States and the Saudi
                    leadership, you had had several preachers in the town of Qassim arrested. They
                    had been circulating manifestos directed against the Saudi leadership and
                    cassette tapes of some of their sermons had also circulated. So that really put
                    an end, at least for several years, of any consideration of change in the
                    political system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These cassettes, they were attacking the government for
                        being too liberal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, yes, for compromising on Islamic principles. You had Saudi exiles
                    in London who were flooding the country with faxes denouncing the royal family.
                    Ironically, the net result of this was to frighten many people into believing
                    that the fundamentalists had more clout and more influence than had been
                    appreciated. The view emerged, particularly among the more educated Saudis and
                    particularly the ones whom we saw, that the Saudi princes were more liberal than
                    their society as a whole. You did not see any movement towards women driving or
                    any liberalization of restrictions on religious worship. You had a response by
                    the leadership of holding back on whatever might be their personal or natural
                    impulses to bring their society up to contemporary standards because they felt
                    vulnerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose part of the thing was their saying, “Okay, fine,
                        we have a democracy, it'll be one vote and that'll be the end of it. It'll
                        turn into a fundamentalist society.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: At least my experience there was that there were very few advocating
                    fully representative democracy. They have an advisory council called the Shura,
                    all appointed members. The steps that were being advocated at that time were to
                    make their proceedings more transparent, to draw from a wider spectrum of
                    society, to allow a broader agenda than had normally been discussed, to allow
                    media reporting on their meetings and discussions, these sorts of things. Not
                    that this should become an elective body. For two reasons, I think. In part
                    because, as you say, there was a concern about who might become elected as a
                    result of that. I think that what you have to give greater weight to was the
                    strongly held belief that an Islamic political system should not necessarily
                    reflect or, in their words, “ape” Western norms. Saudi Arabia, I emphasize, is a
                    deeply, deeply conservative and very religious society. It's easy to list all of
                    its shortcomings by our standards but I think in many ways the Saudi leadership
                    has its finger to the political wind and they're extremely sensitive to what
                    they think public opinion will accept. They would not have survived as long as
                    they have without that ability to discern public opinion. Moreover, the family
                    is so large and then the tribal connections are such that their tentacles and
                    their antennae extend to all corners. I have often seen Crown Prince Abdullah
                    and other senior princes in their courts receiving hundreds of petitioners. They
                    are open to any and all, held weekly and often more frequently, and people turn
                    out in large numbers. There's a constant flow of people who come to see them.
                    These men are not necessarily isolated from public opinion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The majlis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: The majlis, exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I watched this, where the cousin of the King, was the emir
                        of Eastern Province, this is back to the old court. But people were coming
                        in on all sorts of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Exactly, and this continues to this day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Equivalent to an American town meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: So, it's not that they are isolated. This is not a Shah of Iran kind of
                    situation. They're much closer to their people than we give them credit for. You
                    saw it reflected in Secretary Rice's visit, you mentioned it, a couple of days
                    ago in Riyadh. She met with Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, graduate of
                    Princeton, absolutely urbane, extremely knowledgeable and experienced man, 35
                    years now as foreign minister, father was the late king, King Faisal. He's heard
                    it all before. His response is, “We'll do it at our own pace and in accordance
                    with our own traditions and laws.” I think this is how they view it. We have no
                    leverage over them. I think this is something that few Americans appreciate. If
                    anything, it's the other way around. Constructing a policy that will promote
                    change in Saudi Arabia is little more than exhortation and appealing to their
                    own sense of what's in their best interest. They have to be persuaded that it is
                    in their own interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a chance to sit around with the younger
                        princes and have the equivalent of bull sessions, talking about wouldn't it
                        be nice to do this or that? You'd find most subscribe to the “we've got it
                        pretty good, it works well for us” line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, you know, it's a good question to raise because having contact
                    with ordinary Saudis, not to mention princes, is a lot more challenging that you
                    might think offhand. Even assuming that there isn't a language issue, there's a
                    basic difference of hours of the day. You've lived in Saudi Arabia, you know.
                    They entertain each other until four, five in the morning and they'll sit around
                    a tent or someone's tent and talk all night. You can do that two, three, four
                    times, maybe, but you can't be there every night. You're looking at your watch
                    and you know you have to be at the office at eight o'clock and earlier. You can
                    say that jokingly but it is a big issue, it's a big issue. The other interesting
                    aspect of this is that it's harder to meet Saudis than you might think, if only
                    because so much of the actual work is done by foreigners. When I've been in
                    other countries you encounter the local nationals at different levels of society
                    because you can come in direct contact with them just by stepping out of your
                    embassy or stepping out of your house and just by socializing.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>In Saudi Arabia, for example, we have a very large U.S. business community. When
                    I was there we had 40,000 to 45,000 Americans resident in the kingdom, about
                    evenly divided between Dhahran, Riyadh and Jeddah. I'd say 10,000 to 12,000 to
                    15,000, including dependents, in each of these three cities. You had many
                    American companies who had business interests in Saudi Arabia. Just like the
                    military would send its top officers out there on a constant basis, so would
                    major firms, corporations, send senior representatives to Saudi Arabia. In any
                    other country, they would host functions to which they would have their own
                    local employees organize guest lists and extend invitations, at local hotels or
                    whatever. In Saudi Arabia, the ambassador's residence became the venue for that
                    kind of entertaining. Quincy House was in constant, unceasing use as a venue for
                    business representational events because it was the only way in which the Saudis
                    would respond, having to get permission, in many cases, especially if they were
                    government officials, coming if the invitation was issued in the name of the
                    ambassador. The ambassador might or might not be present or he might be present
                    only for a few minutes but otherwise, if they were to host them at hotels, no
                    one would come. Other foreigners would come. Of course, one of the attractions,
                    I'll be candid, is that the ambassador could serve alcoholic beverages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was there, it was forbidden. We would serve it but
                        only if all the guests were foreigners, were non-Saudis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I'm not sure how much more liberal things have become but one of
                    the drawing cards for Saudis to accept that kind of invitation was that they
                    could get a drink there without the religious police looking over their
                    shoulder. Now the corporation, the business host, would pay all expenses
                    connected with and the ambassador could include whomever he liked. In fact the
                    companies encouraged you to bring other guests, and in fact many of our embassy
                    officers would come because that was their way of meeting these people as well.
                    It was not easy to achieve otherwise. You'd go to diplomatic receptions,
                    national day and the like and the only Saudis who would be there would be a
                    handful of business people and a few designated representatives from the foreign
                    ministry. No one else would come. Not that they weren't invited. No one else
                    would come. And they almost never invited you to their homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that they needed permission or they didn't feel
                        comfortable or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, it may have been a combination. For government officials, they
                    needed permission from the foreign ministry. If you had a Treasury official and
                    he was working during the day with, for example, his counterparts, the latter
                    might come. As we had several missions come to talk about WTO matters or other
                    economic issues, these receptions were a good way for our economic officers to
                    meet Saudis at the policy-making or operational level.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World Trade Organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: World Trade Organization. Or we would have American officials come to
                    advance our anti-terrorism cooperation, for example from the office in Treasury
                    that tracks the movement of foreign funds. Well, you could invite Saudis in the
                    evening and they might come but they would have been cleared to hold the
                    meetings in the first place by the foreign ministry and therefore would have
                    implicit permission or maybe explicit permission to attend a related social
                    event. But our public affairs section seeking to reach out to students or
                    professors or journalists or others like that, opinion leaders, encountered
                    enormous difficulty, enormous difficulty. To illustrate: where I've worked in
                    other countries, you would have a very large local country work force working in
                    the mission, typically outnumbering the Americans by a wide margin. When I was
                    in India, if you were not American, you were Indian. Every section had its
                    professionals; the AID mission was very heavily dependent on Indians, right down
                    to the gardeners. Saudi Arabia was a very big mission, a Class IV mission. I was
                    DCM, so I knew the situation very well. Do you know how many Saudis we had
                    working at the embassy? One. And he was the son of a Frenchman. Now, he was very
                    helpful to us. He was in the political section and he knew an enormous number of
                    people. His father had been physician to King Abdul Aziz, had married a Lebanese
                    lady, become a Muslim and all of that. But he wasn't a “real” Saudi. But we had
                    one. The hundreds of others were all from other countries. So it's easier said
                    than done, much easier said than done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been any terrorist attacks that began to zero
                        in. You mentioned Khobar Towers but that was maybe off to one side. But what
                        else had happened while you were there that gave focus on terrorism and
                        maybe look a little harder at Saudi Arabia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, of course it was the attacks in East Africa, on the embassies in
                    Dar es Salaam and Nairobi and if I recall there was one other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the underground garage underground garage
                        attack on the Twin Towers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: That was in '93, that was before my time in Riyadh. That was an
                    Egyptian, rather than a Saudi, the Blind Sheik. After the East African attacks
                    bin Laden became the overwhelming priority for us. As I said earlier, we had
                    been highly sensitized by the attack on Khobar Towers. We had had the first
                    attack, where five people were killed, which had not been connected to the
                    Iranians but seemed to be indigenously Saudi. We had had statements, if I recall
                    the timeline correctly, by bin Laden even before the attacks in which he heavily
                    criticized the Saudi royal family. There was a climate of tremendous
                    apprehension about terrorism. The focal point for us was, in addition to further
                    strengthening, further tightening our own defensive measures, the focal point
                    was to bring the Saudis to put pressure on the Taliban government in Afghanistan
                    to clamp down on bin Laden. That was the subject of numerous discussions at all
                    levels, including the vice president, who visited and by others as well, other
                    senior administration officials. Including Secretary Albright who came a number
                    of times during my time, four or five times to Saudi Arabia. As I mentioned, the
                    Secretary of Defense, Secretary Cohen in particular, was a regular visitor, the
                    JCS, and all of them, they were all singing from the same sheet of music, so to
                    speak. The Saudis were, I would say again, slow to come around on that. They had
                    good ties with the Afghan resistance. They had been, along with us, a major
                    supporter during the 1980's. They were not anxious to roil Islamic waters, if
                    you will. They professed not to have any real connections with the Taliban, that
                    their influence was very limited. But on the other hand, after a lot of
                    jawboning Prince Turki, the director of intelligence, GID and the brother of the
                    foreign minister, now ambassador in Britain, did travel at least once if not
                    twice to Kabul, where he apparently had no success at all. But this was a
                    continuing issue for us, tightening up on the flow of foreign funds. That had
                    started even earlier during the Bosnian War when we had received reports that
                    some Islamic extremists were at work in Bosnia and that there was Saudi money
                    going to those organizations. It was a very high priority for us, a very high
                    priority for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a media you could pay any attention to there? In
                        other words, was there, I won't say a lively press or TV or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, it was very much under control. We did have reporting on sermons.
                    We had a Muslim officer who, in Jeddah in particular, attended Friday prayer
                    services. He would report on the content, the themes, of these sermons. Even
                    there, just as the press and the electronic media were under very tight
                    government control, so, too, were the mosques. The ministry of religious affairs
                    controlled mosques and the appointment of imams to the mosques. You did not have
                    the phenomenon you have in other Arab countries like Egypt to some extent, or
                    even Jordan, where you have the mosque as an alternative source of assistance
                    and aid to people in trouble and allowed to operate that way. That's not the
                    case in Saudi Arabia. They had their own informants in the congregations who
                    would make sure that the preacher was sticking to the subject and, if I'm not
                    mistaken, the themes they were supposed to talk about in the Friday sermon were
                    disseminated by the ministry of religious affairs. So they were very concerned
                    about this. They had seen, as I mentioned to you before, these clerics from
                    Qassim who had tried to organize a movement critical of the royal family on
                    religious grounds.</p>
                <p>We also had a concern with the Saudi Afghans, if I can use that term. That is,
                    Saudis who had fought in the Afghan War with the mujahideen in the 1980's and
                    who had come back and were imbued with a very zealous view of Islam and
                    receptive to the notion that the royal family was violating its trust by
                    allowing these “Crusader forces,” the Americans, into the kingdom. This was the
                    real issue for them. This offended large numbers of very conservative Muslims.
                    We recognized that, particularly after these attacks and we tried to maintain
                    our military presence at as low a profile as possible. And recognizing that we
                    could not sustain this indefinitely, we began building up an alternative
                    facility to Prince Sultan Air Base, an alternative facility in Qatar. It's
                    interesting to note that after 9/11, in spite of the large amount of money that
                    was invested by the Saudis who paid ninety per cent of the cost of Prince Sultan
                    Air Base with tremendous data processing capabilities and all of that in the
                    service of Operation Southern Watch over Iraq, that we were prepared to walk
                    away from it and transfer this function to Qatar. And the Saudis, I am
                    confident, were happy to see us go. So that today and now for the last several
                    years, I think we're back down to our original military missions, the training
                    missions which have been there for almost half a century. Which, by the way,
                    were never a point of criticism. That was not an issue within Saudi Arabia,
                    because there they could see this was being done to build up their own
                    capabilities. Operation Southern Watch offended these fundamentalists, because
                    it was seen as a means of putting pressure on another Muslim country and the
                    royal family was complicit in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we basically ran our war in Iraq out of Qatar, weren't
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yeah, out of Qatar, the war in 2003. But prior to that, Operation
                    Southern Watch, was operated essentially out of Saudi Arabia, at least the air
                    force part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should talk about on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: On Saudi Arabia? There's lots I could talk about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 2000</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: In 2000, in '98, when my assignment as political counselor ended,
                    Ambassador Fowler was very keen to have continuity, to follow up on Ted Kattouf,
                    who later became ambassador to UAE and Syria, who had been DCM the first year or
                    two of the ambassador's presence in Saudi Arabia. Ted and others suggested that
                    since I had already been DCM elsewhere, that I would be a good candidate to
                    succeed him. So I stayed on for an additional two years, from 1998 to 2000,
                    making a total of five years in Saudi Arabia. In 2000, at the end of two years,
                    the opening in India developed, which I had bid on earlier. With the
                    ambassador's support, knowing how interested I was, he said, “I don't want to
                    hold you back. You've been in-country five years now. So why don't you pursue
                    this if you can get it.” Otherwise I would have stayed for a third year as
                    DCM.</p>
                <p>There is one other issue. I raise it only because it's been a very large element
                    in the 9/11 Commission's assessment of what happened, assessing the fact that 15
                    of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, all of whom had received a visa. That's on the
                    consular operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, what was the attitude towards visas
                        and getting young Saudis to the United States in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: The attitude towards visas in Saudi Arabia was reflective of what I
                    would call the general philosophy of overall consular operations as I have
                    encountered them in my assignments. Which is that until 9/11, by and large and I
                    won't say that this applies to every country but by and large, the view was that
                    visa applicants should be screened and an assessment made about their
                    eligibility based on their intentions, so far as these could be discerned, aided
                    by a review of the applicant's family, financial, academic, etc. standing. If
                    the general pattern in a particular country indicated a very low probability
                    that the visa applicant would remain in the United States, then the approach was
                    more liberal than in a country where there was a good probability of visa
                    applicants remaining in the United States and therefore perhaps making
                    fraudulent statements in order to qualify for the visa. Of course, the consular
                    officer's number one question up until this period, up until 9/11, was, is this
                    person an intending immigrant. As I've mentioned before, in Pakistan and in
                    India, where the criteria, particularly in the early Eighties and mid-Eighties,
                    when I was in those countries, were rather stringent, you had a relatively high
                    visa denial rate. Beyond the general question of intention, there was particular
                    focus on age groups and young, single men, in particular, were deemed in those
                    countries, India and Pakistan in the early Eighties, mid-Eighties, to be high
                    probability intending immigrants. So therefore the rate of visa issuance was
                    much lower than would have been the case in Germany or Sweden or Japan or many
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>Now these factors changed, particularly as the economic prospects improved and
                    particularly as we became more sophisticated in distinguishing between those who
                    had a legitimate reason to go to the United States, especially for studies, from
                    those who were there as “tourists.” In Nepal, as I've mentioned earlier, before,
                    although economic prospects were not so great in Nepal for young Nepalese, INS
                    data suggested that very few Nepalese remained in the United States when they
                    traveled there. So therefore the visa issuance rate, for young men for example,
                    was much higher in Nepal than it would have been in India, simply because we
                    were confident that when they told us why they were going there, the reason they
                    cited was appropriate and legitimate, and that they would return.</p>
                <p>Now, viewed in that context, Saudi Arabia was seen as a country in which very few
                    Saudis traveling to the United States remained in the U.S. after their travel.
                    INS data suggested that it was minuscule, in the less than one per cent
                    category. So, not surprisingly, there was a much more open attitude towards
                    issuing visas to Saudi applicants. That said, they had to apply for visas. There
                    were no waivers of the appearance and personal interview requirement simply
                    because they were Saudi citizens. The Visa Express program that attracted a
                    great deal of critical attention from the 9/11 Commission was not put in place
                    while I was there. So every day there would be a long lineup of Saudis outside
                    the consular sections at the consulates in Jeddah and Dhahran as well as in
                    Riyadh, of people applying for visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>The other dimension to our visa issuing policy and practice which was perhaps
                    unique to Saudi Arabia but very important in influencing the attitude of
                    consular officers in this pre-9/11 period was the fact that a very substantial
                    percentage of the Saudi population were non-Saudis. I've mentioned thirty to
                    forty per cent and in the work force much higher than that. So you had millions,
                    literally, of non-Saudi citizens living in Saudi Arabia with absolutely no
                    prospect of ever getting Saudi citizenship or remaining permanently in Saudi
                    Arabia, many of them highly educated, very well qualified in many different
                    fields, proficient in English because that's how they qualified to get into
                    Saudi Arabia in the first place. And therefore there was a reasonable
                    presumption, it seemed to us, that many of these people who would apply would be
                    perhaps intending immigrants. So there was particular scrutiny given to these
                    people. They were a very large percentage, I might add, of visa applicants.</p>
                <p>So the result of this is that for many years the pattern had been that Saudi
                    citizens were issued visas on a fairly liberal basis whereas non-Saudis faced a
                    rather steep barrier. Many of the latter, if they were older and they had
                    established ties, particularly if they had been to the United States and
                    returned, then of course that was a different matter. But for young people and
                    particularly young men, they really had, there was a high presumption that they
                    were intending immigrants. So this is how the section operated, by and large,
                    during the years that I was there and, as DCM, I interacted regularly and
                    closely with the Consul General who headed consular operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is anybody looking at, was the subject of potential
                        terrorists raised at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBUALT: Well, of course we had our Visa Viper list and there were names on the
                    lookout and each name had to be entered into the lookout system, which was tied
                    in to a worldwide database, global database, before a visa could be issued to
                    that person. I don't want to suggest that we bypassed those procedures. That was
                    not at all the case. If for some reason someone's name popped up on that list,
                    then obviously they would not be issued a visa. But it was in that context, not
                    necessarily that Saudi citizens per se, as opposed to Egyptians or Tanzanians or
                    whatever other nationality, might represent a higher level of terrorist threat
                    than those nationalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just had a flashback as you were talking. Much was made
                        of the fact that what were these young men doing going to flying school in
                        the United States. I was issuing visas in Dhahran in the late 1950's and I
                        was surprised at the number of Jordanians who were working in the Eastern
                        Province were applying to flying schools, mostly as I recall in Texas or
                        Oklahoma. Flying schools seemed to have quite an attraction to the young
                        people there. It struck me at the time, I thought, “Gee, I didn't know there
                        were that many airplanes.” There was already a long pattern of doing this.
                        We're talking about almost fifty years before.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, ironically, in the time that I was there one of the issues that
                    we discussed often and in fact bemoaned was the sharp drop in the number of
                    Saudi students going to the United States. The contrast between the Sixties,
                    Seventies and Eighties, when Saudis were number three or number four as a
                    nationality among foreign students in the U.S., in which you would have at any
                    given time then 20,000 to 25,000 Saudis studying in the United States with the
                    period in which I was there in the kingdom of maybe 3,000 to 4,000 Saudi
                    students. This was something that we regretted because we felt that the new
                    generation of Saudis and their leaders in the future would less reflect American
                    influence than more senior Saudis. We could see this in the ironic fact that
                    your older generation, middle-aged generation, was a lot more liberal and modern
                    and global in its outlook that the younger people. You would not expect that.
                    This reflected the fact that most Saudis, and they do have universal literacy
                    and free education and so forth, most Saudi university students attended Saudi
                    universities. It was a very different environment than what their fathers or
                    uncles had experienced. Then you had very specialized kinds of education like
                    flying or others which would not necessarily involve a degree but which provided
                    a kind of training that wasn't available in the kingdom and there was no reason,
                    as we saw it at the time, to be mindful or doubtful about their bona fides.</p>
                <p>I think another factor to keep in mind here was that Saudis paid their own way.
                    They were not there on scholarship. You did not have this sense that they would
                    be going in and looking for employment, unlawful employment, to support
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the universities of course were delighted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: They were delighted. Those who attended, there were many graduate
                    students. Those who attended, the three or four thousand, either went there
                    because their parents would have paid for it, as opposed to the government which
                    paid for it or they were graduate students, post-graduate students, where the
                    government did continue to pay because that kind of specialized training wasn't
                    available in the kingdom. So I think this pattern, the background provides a
                    context for the approach that the mission pursued and applied, in so far as
                    issuing visas was concerned. This was very much in sync with Department-wide
                    policy and with the policy of the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Now, of course,
                    all of this came to a great change. Now I understand, and I have no first hand
                    knowledge, that after my departure, which was in July of 2000 and then the year
                    between that time and 9/11, there was a significant change in how the consular
                    section operated. But, again, to put that in context, as I understand it, the
                    changes that were made and particularly this so-called Visa Express program,
                    were to try to get a handle on the huge numbers of people who were applying. As
                    I said before, you had these long lineups.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>And let me just mention that in addition to training, you had many, many, many,
                    many Saudis who traveled there for personal reasons. There were direct flights
                    between Jeddah and Orlando. So families would go on holiday. Many Saudis,
                    wealthier ones, have properties, they would spend time in the United States. So
                    for all of these, as I said, there was no waiver, they had to wait in line and
                    wait like anyone else. So this was an attempt, this Visa Express program,
                    presumably, was an attempt to sort of modernize that system and step up the flow
                    of processing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 2000.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I left in July, 2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, after a short leave I proceeded directly to New Delhi, India as
                    DCM there as well. I had been DCM in Riyadh. I mentioned that my tour had just
                    been extended to a third year as DCM, for a total of six. I had to seek special
                    approval of a sixth year in country, because of the Department's policy of a
                    maximum of five years. That had come through and then was in place and I was to
                    spend that additional year and in fact I was told informally then that I'd
                    probably become chief of mission in a neighboring Gulf country. I talked with
                    the Department on that. Then when the assignment of the person who was to go as
                    DCM to Delhi fell through, a complicated process, my name popped up because I
                    had earlier bid on the job, a year or two before and of course I had extensive
                    experience in the region. The ambassador there, Governor Dick Celeste, was keen
                    to have someone who was knowledgeable about the country and had previous
                    management experience. So he was keen to have me. Ambassador Fowler in Delhi
                    knew how much an assignment to India meant to me. So the Department in
                    Washington and others made it happen. I had said I was prepared to go but I've
                    made a commitment to spend an additional year in Riyadh. If this is what the
                    Department wants me to do, I will do it but I will not lobby to do it, to go
                    there, because it did place the bureau, the NEA bureau, in a difficult position
                    in May and June to find a DCM for Riyadh, which is an important post. I said,
                    “If you want to make it happen, fine but I will not become actively engaged. I'm
                    quite happy to remain where I am.”</p>
                <p>But in fact I did go to Delhi. I was there for three years. The first year as DCM
                    for Ambassador Dick Celeste and then the last two years for Ambassador Bob
                    Blackwill, so for a total of three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you got there in 2000. How would you describe the
                        state of relations between India and the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, they were on an upturn and Ambassador Celeste deserves a great
                    deal of credit for this because as recently as 1998 the Indians had exploded a
                    nuclear device which caught the U.S. government with its proverbial pants down.
                    The intelligence community was completely buffaloed by this development. They
                    had not expected it. The Indians had played the positioning of our satellites
                    that observed their test site and did a lot of preparation at night. In other
                    words, operated in a way that concealed those preparations from our
                    surveillance. I say this is nothing classified. This is well known. So it came
                    as a great shock and of course was seen by the administration, the Clinton
                    Administration, as a real slap in the face, particularly as they thought they
                    had been assured by the new government led by Prime Minister Vajpayee that the
                    government of India had no intention of exploding a device but yet it happened.
                    So this was in 1998. Within two years President Clinton had made a state visit
                    to India, a five day state visit, which was extremely successful. And a
                    presidential visit, especially to a developing country, does not happen often or
                    overnight.</p>
                <p>As I said, the credit for the visit and for really doggedly influencing attitudes
                    both in Delhi and in Washington, goes to Ambassador Celeste, who's a remarkable
                    man, a three time governor of Ohio and former director of the Peace Corps. After
                    college, he had spent three years as special assistant to Ambassador Chester
                    Bowles, who's one of the icons of the U.S.-Indian historical relationship, in
                    the late Sixties. He developed a love of India which has lasted to this day. I
                    might note, just to round out his biographical picture, that he's presently the
                    president of Colorado College in Colorado Springs. He obviously worked hard to
                    persuade the Administration, or maybe he didn't work so hard, I don't know, to
                    be appointed as ambassador to India but he was a wonderful choice, a man who has
                    a great sense of policy and is an enormously likeable, outgoing person, a great
                    manager for the embassy and an Ambassador who made it his mission to overcome
                    the tremendous trough in the bilateral relationship. As I say, it was capped by
                    a presidential visit, which occurred in March and I arrived in August.</p>
                <p>So relations were on an upswing and as a result of that visit there was, of
                    course, follow -up action and I was caught in that immediately because, within a
                    day of my arrival in August, the ambassador went on leave and so I was caught up
                    in preparations for the prime minister's visit to Washington, which occurred in
                    the fall of 2000. We had a number of senior level visitors, coming and going in
                    both directions, an enormous amount of preparation that the U.S. government,
                    including the mission in India, was engaged in. So it was a good thing that I
                    had some familiarity and awareness of India and had a background in it because
                    it would have been much more difficult. So I got off on a very active and
                    positive note and the prime minister's visit went extremely well. Very important
                    to this process was the continuity that developed.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>I say this because while we in New Delhi were in the throes of getting ready for
                    the PM's visit and basking in the after-effects of the Clinton visit, at home we
                    were in the final throes of the presidential campaign and of course President
                    Bush was elected to his first term in the fall of 2000 and took office in
                    January of 2001. The statements that candidate Bush had made on foreign policy,
                    for the first time ever in a presidential campaign, included very positive
                    references to India. Historically, most presidential candidates had simply
                    ignored India or would make a passing mention of it with a number of other
                    countries but in several statements Governor Bush particularly emphasized the
                    commitment he was making and the importance he would place on building a new
                    relationship with India. This caught a lot of people's attention in India and,
                    as I say, it was very unusual. It meant that there was confidence as we
                    proceeded with the transition into the first few months of the administration
                    that the relationship would continue on a high note and that is, in fact,
                    exactly what happened.</p>
                <p>The credit for this, once again, comes down to personalities as much of the
                    reason for this very positive approach by the new administration belonged to my
                    second ambassador in Delhi, who was Ambassador Bob Blackwill. He had been a
                    foreign policy advisor to Governor Bush as a candidate and would come down from
                    Harvard, where he was a professor at the Kennedy School, to spend several days a
                    week with Governor Bush traveling around the country. He drafted several of
                    Bush's campaign speeches on foreign affairs or had an important hand in them and
                    persuaded him that the time was ripe to make India a centerpiece of his approach
                    to foreign policy. And, after the election, he was nominated to be ambassador to
                    India. As I say, it made for very smooth continuity of policy and immediate
                    engagement on the part of Indians, a predisposition on their part, the Vajpayee
                    government, to further develop the good relationship with the United States. In
                    other words, they worked hard to avoid poking their finger in our eye and to
                    consider seriously new policy initiatives from the Bush Administration. And that
                    is what happened.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Celeste remained in Delhi through April of 2001 and I was charg�
                    thereafter for several months 'til Ambassador Blackwill was confirmed and able
                    to come out to New Delhi. But in that period of time, the administration, and
                    again we're talking about the pre-9/11 period, May 2001, the administration
                    unveiled new ideas about missile defense to which the Indians were among the
                    very few countries to respond positively. This came as a great surprise to
                    Washington, a very pleasant surprise for an important country like India to make
                    positive statements like this at a time when there was so much criticism at home
                    and abroad, especially from a country whose stereotype was that it would
                    distance itself consciously from the U.S. While awaiting confirmation, the
                    ambassador-designate, Bob Blackwill, spoke about the desire of the
                    administration for a “transformation” of the bilateral relationship. This became
                    a phrase, a mantra, that was his hallmark for the entire period during which I
                    worked with him and in which he was ambassador. So it was a good experience to
                    have that policy continuity.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: I had been, I had left India in 1983. I passed through several times
                    when in Nepal but had not spent any period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, was there a new generation of Indian
                        bureaucrats or maybe Indian thinking in universities? Was this really a new
                        India in thought or</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It was a new India and I was astounded. It had been 17 years since I'd
                    been there. Recall that I first went to India in 1968, so I've had 30 years of
                    exposure to the country. It was an astounding, unbelievably different country.
                    New Delhi alone, as a city, was far more vibrant and prosperous and interesting
                    than I had recalled it. Attitudes, as you rightly suggest, were the key change.
                    Attitude towards the U.S., I won't say Americans because Americans never had any
                    problem in interacting with Indians, but with the U.S. as a sort of a concept.
                    It was like night and day. You recall that when I was there in the early
                    Eighties, our political counselor designate was blackballed by the Indian
                    government because of the communist influence. The fall of the Soviet Union, the
                    disappearance of the communist media which they were subsidizing were two
                    factors. Much more important was the turnaround in their economy when they
                    abandoned their socialist model of economic growth. And the emergence of a new
                    generation across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was mostly socialist and internalized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Yeah, it was a self-sufficient model, yeah. I mean, not entirely. We
                    say socialist. The state was to be the guiding hand, so to speak but there was a
                    very substantial private sector, don't get me wrong, but that was the Nehru
                    philosophy. It had been sanctified by being associated with Nehru and his
                    daughter, Mrs. Gandhi, continued with it. It began to change under Rajiv Gandhi,
                    Mrs. Gandhi's son who himself was of the new generation. He was only forty when
                    he became prime minister and then was tragically assassinated. Then a near
                    economic collapse in 1991 and 1992 forced them to revise their policy and their
                    overall thinking. The innate entrepreneurial talents and spirit of the Indian
                    business community and of Indians generally immediately manifested themselves.
                    They began to achieve a growth rate of six, seven, eight, nine per cent per year
                    for many years, which continues to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>A younger generation - we could see this particularly in the bureaucracy. I had
                    previously functioned as a domestic political officer. I dealt mostly with
                    politicians and not so much with the bureaucracy in the early Eighties when I'd
                    been there. But I certainly heard plenty about their attitude, the difficulty of
                    working with them. They were proverbial, not just for those who had to deal with
                    them but even globally. This time I was working with them on a day to day basis,
                    across many ministries at pretty senior levels but working levels. They got the
                    message, so to speak, that the government leadership wanted a positive
                    relationship with the United States and they understood that they had to make it
                    happen. And I developed some very good and close friendships with Indian
                    officials in the foreign ministry and in other ministries as well. Throughout
                    the three years I was there, I would be in their offices daily and we would also
                    see them on a social basis as well.</p>
                <p>So it was a totally different environment. Finally India had found its place in
                    the global economy, particularly with its high tech capability. This was very
                    important because, first of all, it meant a close relationship with the United
                    States, which was the fountainhead of their technology, which was built on very
                    close ties with many American companies, on the many Indians educated and
                    working in the United States, some of whom came back and interacted in India.
                    But secondly as a source of pride to the nation, overcoming this image of
                    Calcutta and Mother Teresa and poverty-stricken India which was so prevalent in
                    the Sixties and Seventies. The Indians had had a chip on their shoulder which
                    represented a defensive attitude, almost an inferiority complex. The younger
                    generation had none of that. Not that they were overbearing or moved to the
                    other side of the spectrum. You could just deal with them on their own terms and
                    on a positive and productive basis in which they were not counting their fingers
                    after shaking your hand or second guessing what your real motives were. And then
                    thirdly, that sector had grown up free of government control because it fell
                    between the cracks. It was so new, the technology was so new it didn't fit
                    within the usual footprints of government ministries. People drew a powerful
                    lesson from this. It had grown because the government ignored it, and then it
                    grew so rapidly and to such a size that if government tried to intervene there
                    would be a tremendous pushback.</p>
                <p>The attitude of the private sector, which had been very obsequious and very
                    deferential to government, had completely reversed. They functioned as a modern
                    interest group does here in the United States, attempting to inform the
                    legislative process to their benefit, both at the individual corporate level and
                    in associations as well. That was very important.</p>
                <p>The fact that tens of thousands and maybe millions, today, of young, well
                    educated English-speaking Indians can find good job opportunities in their own
                    country, without having to emigrate, itself was a source of strength and pride
                    as well and of self-satisfaction. So, yes, everything had changed, everything
                    had changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations, in a way our military to military
                        relations were good even during the bad times, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, you know that had always been a source of misgiving and complaint
                    on the part of the Indians, that we always tilted towards Pakistan and that the
                    U.S military instinctively felt more comfortable working with the Pakistanis.
                    Indeed, the Pakistanis had been members of CENTO, which was the Central Treaty
                    Organization, which existed in the Fifties and Sixties. They had allowed U.S.
                    bases in Peshawar. The U-2 was based there. Then of course during the Afghan war
                    we provided ... there was a turnaround in our attitude towards providing
                    military equipment, F-16's, to Pakistan. The Indians, on the other hand, had a
                    privileged relationship, including arms supply relationship, with the Soviet
                    Union. All of that was part of the background, and the result was that the
                    Pentagon, in particular, had no particular fondness for India. The mil-mil
                    relationship was a very thin one. That began to change. This really began taking
                    off under the Bush Administration and was particularly propelled by the
                    intellectual and bureaucratic energy that was provided by Ambassador
                    Blackwill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit about Blackwill. I never interviewed anyone who
                        served with him but the papers seem to allude to his managerial style and
                        not in particularly glowing terms but I know nothing about it. Could you
                        comment on working with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: He is without doubt the smartest and most brilliant, that's the word I
                    would use, person I've every worked with or for. Bob has a penetrating intellect
                    which is applied to public policy issues. He is a student of diplomacy in the
                    old fashioned sense of the word. On the coffee table in his office in Delhi he
                    had various books by Kissinger which he almost knew by heart and would often
                    quote verbatim, books full of pithy insight on the diplomatic-cum-bureaucratic
                    and policy-making process. He is an acolyte of Henry Kissinger, was a key aide
                    to him in the 70's, and has remained on very, very close terms with him. He sees
                    himself as a Kissingerian, as do others as well. He was intimately involved with
                    the evolution of U.S. policy towards the collapse of the Soviet Union, towards
                    the reunification of Germany, was decorated by the German government for his
                    role as a key aide to Secretary Baker. He often described himself as a Harvard
                    don in his speeches in India, recognizing that there academic eminence trumped
                    diplomatic background (a la Galbraith whom he also knew), but, in fact, for
                    almost 25 years he was an FSO, rose to the rank of ambassador to the MBFR in
                    Vienna. And during that time he was also political counselor in Tel Aviv at the
                    time of the Camp David negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>He has a phenomenal range of personal friendships and contacts both in Washington
                    and throughout the Western Alliance. I say phenomenal and I mean that. He is
                    policy oriented to his fingertips and I say that in the most positive way
                    possible because for him it is not enough to have an analytical or intellectual
                    understanding of an issue and of a possible course of action. The question he
                    will instantly pose is very specifically, operationally, how do you affect and
                    influence and change policy to achieve your desired objective. His understanding
                    of how bureaucracy, our bureaucracy, works in Washington, the relationship of
                    the National Security Council to the Defense Department, to the State
                    Department, to the intelligence agencies and to other players is second to none,
                    second to none. He enlisted his forceful personality and boundless energy to
                    challenge, overcome, and shape ingrained positions about India generally, the
                    accumulation of 40 years of dealing with a difficult country, and in particular,
                    the orthodoxies of the non-proliferation theologians, but in other areas as
                    well. He relished that. Quite simply, he is a remarkable man.</p>
                <p>His association with President Bush as a campaign advisor, the fact that he had
                    been Condi Rice's boss in the NSC in the late Eighties when Scowcroft was
                    national security advisor, where he worked with Colin Powell, with all kinds of
                    people whose names today are front and center in our own policy environment
                    means that he knows everyone in the current administration. He knows how their
                    minds work. He knows how they can be moved. He knows where they can't be moved.
                    He knows how to get others to move them. He is a brilliant, brilliant
                    person.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, he has an energy level that I have never encountered before in
                    anyone. He is a person who sleeps maybe three or four hours a day and has for
                    many years. He gets up at about four o'clock in the morning and then immediately
                    logs on and then just goes through a bunch of papers, both U.S. and foreign,
                    overseas. By six he's ready to go. He's a Force of Nature, no question about it,
                    no question about it.</p>
                <p>Now you asked about his managerial style. He's extremely demanding; he just is.
                    His standards are extremely high. He's always thinking ahead. He's a great
                    communicator. Nothing is secretive with Bob Blackwill. You know what he's
                    looking for, what his approach is, what his analysis is, what his objectives
                    are, and it's constant, that way. He expects people to understand what the goal
                    is and to support him in achieving that. Now, this goes down well with some and
                    not so well with others. He can be very, he works 24/7. His expectation is that
                    those who work with him will not necessarily share the same intensity of
                    purpose, he understands that he's unique in his ability to get by with as little
                    sleep, and that people have other things in their lives as well. That said, he
                    demands a very high level of commitment and engagement. So conventional hours
                    are not the norm, if you want to work with Bob; don't expect to do that. There's
                    no question that there were some who didn't cotton to this approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, as some DCM's are, standing between
                        this Force of Nature, as you put it and ordinary human beings who work
                        within the embassy, to keep them productive and not getting bruised?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Inevitably that's the case. That described my role, in effect.
                    Absolutely, yes. I was managing the mission. Bob's focus was on the policy and
                    the policy goals and the transformations that I mentioned before. This is not a
                    lightly used word in his lexicon. Transformation means moving ahead and moving
                    real change, not at the margins but substantive change, on difficult issues, on
                    a wide range of fronts. That was all-consuming for him, so the day to day
                    mission, if you will, was something that he expected me to take care of, while
                    at the same time providing him needed support. He was looking for his DCM to
                    achieve those goals. So it meant for me a very tough schedule, a grueling
                    schedule, throughout those two years that I worked with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, because of 9/11, I'm thinking about
                        Bangalore and others, these tech centers, was there concern on the embassy's
                        and the ambassador's part about that we were giving up too much to the
                        Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: No, quite the contrary. We saw this as a win- win situation for both
                    countries, as I continue to regard it as that. It added value to both sides,
                    keeping in mind that the U.S. government had very little to do with any of it.
                    These were corporate relationships that were established. The companies that
                    operated in India and who came to operate in India did not consult us except on
                    problems they might face and that was rare, didn't inform us. They were always
                    cordial if we went down there but these were relationships that they had built
                    and developed on their own. So whether we liked it or not was neither here nor
                    there. I am sure that is very much the case now. Now you might have your own
                    views as to where it might lead but at that time it was viewed as a very
                    positive step. I should add here that I think that, I've noticed in the last two
                    years, since I've come back and particularly in the last year that China and
                    India are often mentioned in the same breath as formidable players in the
                    evolving 21st century global economy and as you implied, over time, could pose
                    some kind of, if not threat, at least challenge to us. I can't comment about
                    China but I certainly think that's overblown with regard to India, at least for
                    a long time to come. I think I'm second to none in my admiration for and
                    affection for India but I also have, I believe, a clear understanding of their
                    limitations and there are very, very, very considerable limitations. Their
                    political process is complex and not conducive to clear-cut decisions. There are
                    very severe limitations on infrastructure and in areas other than this high tech
                    one that so much attention has focused on, which embraces really a very minute
                    percentage of the population. They have a long way to go to overcome them and
                    this is not easy to achieve, given their free wheeling and democratic political
                    process because a lot of difficult choices have to be made.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of the sheer size of the population. Well, how
                        about, during the time you were there, how stood things between India and
                        Pakistan in Kashmir and did we get involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Let me just talk about, I'll come back to Pakistan but let me just make
                    a comment, for the record here, on this transformation that we were talking
                    about. We spent an enormous amount of time trying to develop a relationship on
                    civil nuclear cooperation, on civil space cooperation, and on improving our
                    mil-mil ties. We achieved a lot of success in the latter, that is the mil-mil
                    relationship, and were less immediately successful in the first two, civil
                    nuclear and civil space, because of entrenched opposition here in Washington, in
                    the PM bureau in particular. Whether that's John Bolton or not, as some would
                    allege, I have no idea but we had great difficulty in that regard. And it was
                    not an issue that's easy to explain or where there are large constituencies
                    involved, where you could find allies to do that. So when I emphasized
                    Ambassador Blackwill's bureaucratic savvy, that doesn't mean he was successful
                    in all regards. Yet a great deal of effort was expended in those areas. However,
                    seen over the longer term, what Bob did achieve was to persuade most of official
                    Washington of the benefit to the U.S. of a relationship with India in the
                    emerging Asia of the 21st century, highlighting that trust could be established
                    on the basis of shared values and with a rock-solid democratic partner. I
                    believe we will yet see those agreements reached, especially on civil nuclear
                    cooperation. .</p>
                <p>The Pakistan relationship of course starts with Kashmir and that's been the case
                    now for fifty or more years. There was a lot of ferment in Kashmir itself. There
                    had been an insurgency that had continued for many years, beginning in the late
                    Eighties and starting in the early Nineties, that led to tens of thousands of
                    people being killed. The evidence was very clear that the source of this was in
                    Pakistan itself, in which militants would have refuge on the Pakistani side of
                    the Line of Control as it's called, on the Pakistani side in Kashmir and
                    elsewhere in Pakistan, and with direct encouragement by the government of
                    Pakistan, who would arm and equip them and then send them across the border to
                    conduct mayhem. The Indians found that very difficult to counter. Part of it was
                    because of some sympathy with the militants on the part of the Kashmiri
                    population but also because of the nature of the terrain, which is very rugged,
                    and then also because of the nature of the tactics that would be used to deal
                    with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>9/11 cast all of this in an entirely different light. Instead of talking about
                    militants and insurgents, we talked about terrorists. 9/11 did several things.
                    With the collapse of the Taliban and the attack on them and on al-Qaeda, of
                    course the Pakistani bases of support for al-Qaeda became a major concern for
                    the U.S. government. That in turn led to serious questions in Washington, which
                    continue to this day, about what is going on in Pakistani society, in which
                    fundamentalism has taken strong root and in which you have groups responsible
                    for the murder of Daniel Pearl of the Wall Street Journal, for several attacks
                    on President Musharraf attempting to assassinate him, an attack on an
                    international church in which a number of Americans were killed in Islamabad,
                    attacks on the U.S. consulate in Karachi, car bomb attacks, attacks on a group
                    of French engineers, ten of whom were killed in Karachi also, frequent and
                    deadly sectarian bombings. In other words, terrorism as a continuing phenomenon
                    around the country. Then you have these groups operating in Kashmir and it
                    became clear to us, at least viewed from the information we had in India, that
                    they were part of the sub-culture of terrorism entrenched in Pakistan which made
                    the use of terrorism an acceptable political tool. What was hard to accept was
                    that the intelligence agencies in Pakistan that were targeting domestic terror
                    groups and al-Qaeda, in response to U.S. pressure and in self-defense it has to
                    be admitted, were at the same time supporting the terrorist groups operating in
                    Kashmir, whom they typically equipped and trained. And the latter often had
                    close ties to the groups that the GOP claimed to be trying to suppress in
                    Pakistan itself that were such a danger to their internal order. The Islamic
                    justification against infidels which motivated a lot of these young men was
                    directed against India as much as against the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and other
                    countries. So, as I say, 9/11 really gave us a different kind of insights into
                    what was going on there.</p>
                <p>And it became a subject of increasing importance in the U.S.-India relationship.
                    If we're going to be talking about terrorists worldwide, the ambassador argued,
                    we should be pointing to the terrorists, Islamic terrorists, operating against
                    India. In December 2001 there was a suicide attack on the Indian parliament in
                    New Delhi. They came this close an inch apart an inch apart, my fingers, of
                    penetrating the door of the inner sanctum of the Indian parliament, the lower
                    house of parliament, and they intended to murder, to assassinate as many
                    parliamentarians as possible. There was a gun battle in which they were all
                    killed and a number of security, Indian security folks, were killed as well.
                    Instantly, in India and on the part of the government, the conviction sprang up
                    that these were Pakistani recruited, trained and supported terrorists. The
                    investigation, including examination of their mobile phone calls and whatever
                    documentation they found on them added to that conviction. The belief was that
                    the Pakistanis were determined to attack the very foundations of the Indian
                    state. The way the Indians would put it to us, was just imagine you had a
                    similar group trying to break into the U.S. Congress. Of course this did happen
                    in 1947, with a group of Puerto Rican nationalists. And therefore the reaction
                    was extremely strong.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>This came in the wake, too, of an earlier meeting between Prime Minister Vajpayee
                    and President Musharraf in Agra, prior to this attack, which had buoyed hopes of
                    a breakthrough in relations but which if anything led to a downturn. The meeting
                    was a total failure. So now you had the belief that the Pakistanis were really
                    out to get the Indian state, if you will. Events began moving very quickly after
                    that, after December 2001, through 2002, when there was a major buildup in
                    Kashmir of Indian military personnel, all kinds of movements along the
                    Indian-Pakistani border and growing signs the Indians might be prepared to
                    attack Pakistan. This generated enormous concern in Washington and in our
                    mission as well because, of course, you have both countries armed, having
                    nuclear weapons and a delivery capability. The Pakistanis have been testing
                    their missile delivery systems and the Indians have those capabilities too. It
                    was believed and feared that a nuclear exchange was a very, very real
                    possibility in that kind of climate.</p>
                <p>The Indians began making increasingly insistent demands that the Pakistanis cease
                    their support of the terrorist groups in Kashmir. This support and the climate
                    of violence in Kashmir is very cyclical, very seasonal. During the winter, given
                    the mountain terrain, there are heavy snows which cut off the passes that are
                    used by infiltrators and so there's a sharp falloff in terrorist incidents. But
                    then as the snows melt, beginning in May-June, the number begins to increase. So
                    you have what are relatively objective measures of terrorist activity and a
                    basis on which you can conclude that they are receiving support. The Indians, of
                    course, claimed and would share with us information that included radio
                    intercepts, the questioning of prisoners when they were traced and so forth to
                    indicate that the evidence against Pakistani backing was clear and
                    incontrovertible. So we watched, the whole U.S. government watched, this
                    situation developing with growing alarm. The ambassador was exceptionally
                    active. He's always active but if anything he was even more so.</p>
                <p>Let me emphasize that his relationships with the leadership of the Vajpayee
                    government were probably the closest that any ambassador has ever had, including
                    those of Galbraith with Nehru in the early 60's. Part of his strategic focus is
                    to identify and get to know well the people who count in government, meaning who
                    can have some influence on the policy you're trying to work on or work with. And
                    that others who fall outside that scope are not of much interest to you. Now,
                    some might say well, an ambassador should devote a lot of attention to promoting
                    commercial relationships, to cultural relationships, you name it. But that
                    ambassador was focused on transformation and in this particular instance of
                    crisis management the emphasis he had placed on cultivating key officials paid
                    big dividends. We would meet with the national security advisor of the prime
                    minister and senior officials involved in that policy almost on request, often
                    daily or near daily, it was that close. So they had a very clear eyed
                    understanding of Washington's views, of Washington's alarm, of our assessments,
                    and of our insistence that they restrain themselves and that they make sure that
                    there be no miscommunication or missignaling of their intentions. So this was a
                    major focus.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I should add as well that we worked extremely closely with the British on this.
                    In fact, Ambassador Blackwill's tenure was marked by the closest possible
                    relationship between the U.S. and the British missions. Washington and London
                    were like this and I link my fingers together here, in lockstep. So Powell and
                    Straw, Colin Powell and Jack Straw, were in direct communication on a frequent
                    basis. Of course the ambassador, who knew the national security advisor,
                    Condoleezza Rice, she had worked for him before, so they were in very frequent
                    contact as well.</p>
                <p>President Musharraf issued a statement that Pakistan was not supporting
                    terrorists and would not support terrorists. Of course we tried to make the most
                    of that statement with the Indians but they remained very suspicious and the way
                    in which they measured this was by what they saw on the ground in Kashmir. They
                    did not see these public statements translated into action on the ground. As the
                    military preparations gathered steam and particularly as weather conditions in
                    the late spring and early summer permitted military deployments more easily,
                    people were very much focused on the fact that three previous Indo-Pak wars had
                    been fought at that time of year. So things were coming to a head.</p>
                <p>The ambassador, and again for all the criticism that some people make about his
                    managerial style, was totally and absolutely and fundamentally focused on the
                    security of our people, not just members of the official community and the
                    mission but of American citizens in India. I want to emphasize that because we,
                    meaning he, devoted an enormous amount of thought and time and dialogue with
                    Washington on this issue and in ensuring that should war break out as few of our
                    people would be in harm's way as possible, and therefore there was a need to
                    make public statements alerting Americans to the grave danger that was building.
                    These events culminated in a recommendation to the Department that the embassy
                    be evacuated of all but essential personnel. This was the first time ever in the
                    U.S.-India relationship and it was accepted by Washington. It was implemented
                    within a few days, at the very end of May, coinciding, fortunately, with the end
                    of the school year so it was minimally disruptive in real terms and with the
                    normal transfer cycle as well. Within a few days all but a small number of
                    people had left. I had been allowed to go on leave for a few days and was in
                    South Carolina at the time and was called back by the ambassador, and I
                    immediately returned. So we oversaw that evacuation and the British and many
                    other embassies followed suit as well.</p>

                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: I think it was viewed cynically by some the Indian media but I think it
                    brought home to the government of India and to the Indian public just how
                    seriously we viewed this crisis. So we observed this through June and well into
                    July and we did begin seeing a tailing off of infiltration and finally the
                    Indians began calling units back. You can only maintain this level of forward
                    deployment and high alert for a limited period of time. So by August the
                    situation had become a little bit more relaxed. The Indians announced elections
                    in Kashmir which was something that Musharraf could use with his own people and
                    the crisis eased. We were able to lift the evacuation and our people were able
                    to come back within a relatively short period of time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the view from Delhi and our people that the
                        Pakistani intelligence service was a loose cannon? In other words, was that
                        under control of the president? To some extent, Pakistan was showing signs
                        of being a failed state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, I don't accept the notion of Pakistan as a failed state, as
                    someone who has spent some time there. I think our view was in fact the
                    intelligence agencies were not rogue agencies but were reflecting the policy and
                    the choices of the government of Pakistan, not necessarily in all of the
                    operational details but in terms of the basic posture and in terms of the basic
                    policy. The Pakistani Army is a very well-disciplined organization and always
                    has been, which is one of the reasons why it's intervened as frequently as it
                    has in domestic politics. So I don't think we accepted that notion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there, this attack, was it December of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: December of 2001.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back to another thing, we were focused on al-Qaeda
                        and the terrorists. Our president keeps reiterating, everything is terrorism
                        and it stems from one source. According to somebody I was just interviewing,
                        there was an attack in the Nineties on our airmen who were lodged in the
                        Khobar Towers and the operation was an Iranian operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Right, I was there at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about this but there seemed to be a, I think you
                        mentioned, there was an attempt to almost not overplay. This was taking our
                        focus away, this was another source of terrorism and we had another policy.
                        Was this coming up at all, because having Pakistani terrorists could dilute
                        that focus?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: There was a conundrum for the administration, no question about it. On
                    the one hand, we depended on the Pakistanis for their cooperation in going after
                    al-Qaeda and there were a number of spectacular arrests that were made of
                    al-Qaeda operatives, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, among others. Not to mention that in
                    building up the Karzai government and creating a more friendly state in
                    Afghanistan we needed Pakistani understanding and support for that as well,
                    given their ability to really make that goal much more difficult to achieve if
                    they weren't inclined to work with us. So our reporting and our very strongly
                    expressed views, as expressed by Ambassador Blackwill, were not always welcome
                    in Washington. He was extremely tough in his public remarks and he understood
                    very, very clearly that an essential dimension of what we were trying to achieve
                    in this transformation of the relationship was that it had to be publicly
                    explained. So he was constantly working with the media and always accessible for
                    interviews, for statements on television, seeking them out, giving public
                    speeches, writing op-ed pieces. This was a major element of his diplomatic
                    approach and style and he was pursued by the media wherever he traveled in the
                    country for his comments and he never shrank from that. So he would make very,
                    very forceful statements. As I said, one that comes to mind is, referring to
                    these people operating across the border from Pakistan, that these were not
                    “militants,” they were not “insurgents,” they were not “misguided youths,” he
                    would say, “Let us call them what they are. They are terrorists and they should
                    be treated like terrorists and the United States government is committed to
                    fighting terrorism and we apply that policy towards terrorism in Kashmir and
                    wherever it happens.”</p>
                <p>Well this was a line that was not always welcomed in Islamabad. The Pakistanis
                    viewed the people coming across the line of control as indigenous and the
                    insurgency in Kashmir as having an indigenous character. They would dress it up
                    in terms of people fighting for their freedom and “we support them, we
                    sympathize with them, we provide moral support but nothing more than that.” Of
                    course, that was baloney. So it would create problems for our embassy, for our
                    ambassador in Pakistan, because sometimes Blackwill's statements would be made
                    at a time of delicacy in our U.S.-Pak relationship and his remarks would be
                    highly publicized in Pakistan. As I say, it would create problems for us there.
                    But this was not something on which Bob would back down, nor was he ever told by
                    the Department or the White House to take a different line.</p>

                <p>THIBAULT: Let me just mention, in terms of 9/11, the day of 9/11, I very well
                    remember watching on CNN the attack going on, the place crashing into the
                    building, the towers and so forth. This was in the late afternoon, our time. As
                    that was occurring, the ambassador received a phone call from the foreign
                    minister, Jaswant Singh, in which he express the firmest and most positive
                    support for the United States, to any degree and at whatever level and whatever
                    way they could be helpful, they would be with us. And again, this was a very
                    uncompromising, very swift, very instinctive response on their part and highly
                    welcomed in Washington. There were no nuances to it, unlike some of the weasel
                    words we might have gotten a few years beforehand. It testified to this strong
                    relationship and this transformational process that was underway. This was all
                    put to the test on the issue of Iraq. When it became clear that the
                    administration was prepared to consider military action if Saddam Hussein did
                    not implement UN Security Council resolutions, the question then arose as to
                    where would the Indians be.</p>
                <p>This was not only a theoretical or hypothetical question but a real one after the
                    fighting war concluded followed by the occupation beginning in the spring of
                    2003. The administration was very keen on lining up as many other countries as
                    possible to join us, particularly with, as they say, boots on the ground. In
                    that regard we came very close to getting a large Indian contingent in Iraq. We
                    were in very intense dialogue with them. Secretary Rumsfeld himself came out to
                    Delhi, as did Gen. Shinseki, the Army Chief of Staff. The Indian defense
                    minister also traveled to Washington for talks on this issue. The Indian army
                    was institutionally disposed to dispatching up to a division, as I was well
                    aware, dealing personally with several of the senior generals. During the war,
                    at Blackwill's initiative, a mark of the new relationship as he put it, but with
                    full endorsement from Washington, I undertook a formal briefing of the Indians,
                    on a day by day basis, on military developments in Iraq, an unprecedented step
                    on our part, drawing from all sources, including classified ones, to give them a
                    sense of what was going on and to promote a serious dialogue between us. The
                    Defense Department was extremely keen to get that presence in Iraq because the
                    Indians, unlike some other nations, represent a serious fighting force. They've
                    had plenty of experience, they're well regarded, and they have large
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>The Indian army was quite ready to go, quite prepared. They had identified the
                    units that would be deployed and it seemed that it would happen. But as word of
                    the dialogue between the two governments began leaking to the media, there was a
                    counter reaction, particularly among the opposition parties and therefore in
                    Parliament, expressing reservations about this. Not about the bilateral
                    relationship but about this particular action and ultimately Prime Minister
                    Vajpayee decided that he could not manage it. This would have been a departure
                    from their previous fifty years of policy. He felt he could not break this kind
                    of new ground unless he had a consensus, a national consensus, behind him and he
                    finally opted out of it. It was a disappointment to us but we understood - this
                    was a political decision that he alone could make.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did some aspects of the Bush Administration, while you
                        were there, have repercussion with our relations with India? I'm thinking,
                        we've tended to repudiate treaties and go it alone. These are
                        oversimplifications but it was much more of a confrontational, almost
                        nationalistic type of policy than what we had under previous presidents, and
                        how did that translate because the Indians have always been great ones for
                        multilateral things and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I've been talking about transformation of bilateral relations but you
                    and I had earlier discussed the transformation of the India I had last
                    encountered almost twenty years earlier. Very little of the Bush
                    Administration's policies aroused a strong negative reaction on the part of the
                    Indians, very little. I think that an important reason was the fact that, to
                    some degree or another, they shared some of the views of the administration. But
                    I believe the most important factor was that they were not going to allow
                    themselves to be distracted from sharing in and pursuing the bilateral
                    transformation that I was talking about. India sees itself as a different kind
                    of country in the world. Unspoken in either our approach to India or in the
                    Indian approach to the United States is the China factor. We all are looking at
                    and wondering how China is going to evolve. What role will it play in the 21st
                    Century? As a strategist, and one who knew China well from his years of teaching
                    Chinese military officers under a special program at the Kennedy School and from
                    regular trips to China, Bob Blackwill was keenly aware of China. Although he
                    never spoke on this publicly, nor does the Administration, it was in this
                    important context, as he saw it, that a strong U.S.-India relationship is vital
                    for both countries, and I know this is how the Indians saw it as well.</p>
                <p>India shares a very long border with China, fought a war with China back in 1963
                    which it lost. It sees itself now as having new technological prowess and
                    strength as potentially a major player in the world economy. It wants to be
                    taken seriously, especially by the United States. The Soviet Union is long gone.
                    As you said earlier, a new generation has come to the fore. So they're committed
                    to building the relationship with us. They may have had views about particular
                    aspects of U.S. policy but they rarely allowed themselves to get wrapped up in
                    that. Nor did the media, again part of this very surprising change in attitude.
                    The leftist parties, which were very prominent when I was in Delhi in the early
                    80's, are fairly marginal in Indian politics today. There's a whole new
                    generation in charge now which has gone beyond the thinking of earlier times.
                    So, no, that's a long way of saying there was very little in U.S. policy that
                    really prompted a negative reaction and certainly nothing similar to what we saw
                    in Europe, for example, among our traditional allies. For example, arising over
                    Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting, for one might say that the Indians
                        already had gotten over their anti-Americanism where the Europeans had been
                        sitting around and for years under the thumb of the United States and
                        getting tired of it. Here's a great chance to get out and venture annoyance
                        without any particular repercussions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>THIBAULT: Right, and I think so much of dealing with the Indians, as is the case
                    in Asia more broadly and the Middle East, is reflecting a respect for them. We
                    have worked very, very hard to do that and deal with them as a major, serious
                    country, which is how they view themselves. And to work hard to get our
                    bureaucracy to buy into developing ways in which we can work together with India
                    for mutual benefit. That is not easy. These all sound like pious platitudes but
                    they really are not, they really are not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I've had people talk about who have
                        dealt with India in the past, India and Pakistan, was that whereas the
                        Pakistani embassy seemed to know how to get out and glad hand its way around
                        Congress and do the right thing, the Indian embassy, from the ambassador on
                        down, seemed to be very concerned about their dignity and would only deal
                        with people of a certain rank and all this, which essentially hindered them
                        very badly in playing the Washington game. Has this changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: Well, of course, I was not in that great a position to observe their
                    Washington operations but I certainly suspect it has changed. If anything,
                    there's a complete reversal of views in official Washington, certainly on the
                    Hill, towards Pakistan and India, particularly since 9/11. If there's one thing
                    that we now devote a great deal of attention to is having shared values.
                    Remember I said that for Saudi Arabia we had plenty of shared interests but no
                    shared values, whereas with India we had relatively few shared interests but
                    lots of shared values. Today we have lots of shared interests and shared values
                    with India. We had a constant flow of members of Congress to India and it was
                    very positive. You have the Indian-American community. I haven't talked about
                    that but the Indian-American community is very large now, very influential,
                    these are very successful people. You have a stake now at the political level,
                    at the district level, for many members of Congress. You also have a business
                    relationship which is very important, is growing very rapidly. So the threads
                    that link us together are far more significant today and have far greater weight
                    today than they did 15 or 20 years ago when the period you were mentioning
                    existed, far more than with Pakistan, far more than with Pakistan. We're talking
                    now of the president visiting India, he's made a commitment to do that. The
                    Indian prime minister is expected here shortly, this summer. I'm not sure the
                    embassies, here at least, play that key a role but they don't get in the way,
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: I left there in July 2003 and I decided that I would retire at that
                    point. I could have stayed on in the Foreign Service for another two or three
                    years. By that time I'd been promoted to MC rank, minister counselor rank.
                    Ambassadorial appointments that came up for the region that I was familiar with
                    were given to others and I decided that there was no particular advantage to
                    remaining in the Department and so I decided to retire, which I did in October
                    '03. I had come home, and I took the job search program, and have been very
                    happy since then.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing you haven't mentioned, talking about Blackwill
                        and going at 24/7, hours a day, seven days a week, what about family life
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIUBAULT: My children were grown by the time I came to New Delhi in 2000. My
                    oldest boy was already married and on his own, and my second son was also on his
                    own. They both were leading their own lives and were and are very successful in
                    what they do. My wife and I had been a team ever since we married. She was
                    extremely active in the American Women's' Association in Delhi, of which she was
                    the president, and with the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce. Many of the
                    things I was involved in we did together. I would be very active during the day
                    and it was sort of a seamless flow into the evening and she would be there with
                    me. She had been a full-time teacher at all of our previous posts at the local
                    American school, including New Delhi in the early 80's. And she resumed that in
                    Delhi when we returned, but more as a long-term substitute teacher. This gave
                    her time to cultivate a very wide circle of friends, a great asset to me, I
                    might add. She has known India as long as I have. We were married there, we had
                    many, many friends. We felt completely at home in India. We had a great house.
                    It was a wonderful assignment for both of us.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>THIBAULT: It's been a pleasure.</p>
