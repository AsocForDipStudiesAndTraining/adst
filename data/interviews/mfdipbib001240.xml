                <p>AMBASSADOR LEON J. WEIL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 2, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 2, 1991. This is an interview with Ambassador
                        Leon J. Weil concerning his time in Nepal and is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, I wonder if you would tell me a little bit about your
                    background—where you were educated, where you came from?</p>
                <p>WEIL: I always lived in New York City, but I never went to school in New York
                    City. I was always off in New England somewhere. I went to Berkshire School in
                    Sheffield, Massachusetts and from there I went to Princeton University. During
                    that time, which was the end of World War II, I left the University for a brief
                    stint in the U.S. Navy and then returned to Princeton and graduated in 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: I was born in June 15, 1927. When I graduated from Princeton I took a
                    little time off and about six months later I entered the securities business in
                    New York City. That basically has been my career throughout my entire life. I
                    was always in the securities business, although I had many other interests.
                    However up until the time President Reagan appointed me Ambassador to Nepal I
                    had been in the securities business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you, either in college, prep school, or while in the
                        securities business, gotten involved in or interested in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WEIL: I never, of course, dealt with securities that were overseas, but I was
                    always interested in history. As a matter of fact, I had majored in economics,
                    but the best grades that I got in college were in history. I was always
                    interested in political affairs and joined various political clubs at college,
                    like Whig Clio and those kinds of organizations, and thought very seriously of
                    going into the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in
                    Princeton. But then I got into major economics and made history and public
                    affairs sort of an avocation rather than a vocation.</p>
                <p>I became involved in political affairs when I graduated and came back to New York
                    from my brief stint in California and I joined the New York Young Republican
                    Club. Those were the days when guys like John Lindsey, Robert Price and a number
                    of prominent people, whose names I can't recall right away, were involved. I met
                    people there such as William Rusher [phonetic], Cliff White...names that may not
                    be familiar to you, but they became involved in Republican Party politics as we
                    got more mature. I really loved that and became very active and wound up on the
                    Republican National Finance Committee.</p>
                <p>Eventually, years later, of course, I was the Chairman of political committees
                    that elected James Buckley to the U. S. Senate and I became fairly
                    well-known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you got involved in politics, how does one
                        get involved in politics? What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, you know it is a long process. People become involved in politics in
                    different ways. For me it was originally joining the New York Young Republicans
                    Club. We used to have meetings on issues of interest. But, of course, little by
                    little, people from the Club began to run for public office. Then you start
                    getting involved in the political campaigns. Of course, the senior Party too
                    relied on the Young Republicans Club, or did in those days (I don't think the
                    Club is that active anymore), for workers. Therefore you find yourself getting
                    involved in somebody's campaign for mayor, for congressman... I remember Ted
                    Kofferman [ph] was a congressman from my district here for many years. There
                    were others. William Green is now the congressman from my district. But you get
                    involved in these campaigns and if you like it, you continue to stay involved.
                    And I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it, as far as our interview is concerned, the
                        operative period was the Ronald Reagan time, because you became Ambassador
                        in 1984.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ronald Reagan first ran in 1980. How did that come
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WEIL: Back in 1979, when he was seeking the Republican nomination, I was
                    approached by some political friends who wanted to know if I would become
                    involved in this effort. I said, “I would.” Do you want me to name of these
                    people?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: These people were Maxwell Rabb, who later became Ambassador to Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom, by the way, I have interviewed.]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Have you. A delightful man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Then there was Helene Von Damm, who became Ambassador to Austria. I had
                    known these people. We had been friends. Max called me, and said he thought this
                    would be a good one to get involved in. I hadn't signed on to John Connally or
                    George Bush.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were other candidates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: These were the other candidates. Howard Baker, John Connally, George Bush
                    and there may have been others—perhaps Dole, I don't remember. Those three were
                    the main ones. Ronald Reagan was actually not too well known in New York and had
                    very little support there. But I signed on to the Reagan effort in New York.</p>
                <p>What happened was very interesting because Ronald Reagan decided or the campaign
                    organization decided that New York City would be the location for his formal
                    announcement of his candidacy for the Republican nomination. We all then started
                    to work on a dinner where he would make that announcement. That was a major
                    effort. We had the New York Hilton, I believe...I am not sure now. But anyway,
                    we had a major hotel in New York. It was our job to sell tickets to the dinner
                    to raise money.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Incidentally, we did something in that dinner which I will never forget and which
                    is probably a good thing to put into this oral history. We had a rule that
                    anyone who bought a ticket—in those days the ticket was only $500, which by
                    today's standards is cheap for a political dinner—could bring someone under 18
                    free. So the dinner took on the aura of a family affair. It was unlike any
                    political dinner I have ever been to. People came with their children and it was
                    exciting. The feeling of it was just wonderful. I don't think I have ever really
                    attended a political dinner with that kind of atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They tend to be pretty stodgy affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Very stodgy with corporate tables and that kind of thing. But this
                    particular dinner was a family affair and there was lots of enthusiasm. Ronald
                    Reagan came to New York, and he made his formal announcement that he was a
                    candidate. A lot of those people who worked on that dinner became members of his
                    administration. There was John Shad [ph], who became Chairman of the SEC and
                    later on Ambassador to the Netherlands; Raymond Donovan, who became Secretary of
                    Labor; Charles Wick, who became Director of the U.S. Information Agency; William
                    Casey, who later became Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. We all
                    worked on the dinner.</p>
                <p>After the election, many of my friends suggested that I join the Administration
                    as many of them did do. But I didn't feel that the time was appropriate for me.
                    I couldn't really leave my business. I wasn't financially comfortable in just
                    dropping my business. So I stayed in private business. I was, however, invited
                    to join the President's Council for Physical Fitness and Sports. I had always
                    been very active in sports and similar activities. So I was appointed by the
                    President to serve on the President's Council. This was a Presidential
                    appointment, but it was a voluntary job. Our Chairman at the time was the coach,
                    George Allen, who coached the Washington Redskins for many years.</p>
                <p>I, however, had occasional discussions with the White House. I had been to Nepal
                    on several occasions with an organization that I am still very active
                    with—Outward Bound—and was quite interested in the country. The White House knew
                    that I was interested in going to Nepal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say, “the White House knew,” did you have any
                        particular point of reference there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: I had friends there who were in the White House personnel section. Earlier
                    I mentioned Helene Von Damm, well prior to her becoming an ambassador, she
                    served first as assistant director and then as director of the White House
                    personnel section. She knew and it was in the file that I was potentially
                    interested in Nepal. The post wasn't open at the time, and I wasn't ready anyway
                    so we put it all on hold.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Several years later, towards the end of the President's first term, my situation
                    changed. We had sold our business and I was more independent. I decided that
                    this was the proper time for me to enter public service. I let them know in
                    Washington, and by a lucky coincidence, I was informed that the ambassador in
                    Nepal, who I had actually known, Carleton Coon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, I have interviewed him too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Have you? He was getting ready to come home, and the post was open. So the
                    White House put me in for it and, I don't have to tell you the process which is
                    very complicated, I was nominated for the position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for preparation for the post, both for the
                        Senate hearing, which approved your nomination, and for getting ready to go
                        to the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, I was fortunate in that I had the time to devote to training for the
                    post. I attended the Ambassadorial seminar which was given in the State
                    Department by Shirley Temple Black, and David Newsom. That was very interesting.
                    I took the two-week course in South Asian studies at the Foreign Service
                    Institute. And I worked with the Nepal Desk which set up briefings for me with
                    various people within the Department of State and in other Departments over a
                    period that lasted from late May, 1984 through July. So I was lucky to have a
                    rather long period of gathering information and preparing for the post. Part of
                    the preparation was for the hearings. When my hearing actually took place, I
                    went up to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room. I knew there would be
                    one other Ambassador appearing that day and it turned out to be Anthony
                    Quainton, who was just leaving his post as Ambassador to Nicaragua and was about
                    to appear before the Committee to be Ambassador to Kuwait.</p>
                <p>When we got into the hearing room and sat down at the table in front of that
                    horseshoe desk, Senator Rudy Boschwitz, the Chairman, asked who wants to go
                    first. I knew that the Senators were very anxious to question Quainton on
                    Nicaragua. They were more interested in where he had come from than where he was
                    going. So I said I would go first. We had a very relaxed and pleasant hearing. I
                    made a statement which I had worked on for quite some time with the help of the
                    Department. I gave that, then answered a few questions from the Senators and
                    then they turned their attention to Quainton, which was very interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>For the purpose of this history and for those who use this service, I think it
                    will be interesting to know that when you appear before the Senate on a
                    confirmation hearing, you have several audiences that you have to consider when
                    you are testifying. One audience is the Senate, but the other audience is the
                    country that you are about to go to. In the room were reporters from the
                    newspapers back in Kathmandu. They were taking down everything I was saying.
                    When Senator Pell asked me a rather sensitive question about a road that was
                    built from Tibet down across the border into Nepal, and he made some reference
                    to the fact that it was for the purposes of the Chinese coming down that road to
                    perhaps invade India, I had to be very careful in how I would respond. I wanted
                    to respond to the Senator, but I also had to remember that the people in
                    Kathmandu were paying a lot of attention to the way I was answering some of
                    these questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have had some ambassadors-designate that never made it
                        to their post because they were perhaps a little frank and didn't pay
                        attention to that other audience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Right. I remember with Maxwell Rabb's successor for instance. He made some
                    remark that roused the people in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went out to Nepal, did anybody in the Department
                        or elsewhere sit down with you and say, “These are American interests in
                        Nepal and this is what we need done,” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: You probably are aware that each post has something in their files called,
                    “Goals and Objectives.” Each year the Ambassador has to write such a
                    document—”Goals and Objectives.” It is done with the Department, with his staff
                    and what he, himself, feels. So I was able to review several of the “Goals and
                    Objectives” of my predecessors and from doing that you get a pretty good idea of
                    what the position of your government is in terms of its relationship with the
                    host government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go out with one or two bees in your bonnet that
                        you felt you wanted to focus on? Were there any problems?</hi>

                <p>WEIL: I had been to Nepal on two previous occasions and by coincidence I had
                    actually had lunch with Carleton Coon in his residence back in 1981 never
                    dreaming at the time that I would be his successor and that his home would in
                    three years be my home. I kind of knew where I was going, but in terms of a
                    fixed agenda, I did go out with a pretty open mind. I knew our overall goals and
                    objectives, which don't change very much in a country like Nepal. But I wanted
                    to emphasis private sector development. I happened to have the opinion that
                    countries develop through the efforts of their own people and that their own
                    people are more effective when they are working in their own self interest,
                    rather then working for some state organization. And I think the events of the
                    last few years has proven that these state-run economies have generally
                    failed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For historical context, in the last couple of years the
                        Soviet Socialist model throughout the world has gone through an absolute
                        collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Correct. Of course, my going out there was prior to that. Nevertheless this
                    was what I was very sensitive to. I wanted to go out there and kind of be the
                    instigator of private sector development and as a result of that I became
                    involved in the development of the Kathmandu Stock Exchange. If one could say
                    that one had a monument to his tour, I suppose you could say that the Kathmandu
                    Stock Exchange turned out to be my monument.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather then wait and come back, why don't we talk about it
                        now? What was the situation there, stock exchange-wise when you came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WEIL: Fortunately, at the time I arrived, the government of Nepal had just passed
                    a law which permitted the creation of public stock companies. There had been an
                    institution in the country...it had a different name, but had to do with the
                    marketing of government bonds to private investors in Nepal. This, of course,
                    was very small. This new piece of legislation which was passed just at the time
                    that I was arriving created an opportunity for public shares and therefore the
                    institution changed its name from its previous name, which I can't
                    remember...something like Kathmandu Securities Marketing Board...to the
                    Kathmandu Stock Exchange. Just a few weeks after I arrived, I saw a notice in
                    the English-language newspaper, Rising Nepal, that there would be a formal
                    ceremony commemorating the establishment of this new institution called the
                    Kathmandu Stock Exchange, which actually was simply a change of name from the
                    previous organization. So I had my secretary call up and tell them that the
                    American Ambassador would be coming. There reaction was one of great elation.
                    They never dreamed that anybody from the diplomatic corps would be coming to an
                    almost mundane kind of event. But when I got there, there was a seat of honor
                    for me. They were delighted because they had heard that I had spent my entire
                    career in the securities industry. When I came to this occasion and met the
                    officials I told them that I would be delighted to help them and work with them
                    and be of special assistance to them. And I did. I arranged for the director of
                    the Exchange to come to the United States under a USIA tour. He spent a month
                    here going to the New York Stock Exchange, the SEC, the Boston Stock Exchange
                    and learning how our country did it. I also sent him off to Bangladesh because I
                    traveled to Bangladesh once and had visited their stock exchange and wanted the
                    Nepalese counterpart to go there. That was helpful to him.</p>
                <p>Then I received a number of prominent visitors while I was in Nepal. Among whom
                    were John Shad, the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission; and John
                    Whitehead who had been a senior partner of Goldman, Sachs and also Deputy
                    Secretary of State. These individuals had learned of my work with the Stock
                    Exchange and they wanted very much to come to the Stock Exchange, so they
                    visited the Exchange and, of course, this made the people there feel like they
                    were very important and therefore it was a wonderful boost to their morale.</p>
                <p>Another fortunate thing that happened was that while I was there Steve Weisman,
                    who was the New York Times Bureau Chief in Delhi came up to Nepal to go on a
                    trek. I was with him on this trek as was Carrie, my daughter who is sitting next
                    to me. Steve Weisman and I were walking along the trail one day when he said,
                    “While I am up here, I would like to do a story about Nepal. Do you have any
                    ideas what would be an interesting story?” So I started to tell him about the
                    Stock Exchange. He thought that would be interesting. I said, “Okay, when we
                    walk back to Kathmandu we will go over there, and you can see for yourself.”</p>
                <p>So I took him over and he wound up with an article about the Kathmandu Stock
                    Exchange which received enormous publicity. It was in the International Herald
                    Tribune as well as The New York Times. Many friends of mine in the securities
                    business saw it—John Shad saw it, John Whitehead saw it. Therefore I became
                    somewhat famous for assisting this development of a stock exchange in one of the
                    world's least developed countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How has the Stock Exchange been doing? Has it been an
                        element within the changing of the economy and development of Nepal or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, it's had some concrete economic benefit, but in the beginning I felt
                    that it had more of a symbolic benefit in that it became symbolic of the
                    government's commitment to free enterprise. Later on as things developed, there
                    were a number of companies that actually raised capital through the Stock
                    Exchange. There were two joint venture banks, one was Hindu Suez, which had a
                    joint venture to establish a Hindu Suez Bank in Nepal. They raised money through
                    selling shares. And Grindley's Bank also raised money through selling shares.
                    There was some activity. They started out with eight companies that were listed.
                    The secondary trading was virtually nonexistence. Companies agreed to be listed
                    because the law encouraged listing by granting a slight tax reduction. So it
                    paid you to be a listed company because you got a tax reduction even though
                    there were no shares actually traded. For instance, there was a hotel that was
                    listed. The hotel had maybe 12 shareholders. They were not buying or selling.
                    They did qualify technically as a listed company and received whatever benefits
                    listed companies got. There were a few other companies like that. And then there
                    were a few companies that had maybe a 100 or so shareholders where occasionally
                    there would be a transaction. But there were no independent brokers in Nepal; no
                    telephone communications really in the beginning, so it didn't have all that
                    much effect.</p>
                <p>In the second year of this, however, when they started to do some underwritings,
                    they started to develop a list of shareholders. Each bank underwriting created
                    about 5,000 new shareholders. So when I left Nepal the number of listings had
                    gotten up to about 23; the number of shareholders was somewhere over 15,000,
                    which is a tremendous thing when you think of the economic poverty in Nepal.
                    There was a little bit of trading.</p>
                <p>Now, I have been back to Nepal twice. I am leaving in three days to go back on my
                    third visit since I retired as Ambassador. I was back last November and had
                    lunch with the staff of the Stock Exchange. They told me that the number of
                    listed companies has now grown to over 40 and the number of shareholders has
                    increased to about 30,000, which again is remarkable. So it is starting to have
                    some effect. But when I was there it was very slow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now back to when you arrived, what was your attitude
                        toward the Department of State, the Foreign Service and all?</hi>

                <p>WEIL: Coming from the political side and having so many friends on the political
                    side, some of whom were serving as Ambassadors, I became aware of the
                    conversations about the conflicts between the career and non-career Foreign
                    Service officers. Some of my friends had some unfortunate experiences and tried
                    to warn me about one thing and another. I went out with a completely open mind.
                    I can't really tell you the reason, but I think perhaps it was the people who I
                    found at the post who happened to be very, very nice and we got along
                    beautifully together. I never encountered the slightest bit of career vs
                    non-career feeling in any of my dealings at any time during my tour of duty with
                    the Department.</p>
                <p>My predecessor, who was a career Foreign Service officer, and who as I said I had
                    met, I had lunch with him so he knew me and I met him again when he came back to
                    the States for a visit in 1983. Again, this was long before I even thought I
                    would be nominated. He wrote and told me that in his opinion I should keep his
                    Deputy Chief of Mission, who was Jim Cheek. Jim had been a Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of State. He was actually overqualified to be a DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I sat on his promotion panel around that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, Jim turned out to be a wonderful guy and accepted me completely. We
                    got along beautifully together. He was a very experienced guy. I relied on him.
                    He showed me the ropes. He had the perfect attitude and I was very, very
                    comfortable with him. He was only with me for the first nine months, but that
                    was enough to get me started. Then I returned to the United States to interview
                    candidates to succeed him. I selected Lewis McFarland. He came out, and was with
                    me for the next three years, because I served over three years. Lew was with me
                    right through to the end of my tour and actually stayed on for the first few
                    months of my successor's tour. He and I got along famously together, and we were
                    still friends. I talk to him quite often. He is retired now.</p>
                <p>So anyway, I never became involved in any of this controversy you often hear
                    about between career and non-career people. I can't explain the reason for it,
                    but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is an attitude on both sides and whether or not
                        diplomacy has been used at some of our embassies, both by non-career
                        ambassadors and career Foreign Service people. Diplomacy is not always
                        indulged in in the house and it should be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: That is true. And some of the non-career people probably go out with a chip
                    on their shoulder. And maybe they have run into certain situations which cause
                    them to have this chip. For whatever reason, it didn't happen to me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question on the side because it has become sort of
                        important now. When you were given a list of candidates to be a new Deputy
                        Chief of Mission, there has been even a court case saying that the State
                        Department was not putting enough women into the pot to choose from. Did you
                        find this your experience or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, in thinking back to the list of candidates for DCM, I don't recall
                    seeing a name of a woman on the list. They gave me a list of about five or six
                    candidates. I interviewed them all. But I was the eighth U.S. Ambassador to
                    Nepal and of the eight ambassadors, including me, two of them had already been
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among them Carol Laise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Carol Laise and Marquita Maytag. Since I left there have been two
                    ambassadors and the one currently serving is a woman. So out of ten you have had
                    three who are women.</p>
                <p>In choosing a DCM, especially for a non-career ambassador, the discrimination
                    doesn't really occur for women, but where it does occur is in candidates who are
                    serving overseas in posts where you can't interview them. Now the career people
                    have maybe served with these people and they know them. Maybe they ran across
                    them at previous assignments, so they had some familiarity with them. But, if I
                    was given a candidate who was a political officer in Pakistan or in Europe or
                    Africa somewhere, if I couldn't interview the candidate personally, I would be
                    very uncomfortable with that. So there is where you get discrimination. So all
                    of my candidates were people who were in the Department. I had a few corridor
                    walkers who were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Corridor walkers were people who have not yet been placed,
                        sometimes because they were difficult to place and sometimes by chance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: But I was fortunate there were a number of good candidates and I selected
                    Lewis McFarland who turned out to be a real joy for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Nepal when you got
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: In 1980 there had been some disturbances and as a result there was a
                    referendum on whether or not Nepal should continue under the party-less
                    Panchayat system with reforms or switch to a multi-party type of government,
                    which they had experimented with 20 or so years before. The referendum turned
                    out to be about 55 percent to retain the present system with reforms and 45
                    percent to go with a multi-party system.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The principal reform was that the people could now elect directly the members of
                    the National Assembly. The Assembly would then select the prime minister. There
                    was an election in 1981 under this system and a prime minister was selected. Now
                    this was before my time. In 1983, for the first time in the history of Nepal
                    there was a vote of no confidence in the parliament and the prime minister was
                    dismissed and a new prime minister was installed.</p>
                <p>But the system, this party-less Panchayat was in effect and these changes came
                    about as a result of reforms that the king had put in.</p>
                <p>There was a certain amount of unhappiness because Nepal was a very poor country.
                    You didn't hear too much about the opposition. Political parties were banned.
                    While they could meet without too much interference, they had to identified
                    themselves as banned parties. The strongest was the Nepali Congress Party. As
                    long as you said, “I am a member of the banned Nepali Congress Party,” you were
                    okay.</p>
                <p>So things looked all right in Nepal. There were the usual grumblings. You
                    couldn't tell what the opposition was. On the 19th of June, 1985, I was sitting
                    in my office and I heard what sounded like a loud thud and within 20-30 minutes
                    we got the news that five bombs had gone off in Kathmandu. Two of them were
                    outside the Palace. They were very small and didn't do too much damage, although
                    one of them did scatter bricks all over the business end of the Palace. Another
                    bomb went off in the Anapurna [ph] Hotel and killed three hotel employees.
                    Another one went off in the doorway of the Parliament building, killing one
                    person and injuring another. Then there were several other bombs that went off
                    in towns outside of Kathmandu. This was the first inkling as to the extent of
                    the opposition movement. It turned out that this particular group that set off
                    the bombs was a real extremist group. They really didn't have too much political
                    clout. The political clout from the opposition came much later.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, came after I had left. The revolution that brought about the
                    subsequent changes and a new constitution for Nepal occurred about two years
                    after I had left. So while I was there there really was not too much
                    evidence...in 1986 during my tour there was a parliamentary election because
                    there was one every five years. They elected a new parliament and interestingly
                    enough, now that I think about it, there was quite a lot of turnover among the
                    people elected. A lot of the prominent people were defeated; leftist groups did
                    gain about 13 seats and people were quite surprised; and nobody really realized
                    the extent of the Communist Party activities throughout Nepal. It was all
                    illegal and it was done underground so that it was very difficult to get a
                    handle on it. But they were starting to work and it all came to a head in
                    1989.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, there were a considerable number of
                        people put in jail weren't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WEIL: I wouldn't say a considerable number of people. There were some political
                    prisoners, but I don't think that there was a large number in jail. The father
                    of the Nepali Congress Party spent about 16 years in jail, and was not in jail
                    during my tour. As a matter of fact I went to his house to attend a wedding
                    reception for his daughter, so he couldn't have been in jail at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you under any instructions or if not instructions
                        were their any media pressure from the United States to have the American
                        Ambassador try to put the Nepalese on a course more in line with the way we
                        saw things? Was this a problem for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, one of our objectives in Nepal was, in typical State Department
                    language, to encourage the king to continue the democratization process and urge
                    him to make additional reforms. That was the way we put it. We wanted to
                    encourage him. We wanted to say to him, “Look you are moving in the right
                    direction. We want you to continue to move in that direction as fast as you
                    think you can go.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds rather presumptuous. What did it mean in actual
                        fact? How did you and your staff interpret this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: I don't agree with you that it sounded presumptuous. I think it would have
                    been more presumptuous if we were to say to the king, “Now look, this is the way
                    we think you should run your country.” We didn't do that. We wanted to encourage
                    him to continue what we felt he was trying to do. Now, as it turned out he
                    didn't do it fast enough. He got behind the curve and never caught up. But that
                    is another story. Our official policy was to encourage further reforms and move
                    the country towards democracy. We basically wanted to insure Nepal's sovereignty
                    and stability. We, of course, have a great deal of interest in Nepal's welfare,
                    just because they are such nice people. We have a humanitarian interest in
                    Nepal. But aside from that our interest in Nepal was to preserve its sovereignty
                    and stability because it is an important buffer between two giant
                    neighbors—China and India. These two neighbors have fought several wars and
                    Nepal occupies a 500 mile border between the two countries, so basically we
                    wanted Nepal to exist and we thought we would help them by: 1) assisting in
                    their economic development and 2) encouraging them to develop their political
                    system and encourage democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how does one encourage democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WEIL: Well, it is very difficult when you have to maintain your relations with a
                    government. But then there are lots of ways you can encourage them to become
                    more democratic. You do this through your contacts, and through any way you
                    want. I, for instance, had public contact with the Nepali Congress Party which
                    was officially banned as were all parties in Nepal. I invited them to the
                    residence for lunch. I attended the leader's reception. As a matter of fact we
                    had a little meeting...the State Department didn't instruct me to do any of
                    these things, it was just my own way of carrying out the goals and objectives.
                    There is certainly a lot of leeway in letting you do what you want to do. We had
                    a meeting of the Ambassadors from the UK and Germany and myself to discuss
                    whether or not we would attend this very public wedding reception for the
                    daughter of the leader of the Nepali Congress Party who had been in jail. The
                    present king's father put him in jail. King Birendra may have had him in jail,
                    too, in the late 1970s, I don't recall. We decided that we would attend the
                    reception and along with the Ambassador from India, we were the only members of
                    the diplomatic corps to attend the reception and it was so noted in the
                    press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place how did you deal with Nepalese
                        officials to get the normal government things done and were they taking due
                        note of what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: As far as the Nepalese officials were concerned you have to understand that
                    there were two parallel governments in Nepal. There was the elected government
                    and then there was the Palace. I used to joke that the system of government in
                    Nepal was a absolute monarchy operating the government through an elected
                    bureaucracy, which in effect was what it was. Now the government, which I
                    considered to be the prime minister, the foreign minister and the various
                    secretaries who ran the government, who were my contacts on a day-to-day basis,
                    they were not the ones to talk to as far as democratization was concerned. The
                    ones to talk to on that subject was the Palace because the king in those days
                    created the constitution. He gave it to his people. He could take it away. He
                    could amend it. That is not true today under the new constitution. But that was
                    the way it was during my tour. So it was useless to talk to the so-called
                    government about democratization, but I did in talking to the king in my private
                    audiences encourage him. You can't tell a king what to do, obviously, and that
                    would be presumptuous anyway. But you certainly went out of your way to pat him
                    on the back whenever he did anything that could be interpreted as encouraging
                    democratization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention that the German, British and American
                        Ambassadors—I would imagine that if you add the Chinese and the India
                        Ambassadors, these would be the countries that probably had the greatest
                        role, you might say, of interest. Was the fact that Nepal has always had
                        very close relations to the British, was he sort of the first...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WEIL: No, the British had an important role, but the most important ambassador as
                    far as the Nepalese are concerned is the Indian Ambassador, because this is the
                    country with whom they have the trade. This is the country with which they have
                    a 500 mile open border and the majority of the economic activity was between the
                    two countries. That has to be Nepal's primary diplomatic relationship. A funny
                    thing is that when the ambassadors used to have meetings...for instance if there
                    was a crisis like a famine or an earthquake or various things that would come up
                    where the government would want all of the ambassadors to get together because
                    they were going to make an appeal to us, the Indian Ambassador rarely showed up,
                    because the Indian Ambassador never liked to become one of many in its
                    relationship with its neighbors. This was true in many other areas of
                    relationships with countries in South Asia. India always liked to deal one on
                    one with their neighbors. So the Indian Ambassador rarely showed up at these
                    meetings.</p>
                <p>But the most important ambassadors were the Chinese, because it was an important
                    neighbor; then the US and the German and the British for different reasons were
                    important to Nepal. After that came their other neighbors in South Asia, such as
                    Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka. Then the others were much less important like
                    Thailand, Egypt, Israel, Italy and the countries like that. In my tour there
                    there were 19 resident ambassadors. Most of the ambassadors were actually
                    domiciled in New Delhi and were ambassador to India from their respective
                    countries and also accredited to Nepal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you had your political section, CIA, Defense
                        attach�s...were you getting the feeling that either the Indians, the Soviets
                        or the Chinese were meddling in Nepalese affairs? You mentioned the Nepalese
                        Communist Party, was this internally driven or externally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: The communist situation in Nepal is a little mixed up because you have the
                    Chinese and their affiliated communist parties; you have the Soviets and their
                    affiliated communist parties; and you had the West Bengal and their affiliated
                    communist parties. So actually you had a lot of communist organizations and even
                    today, now that they are all legal and some of them are quite strong, there is
                    quite a diversity of them. They have controversies among themselves. The Chinese
                    supported communists and the Soviet supported communists and I do know the
                    Chinese and the Soviets did give active support to their respective communists.
                    It was always a source of great concern of the Palace. They were definitely
                    anti-communist. As a matter of fact the worse thing you could call somebody in
                    Nepal in the days I were there, was a communist. Today the communists are a
                    major force in the political life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Nepal's role in the world—the UN and things?
                        Were you running to them all the time asking them to vote this way and that
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WEIL: That was a very important part of my job. We were constantly getting
                    requests from the Department to go over to the Ministry with a demarche on one
                    issue or another. We would always receive a visit from USUN—one of our
                    ambassadors to the UN would come out on a tour to South Asian countries and call
                    on the Prime Minister and review the issues that would be coming up in the
                    General Assembly and the Security Council. It was one of the more important
                    parts of my job to inform the Nepalese government of the various issues and hope
                    that they would see things our way. Fortunately, they did. Nepal had parallel
                    views to ours on many important issues in the UN. We were always very proud of
                    that. They had a much higher voting record as far as we were concerned than
                    India, which had one of the worst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Nepal, did you ever feel that China was
                        a menace or did the Chinese think Tibet was enough and weren't really
                        looking toward expansion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: No, China never appeared as a menace to Nepal. As a matter of fact, they
                    always appeared as a great help to Nepal in helping Nepal resisting the
                    pressures they would be getting from India. So they were there to insure Nepal's
                    independence rather than to threaten it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a tendency on the part of India to look towards

                </p>
                <p>WEIL: India's record as far as Sikkim was concerned which once was an independent
                    country and their sending troops into Sri Lanka, made Nepal very nervous. When
                    you really sit down and talk to a Nepalese historian, he will remind you that
                    Nehru once made the remark that India's northern defensive frontier were the
                    Himalayas and if you look at a map, the Himalayas are on the wrong border. This
                    is something the Nepalese always remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they want to have good relations with the major powers

                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Or identity. Nepal was always anxious to demonstrate their independence and
                    sovereignty. They did it in a number of ways. One of them was to be an active
                    member of the United Nations. They served on the Security Council, they
                    contributed troops to the United Nations Forces in Lebanon. They participated in
                    all national forums. They were members of the non-align movement. They went out
                    of their way to try to show the world that they were a country and independent
                    and sovereign.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WEIL: Right. The hermit kingdom episode lasted mostly from 1850 to 1950. After
                    1950 it opened up to the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about our AID program there? What were we doing and
                        looking at it from some distance, how effective was it do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Our AID program averaged around $15 million a year. At the time the program
                    started at that level, Nepal had about 15 million people. So it was a per capita
                    of $1, which is a little on the low side. Nepal is really not a country that has
                    any great strategic importance. It is a very useful country as far as we are
                    concern, but it is not one of the front line states on the edge of the
                    battlefield, so to speak, like Pakistan or Israel. So our aid was primarily
                    humanitarian. Of course it has been some time since I was there and I have
                    forgotten a lot of the details of our AID program, but in the beginning our
                    first AID programs built a few roads, eradicated malaria in the southern part of
                    Nepal, helped to open it up to agriculture.</p>
                <p>During the time I was there we were not getting involved in capital intensive
                    projects because we didn't have the money. We would do training programs,
                    contribute to teacher training. We had a program where teachers out in Nepal
                    would be trained over the air by Radio Nepal. We had special lectures and things
                    that teachers would listen to so they could upgrade their skills. We also
                    operated several integrated rural areas where we would try to do
                    everything—irrigation, agriculture, forestry, fish farming, etc. We had money
                    going into an oral rehydration program which we operated in connection with
                    money that was going into family planning. We would approach family planning
                    both from the conceptive side and from the health side to try to get the
                    Nepalese to realize that if they did certain things they wouldn't lose so many
                    children and wouldn't have to have so many children.</p>
                <p>How effective was all of that? You know, you don't know because you don't know
                    what it would be like if it hadn't occurred. I would hate to see nothing happen,
                    but the record is not a good one. I really would like you to tell me what
                    underdeveloped country in the world has really been helped by so-called economic
                    aid?</p>

                </p>
                <p>WEIL: I had a discussion with someone the other day and they pointed out to me
                    that in South America, for instance, which I don't know much about, the country
                    that is growing the fastest and has the best economy is a country where we
                    canceled our AID program and have refused to give them any foreign aid, and that
                    is Chile. For political reasons we canceled everything and yet now their country
                    is the one that is doing the best. Now, whether it is a cause and effect, I
                    don't know, but it makes one wonder.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about effect, what about American youth and the
                        hashish trail? That really goes back to the 60s and 70s, was there any
                        residue of this as being a problem for you as the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: By the time I got there in 1984 the hippie generation had started to age
                    and disappear. There were a few of them left in Nepal, but they were getting
                    bald and getting older. They were starting to go into the commercial
                    life—opening up little restaurants, etc. So the whole scene on freak street has
                    pretty well disappeared.</p>
                <p>There was, however, a re-emergence of a drug problem which didn't involve
                    foreigners or Americans, but started to involve the local Nepalese because Nepal
                    was right in the center between the golden triangle of Burma, Thailand, Laos and
                    the golden crescent, which was Pakistan and Afghanistan. The airport at
                    Kathmandu was one of the places from which some of these hard drugs would be
                    exported to Western Europe and elsewhere. One of our constant programs was to
                    encourage the Nepalese and help them tighten up on the airport.</p>
                <p>But as far as that hippie generation that you mentioned, it has pretty much died
                    out. Maybe Carrie, sitting next to me, knows more. She visited me on several
                    occasions. But there certainly wasn't much evidence of it when you walked
                    around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where there any other problems that I may not have touched
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: I thought you might ask me something like that. So I gave some thought to
                    it and there are two main problems that I would like to talk about.</p>
                <p>One of the main overall problems which entered into many, many areas of our
                    relationship, was the very fact that I was representing the world's richest
                    country in one of the world's poorest. The Nepalese could never understand why
                    the United States could not be more helpful to them. They reminded me, and they
                    were right, that they had been a friendly country, they had contributed troops
                    in World Wars I and II, they had parallel views on many important issues, they
                    were the only country in South Asia to recognize the State of Israel, and they
                    were a moderate member of the nonaligned movement, they tend to tone down some
                    of the radical states that were in the non-aligned movement. In light of all
                    this, they could never understand why we really didn't help them more. They
                    could not understand our own budgetary constraints, and they viewed us as being
                    so rich and they were so poor. That was something that sort of permeated
                    everything in our relationship that sort of created a bit of a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>One of the problems that I had, and this started during my consultations prior to
                    my going and it was a problem to the day I left: It was a problem that I never
                    realized existed and that is the conflict between the evangelists who wanted to
                    proselytize and the Nepalese Hindu State that outlawed conversion. When I signed
                    on I never knew that it even existed, but I was made painfully aware of it
                    during my initial consultations. I called on members of our congress who
                    represented the Bible belt, so to speak, and I was shocked by the intensity of
                    this particular controversy. There are people in this country who believe that
                    it is their religious right to go and convert...you used to hear in the old days
                    about converting the heathen, you don't hear that term anymore, but nevertheless
                    they do the same thing. They go out to convert people to Christianity. They feel
                    that it is their religious right to do so. When you interfere with their ability
                    to proselytize, you are actually interfering with their right to practice their
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Now this runs into conflict with a State that bars conversion by constitution. In
                    the Hindu religion you can not convert to it any way. You can't get in and you
                    can't get out. So this was a terrible problem as you can probably gather. There
                    is no solution to it. It was a constant source of irritation and
                    controversy...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, people would come out from the United States and do things illegally
                    and wind up in jail. Then, also, there were people knowing of the situation
                    thought that it was in their best interests to create a situation where they
                    would be put in jail to illustrate what they felt was the injustice. So you had
                    to deal with people who were extremists on this subject, who were moderate on
                    this subject, and on the other side people who were also extremists and
                    moderates. The Nepalese were embarrassed by the issue and tended to not keep any
                    of our people in jail over it, but to get them out of the country as
                    expeditiously as possible. That was the way they handled it.</p>
                <p>It was always a contentious issue and there are people in our congress who serve
                    on organizations who support proselytization. If you can figure out a solution
                    to all of this, I am sure you would go down in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have seen correspondence in our files dealing with
                        Greece where it is prohibited there too, going back to the 1860s on the same
                        subject. There is no answer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: No. I think that is a pretty good one to end on. There are a lot of
                    others—we had the drug problem, we had people who would get arrested, but these
                    were the normal day-to-day problems that you have. But the religious problem was
                    such a difficult one because there was no way to get it resolved. I am the kind
                    of person who likes to bring the two parties together and make some sort of
                    agreement and get the thing settled. But there was no way to settle this.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about Nepal when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WEIL: Well, I thought that Nepal was making uncomfortably slow progress, doing
                    things that they had proclaimed they were doing. I thought that the
                    privatization program was going too slowly. That there was more rhetoric than
                    action. I was very uncomfortable about that and made a speech on that subject
                    about two months before I left. Some of the radicals in the parliament got up
                    and said that I should be PNGed for making such a speech and criticizing the
                    government, but 97 percent of the people thought I had said the right thing by
                    pointing out that while the rhetoric was there, the performance wasn't and that
                    no efforts had been made to privatize some of the trading companies, the
                    national airline, the cement company...the major industries in Nepal were state
                    owned. I didn't feel that the country would make real economic progress unless
                    the private sector was given a chance.</p>
