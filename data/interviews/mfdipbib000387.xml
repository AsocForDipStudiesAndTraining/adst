                <p>Interviewed by: Monique Wong</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: December 14, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Monique Wong. I'm interviewing Nancy Forbord for
                        the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History and today is December 14, 1992.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Good, Nancy, here we are. I've been waiting for this interview for several weeks.
                    I thought I would start with your role in training. This has to be one of the
                    most important contributions I think you have made and you are still making to
                    the Foreign Service. Both training families and officers. Perhaps we can spend a
                    little time on discussing that? Could you tell me first of all how you got
                    involved and when that was?</p>
                <p>FORBORD: In training?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I first got involved, I guess, actually when I became a CLO in 1980
                    in Jamaica. I didn't realize that was really part of the job. I had done some
                    teaching before. I had taught using the Calvert System (home instruction program
                    used by families abroad to teach generations of Foreign Service children) in
                    Gabon with children. And I had done some substitute teaching in Milan, Italy and
                    also here in Washington. I had done a lot of storytelling. At one point I had
                    done storytelling as a semi-career. It was for about three years and I did it
                    mostly in libraries and with children's groups, parties for kids, and things
                    like that. And I loved doing that because I have a background in dramatic arts
                    and had always loved drama. I felt the storytelling tied in so well with Foreign
                    Service life because traveling around you collect all these stories. So I found
                    that I had particularly good African stories that I used to like to use,
                    particularly with children. So I did a lot of that.</p>
                <p>And when I got the job as a CLO, part of the responsibility was to train people,
                    basically to give them an orientation, when they first came to post. As I said,
                    at the time I didn't realize it was training. I thought it was sort of program
                    planning and introducing people to life in Jamaica. But I realize now that
                    really what I was doing was training.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was between 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: 1980 - '82.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were two years as a CLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, two years. And then when we came back to the States, I started on a
                    master's degree in health promotion counseling which was an interesting topic. I
                    was really interested - I had always been interested in health issues - and I
                    was interested in counseling because of the job in Jamaica as a CLO. And so as
                    part of the work for the master's there was a great deal of focus on workshops
                    because, to reach the largest number of people in any kind of health promotion,
                    workshops are the way to go. So we did a lot of work around planning workshops,
                    which basically involves training, and I began to see that what I'd been doing
                    in Jamaica had a connection to this in terms of setting goals for learning and
                    trying to reach a diverse population with a certain amount of information. And
                    in the course of that program, I planned a number of workshops for different age
                    groups and found I really enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>From that work, I got my job at the Overseas Briefing Center in which I started
                    doing a lot of training, and it became a lot more focused. What I found was so
                    much of what I did there at the Briefing Center was basically transferring a lot
                    of my experience to other people through training. And so I really started
                    training with the Overseas Briefing Center, and I started training on a regular
                    basis because that's what the OBC does. It's certainly one of its most important
                    functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when were you at OBC, Nancy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I was at OBC starting in January, 1988, and I was there until June of
                    1990. And I learned there to design training programs and plan programs for
                    employees and family members, and did a great deal of training around community
                    dynamics, community building, planning for overseas, protocol, U.S.
                    representation abroad; also training on an individual basis for people who were
                    planning for assignment overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With whom did you work at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: In the OBC?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, when I first started, Jean German was the director and Lee Lacy
                    was the deputy. And then Jean left, just about the time, in fact, that the OBC
                    became a separate school within FSI. It had been connected with Area Studies and
                    became a separate school at that time. And then Lee became the director and so I
                    worked as the information center coordinator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's back up a little bit. I just want to get some of the
                        details clear here. Jean German - wasn't she the first coordinator (Position
                        of title is “director.”) of the Overseas Briefing Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, no. The first person was Joan Wilson, and Fanchon Silberstein was
                    the second, I believe. And then I think Jean after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. And at that point, you were with the office
                        downstairs at C-Level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. When I came in, the office had just moved downstairs. And at that
                    point there was sort of a separation between training operations upstairs and
                    information center operations downstairs. And so I became actually, I guess, the
                    first coordinator of the downstairs. Well, that's not quite true. Marge Ness was
                    here as relocation advisor. When the office moved downstairs, my job became
                    coordinator of the Information Center and that's what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. And then what was the upstairs office for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: The upstairs office ran all the administration functions, workshop
                    planning and preparation, and training coordination. That was all from
                    upstairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So was Lee Lacy the first director of that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You mean of the office that was separated?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Jean was there when the separation took place. The separation took place
                    in September and Jean left in February. So she was, really, I guess you would
                    say the first director of the separated offices. I don't think anybody in the
                    OBC ever liked to think of it as being separated, but in fact the logistics were
                    such that it was separated.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least physically they were separated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Physically, yes, physically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also in the sense of having expanded as well, in space
                        and otherwise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, definitely. Absolutely. In fact, the operation went from serving
                    more or less 8,000 people a year to serving about 13,000 when it moved
                    downstairs. It increased dramatically. When it moved downstairs, it was more
                    accessible to people and there was so much more space. So you could expand and
                    encourage people to come. You know, more than perhaps had previously been done
                    just because of the space.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So prior to the people who were in charge of OBC before
                        Jean German had only one office on the fourth floor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, and everybody was there. And all the business was there. And you
                    can imagine that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That officers would come for information and that's where
                        they would go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, yes, that was it. You could go there in one little room and see the
                    videos. There were all the post boxes there. So the only separation was that
                    there was the director's office behind glass and both Lee and Jean had their
                    offices in there. You can imagine how crowded it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It was amazing. So it was really a wonderful thing when they got the
                    space downstairs and we moved down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit more about the operation of OBC
                        during those couple of years when you were there since you were really the
                        first one to get that office on C-Level going.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: How it operated, you mean basically, and how it expanded?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And also how you set up the things and the various
                        things that exist now probably have roots in the original plan and so
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You know, it's really interesting because I think that most of what goes
                    on now was in the original plan which is really interesting to me. I think that
                    the original people who started the Overseas Briefing Center really did think
                    pretty much of everything in terms of the original idea. I think what happened
                    was there was an expansion, an ability to serve many, many more people. And many
                    more specific individual needs than there had been before. I think moving
                    downstairs enabled us, for example, to expand the video operations. To expand
                    the amount of information in each post box. Certainly to expand the slide show
                    area because we went from, I think, one little slide show carrel to - now I
                    think there are six or seven, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably at least something for each post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, exactly. So I think in that sense there was a lot more possibility
                    to distribute and make available so much more information for people. In the
                    area of culture guides, for example. That could also be expanded. As we expanded
                    downstairs in terms of space, we also expanded in terms of staff. And that
                    enabled us to do a lot more work. When I first started, it was just me and an
                    information assistant in the front. And now it's the information coordinator,
                    two information assistants, and an information specialist. So it's now gone from
                    two people to four.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And full-time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, when I first started, my job was not full-time, it was four days a
                    week. I believe the information assistant was full-time. Now the two information
                    assistants each work four days a week, and the information specialist and the
                    coordinator are full-time, so it's really expanded in terms of what you can do
                    because there are so many more people there in the office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say the focus is on giving information to
                        officers and families for overseas posting rather than assistance in the
                        Washington area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I would. I'd say definitely. In fact one of the things we were
                    trying to do was find some way that we could provide more information for people
                    coming back, although I have to say there was not nearly as much interest as you
                    might think. We would get calls from people maybe asking for some information
                    like where to stay, that kind of thing about schools and we would refer them to
                    the Family Liaison Office at that point. Maybe they would call with problems,
                    and we would refer them to employee consultation service. But in terms of people
                    actually coming in and really wanting a whole lot of information about
                    Washington, we didn't see very much of that.</p>
                <p>We tried, in fact, to set up some things that might make it easier. You know we
                    started the returnee file for people who went overseas. We tried to do a similar
                    thing for here in the States and very few people seemed to be interested. They
                    were interested maybe the first couple of weeks, and then it petered out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. But yet everybody seemed to be saying that
                        Washington is one of the hardest posts to adjust to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I know. It's very interesting. And in fact I know that the Family
                    Liaison Office does get a lot of calls and they do want certain kinds of
                    information like babysitting information or schools. But general cultural
                    information, which is what the Overseas Briefing Center is so good at, basically
                    people don't think... At least they know the culture when they think of the
                    United States. So that's not such an interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that makes sense. Except for, of course, the
                        foreign-born spouses whom I've been working with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, that's right. Of course! And it did interest me in a way that we
                    didn't have very many foreign-born spouses coming in to look at that kind of
                    information or talk about that, although I know they took a lot of courses that
                    had to do with American studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nancy, do you happen to know - we were talking about the
                        original ideas for OBC - do you happen to know a little bit of the history
                        of how it got started?</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I know that AAFSW had a big role to play. I know that. And I know
                    there were a number of people who felt that spouses, particularly spouses, I
                    think, and family members, needed a lot more support than they were getting in
                    terms of information. Not so much in terms of counseling, but in terms of
                    information. There had been a wives' course that had been given starting, I
                    guess, years and years ago, starting in the '40's or '50's, that wives took. And
                    I think that was really the start of the Overseas Briefing Center even though it
                    wasn't called that. It wasn't until it became much broader that it was named the
                    Overseas Briefing Center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was Dorothy Stansbury. Does that name ring a
                        bell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, yes. Her name does definitely. You know, I don't really know that
                    much about it. I know that Barbara Hoganson knows a lot about the beginnings. We
                    used to talk about it. I know that there were trips, I believe paid, in fact, to
                    people who went to visit briefing centers. I know that in Canada, for example,
                    there was one that was there that the Canadians had set up for their technical
                    assistants. The Canadians had a big body of people who used to go all over the
                    world offering technical assistance, like our AID (Agency for International
                    Development). And I know they had one. And I think the people from here went up
                    there to look at theirs when they decided to set up the Overseas Briefing Center
                    to plan on how they would set it up, give them ideas (Joan Wilson proposed the
                    Overseas Briefing Center after attending a meeting in Canada. See her transcript
                    in this collection. Wilson's was the most eloquent and measured voice on spouse
                    concerns in the 1970s.).</p>

                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it did. I believe that Joan was the originator, or certainly the
                    first director.</p>

                        in other offices in the Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You want me to be honest?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think that of late people are beginning to recognize that the Overseas
                    Briefing Center fulfills a very, very special function and fulfills it better
                    than anybody else could. I think for a long time it was viewed as kind of - I
                    don't know how you would characterize it - as a step-child, perhaps of the
                    Foreign Service Institute. That it was an area that had a job to do, but I think
                    many people did not consider it or take it as seriously as they took other
                    functions.</p>
                <p>I think that part of it has to do with the fact that the Foreign Service has not
                    taken spouses seriously over the years. I think with the Foreign Service, like
                    any bureaucracy, it's not the fault of the individual. I think bureaucracies do
                    not like to have any kind of commotion from the outside or any kind of element
                    that may do something to destabilize the bureaucracy. And I think that spouses
                    in the Foreign Service are, by the nature of the Foreign Service, an element
                    that could do that. The fact that they are more closely tied to the bureaucracy
                    than other spouses would be because of the nature of moving around with that
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>And I think because of that, perhaps, there was for a long time a sense that the
                    OBC was a spouses' thing. And since nothing else about spouses was taken
                    seriously, I think the Overseas Briefing Center was not taken as seriously as it
                    deserved to be. Because from the first that I knew of it, it was a very
                    professionally run organization. And I think, in fact, probably has had as much,
                    if not more to do with the quality of training at FSI, as any other school. I
                    think that some of the things that the Overseas Briefing Center has done in
                    their training have been the most innovative. Not to say that the School of
                    Professional Studies does not do a fabulous job because they do. But I think in
                    the area of family training, some of the things that the Overseas Briefing
                    Center does is done nowhere else and certainly not done as well, I'm sure,
                    anyplace else as it's done here. I think now there's beginning to be a
                    recognition that the Overseas Briefing Center is unique and does offer extremely
                    high quality training.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Maybe part of the reason that the OBC was not regarded as seriously as it
                    deserved was because spouses move around of course, are forced to, you know, if
                    they're going to travel with their employee spouse. The fact that they are not
                    often or have not been career Foreign Service or Civil Service, and I think that
                    that's been viewed as just a sign that they are not professional. Because they
                    can only stay a short time, therefore they must be just ad hoc. And it's a shame
                    because that's certainly not the case. I think that the experiences that they
                    have had overseas usually have made them much, much more capable of doing this
                    kind of work than anybody else could who stayed in one place and never traveled
                    with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So most of the people who work at OBC are spouses
                        of...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Many of them have been. I don't know right now what the situation is.
                    When I was there, most of them were. Which in terms of work at the Information
                    Center was very important. Much of what they did was to really assist people who
                    were getting ready to travel overseas and planning for a life in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the relationship between OBC and
                        FLO, at least from your experience at the time you were the
                        Coordinator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it's been very good. I think that certainly, from what I see
                    now, they work together extremely well, supporting each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do they support each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I think that one of the ways they do it is by recognizing and
                    appreciating that they have very different functions. By realizing that FLO
                    works very, very closely with management in assisting spouses and family members
                    to be aware of how the Foreign Service can help them and ways that it can't. And
                    helping spouses and family members and employees to have access to the services.
                    I think the Overseas Briefing Center, on the other hand, is not involved with
                    that, but is involved with assisting people in training, information and
                    referral which is really a very different function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In general, you have said that the quality of the training
                        is very high and I think that's 100% correct. Do you think that it does also
                        prepare the Foreign Service spouses well for overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I think it does, definitely. I think that, from what I've seen. You
                    know, I've not gone over and conducted a study with spouses. It would be
                    interesting sometime to do that. To check with people once they're overseas and
                    find out. My impression has been that it's offered them a new way to look at all
                    the transitions they've faced and helped them to inform themselves so that they
                    can prepare themselves for realistic expectations in going to the new post. I
                    think probably in that area, maybe more than any other, it's really been
                    successful in helping people to establish realistic expectations and develop
                    skills around those realistic expectations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And would you say also planning is a major theme
                        throughout all the training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I would think so. Definitely. Yes, planning for whatever you can to make
                    sure that your life over there is as successful as it can be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You received a Meritorious Honor Award that's from the
                        State Department? For the work at OBC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, I received it for my work as CLO in Kingston. I received a joint
                    award at OBC. There was a joint award, a Meritorious Honor Award that was given
                    to, I believe, four of us at OBC. Primarily connected with that year when we
                    made the move and there was such an incredible increase in requested services
                    and work where we all just worked around the clock trying to meet the needs of
                    all the people coming to the OBC.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How have the training needs changed over the years since
                        you were Coordinator? You're still doing a lot of training now for OBC. Have
                        you perceived any kind of change in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well certainly I would say that I think spouses' needs have changed. I
                    think that the area of employment is much, much more important than it used to
                    be to spouses. I think education for children and helping children to adjust has
                    always been important. I think, though, that employment for spouses is becoming
                    more and more important, and anything that people can do to make themselves more
                    prepared for that. I think that would be a general focus. And I think it plays
                    into almost any kind of work you do with spouses. Anything that you can do to
                    help them prepare themselves so that once they get there, they will be able to
                    encounter any situation, and if it works out for them to find employment as a
                    result, they'll be ready for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say the need for employment is also a reflection
                        of the changes of the spouses as well? What they are now and what they were
                        before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I think it's two things. I think one thing, it's economic. That
                    many, many spouses now, most spouses, need employment in terms of being able to
                    pay the bills and particularly in preparing for children's education needs. I
                    think that's a big one. So I think the economics are probably the number one. I
                    don't know for sure again, but it makes sense. The other reason it's so
                    important is that many people feel if they have too large a gap in any kind of
                    work, when they come back to the States, it'll be very hard for them to get a
                    job. So it's not just the money at post, it's also the fact that when they come
                    back, so as not to have to start down on the bottom of the rung again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the continuity that we keep thinking of having to
                        maintain when we move around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Exactly. I think that's what it is. And always increasing skills,
                    practice, just generally keeping yourself ready to be able to come back into the
                    job market when you're back in the States. Not to say that there aren't spouses
                    who choose not to work. There are many who choose not to work. Many who feel
                    that they'd rather not. They'd rather just benefit from the experience of being
                    there, which is wonderful. I think if a person chooses that, there's no end to
                    what they can do at the post in terms of experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose the other factor could be also the background of
                        spouses. Perhaps they're more educated now? Would you agree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You know, I really would not agree with that, no. I would not say
                    they're more educated. I think that society places more expectations on them in
                    terms of what they're going to do with their lives in terms of a career. I think
                    that the level of education of spouses in the Foreign Service has always been
                    extremely high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my impression, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I think it always has been. I just think that because of the way
                    our society was prior to several years ago, most spouses did not anticipate
                    working for a lifetime. And I think again that the economics were such that
                    maybe they didn't need to as much as they do now. Even spouses here who lived in
                    the States all the time didn't necessarily work, so it wasn't just Foreign
                    Service spouses. It was a change of expectations and what spouses, women in
                    particular, want to do with their lives, I would say. I do think, though, along
                    those lines, that because of the expectations, because of the desire of most
                    spouses now to work, I think there is a lot more frustration overseas than there
                    used to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, in terms of employment. I think that because work is so hard to
                    find that's both rewarding and well-paying that there is a lot more frustration
                    in that area. When we first came into the Foreign Service, I don't remember
                    employment initially as being even a topic of discussion. It was nice if a
                    person found a job if they wanted to, but many spouses didn't want to. You know,
                    there wasn't that pressure like there is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there's a societal pressure. The expectation of women
                        to be working and having a successful career as well as a successful family
                        life and children and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: That's right. And I think also the reality of society in terms of
                    duration of marriages. I think many women need to prepare themselves in case
                    they ever are alone. I think there's a lot to that. I think that generally
                    speaking women nowadays think that they really do need to be able to provide for
                    themselves independently, if the need ever arises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: And I think very often women didn't used to think about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. Well, there's always accidents, too, that you
                        don't look for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Of course. You never know. You know a long time ago, somehow, people
                    didn't think about that. But I think that that, now coupled with divorce, with
                    some people deciding to live separate lives as some people do, that there's a
                    lot more to consider.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nancy, perhaps we can move on to some points about
                        training for children. We just mentioned that a little bit earlier. Tell me
                        first of all your perspective on how different it is, or if it is different,
                        to prepare children for overseas and to prepare adults, say spouses or
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it's very different. Not that a lot of us as spouses sometimes
                    don't... I've found going overseas that very often I seem to regress (laughter)
                    and really have some of the emotional needs that children have. I think that
                    happens sometimes when you go into a new environment. But I think the difference
                    is that as adults, we generally are much more able to express that than children
                    are, and I think that we can anticipate some of our needs, and I think very
                    often children can't. So it's hard to train children in the sense that you may
                    not be able to anticipate what their specific needs are because they may not be
                    able to identify those. With adults it's a lot easier, I think, for them to
                    identify their own needs, not completely, but easier than it is with kids.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also I was thinking that perhaps one month for a child
                        of three or four years old is a lot of time relative to a month to a twenty
                        year old or a thirty year old.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I think even in life term experiences. First of all, as you say, to
                    them two years just seems like a lifetime. To us, two years... Maybe we have to
                    change our lives. Maybe we're not quite as content as we would be, but it's two
                    years and we know that's all it is. But for a child those two years could be two
                    extremely important years, and the child may not even be able to understand how
                    here she could leave her friends and home for two years. So I think there is a
                    real difference in perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you tell me, since OBC is the major training arm for
                        the Foreign Service, how OBC provides training for children? What are the
                        different areas, perhaps different focuses, and whether you think that the
                        training provided for children is sufficient?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I can only tell you about my experience when I was there because
                    right now I'm not sure exactly what they're doing since I'm no longer in that
                    office, so I have to tell you that my experience was up until 1990. And since
                    then I have still been connected with the Foreign Service Youth Foundation, so
                    from that viewpoint I can tell you also what I know, but I can't tell you
                    currently exactly what courses they are offering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: But my experience was that, first of all, what they offered were the
                    courses for parents and children. The going overseas workshops in which parents
                    come with their children for Saturday morning workshops. And that's three hours.
                    And I think what's really good about that program is that it offers children an
                    opportunity to really discuss with their parents, maybe for the first time, how
                    they feel about the move, and they're encouraged to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the program start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: That started roughly at least ten or twelve years ago. It's been going
                    on a long time, and is still very, very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So children weren't neglected by any means right at the
                        beginning of OBC.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Not as far as I know, although again, I don't know the real early years
                    of OBC, but I think the Going Overseas Workshop was one of the first things they
                    did. It may even go back farther than that. It might. It very well might.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like it was there all along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: So they offered that for children and teenagers as well. They also
                    offered courses for parents, for example, in educating your child abroad; in
                    helping to create resiliency in children in the Foreign Service. That's a topic
                    that I think is very interesting, and I think Dr. Elimor Rigamer has been
                    instrumental in really alerting people to the special needs of children in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't he make a video or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, he's made a couple of videos. In fact, there was a series made in
                    which - I don't know if the OBC actually made the videos, but I think they
                    played a role in making these sort of landmark videos back about 1980 that had
                    to do with issues around families that were very, very good. They're still down
                    there in the OBC and they're funny to look at because they're old. The people
                    look like - long hair - you know the way they looked in the late '70's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and the clothes. The checkered skirts or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. But as far as what the people and kids were talking about, it's
                    basically the same things they still talk about. So in that sense, they're still
                    very current.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think the big change - there was two areas. One area was the Foreign
                    Service - I mean the Around the World in a Lifetime - AWAL for kids. And I think
                    in that regard not as much had been done for children as could of have been
                    done. That was re-entry - coming back to the States. And a group of kids
                    actually got together with a couple of adults and decided to start this club for
                    Foreign Service kids coming back to the States, and they called it AWAL - Around
                    the World in a Lifetime.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And I think that that was probably the biggest change for kids maybe in the
                    history of the Foreign Service in that it was finally a recognition that
                    children coming back from overseas had very special issues that they needed to
                    address. And that they needed to support each other and meet kids like them who
                    had been through what they had been through. The recognition that coming back
                    was very, very difficult for kids, particularly teenagers. After being in a very
                    protected environment overseas, coming back and facing American teenagers, you
                    can imagine, is not necessarily easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You haven't seen all the TV shows.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Exactly. And going into a huge high school not knowing a soul, and you
                    know how difficult it is for kids. So that group was founded. I think that
                    started about 1982. And they started with annual retreats for the kids - the
                    AWAL getaway. And that's still going on. I know the last one that I went on
                    which was not this year in November, but a year ago November, there were about
                    60 kids on that retreat. And they have a great time talking about their
                    experiences and getting to know each other. And from that have emerged a lot of
                    other activities for kids coming back. There's year-round activities planned.
                    And what you have now is an umbrella group called The Foreign Service Youth
                    Foundation that is basically the umbrella group to make sure that AWAL keeps
                    going and tries to support AWAL however it can to make sure that activities are
                    generated for kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that part of OBC or FLO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well OBC and FLO and the Office of Overseas Schools and AAFSW all play a
                    part. OBC is very important in this because they offer so many of the programs.
                    They offer the re-entry program for the kids coming back in September. They also
                    offer a day-long getaway program where they go off to Camp Hemlock and do
                    different activities to promote teamwork. A number of other activities are
                    sponsored throughout the year.</p>
                <p>And then of course FLO has a big part to play in support. They help with the
                    newsletter, they have a position over there now which is a point position, I
                    would say, for parents and teenagers when they come back to contact, to find out
                    about activities for kids in the area, and to support the activities of AWAL.
                    AAFSW has consistently funded activities of AWAL, and Office of Overseas Schools
                    has given a large, good substantial grant year by year to help support this
                    activity. So I think there's an awful lot of involvement right now from
                    different areas of the State Department trying to support activities for
                    teenagers.</p>
                <p>The other real change has been the security overseas seminar that the OBC offers,
                    and they developed a really extensive teen program that prepares kids on
                    security issues for going overseas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Describe for me a moment here, Nancy, please, about the
                        children. How do they compare to “regular” children? Children who don't move
                        around that much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Foreign Service children?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, there's been studies done, looks taken if not studies done of
                    Foreign Service kids to find out how they're different. I'm not an expert. I'll
                    tell you there are many people who know much more about it than I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you saw.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: But from what I've seen, and I think pretty much this is borne out in
                    the information on the research that is written about Foreign Service kids, and
                    kids who generally move around and live in different cultures, not just Foreign
                    Service, but kids who move around with military or with companies. There are
                    some differences in the Foreign Service, and we'll talk about that in a
                    second.</p>
                <p>But I think there is a tendency for example for the kids not to identify with one
                    place where they live. They seem to have a sense of being from a lot of
                    different places. If you ask them where they're from, they may not be able to
                    tell you where they're from. Or they may say, “Right now I'm from...” But not
                    “I'm permanently from” or “I've always been from...” So they have a sense, I
                    think, of rootlessness.</p>
                <p>They tend to be, I think, much more inclined to try to get to know people very
                    quickly and try to establish relationships quickly. On the other hand, some of
                    them don't. Some of them retreat completely and decide they're just not going to
                    make any more friends. If they have an experience at a certain time in their
                    lives that may be difficult for them, they may decide that it's too difficult,
                    too hard leaving friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it for your children?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>FORBORD: For mine? I think for mine, they went through stages. And I think you'll
                    find that Foreign Service children go through stages. There are times when it's
                    very easy to travel with them. There may be other times when it's very
                    difficult. I finally found mine were different. Certain times were very easy for
                    one and difficult for the other, and certain times were difficult for the other
                    and easy for the one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far apart are they in age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Just two years. So not very far apart. But I found, for example, that
                    one loved the experience of being overseas as a young child. It was just
                    wonderful and I think has formed his view of the world which is a very
                    international type view. He really loves people, loves different kinds of
                    people. For my other child, I think that was difficult because she is a person
                    who really valued friendships very, very highly, and I think for her to have to
                    break off friendships and move on was very difficult. The later years were
                    easier for her. When she became a teenager, I think that it was easier for her
                    in the Foreign Service. She was, I would say, more scholarly, and I think it was
                    interesting for her in a sense to see how the people learned and that kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>I think for my other child at this time, I think the teen years were a very, very
                    difficult time for him to move. So they had a real different experience,
                    although they've both come out of it now having a very similar viewpoint of the
                    world which is one that is, I would say, very, very international. They regard
                    the world as a very big place. They certainly respect people of all cultures,
                    have no patience with intolerance at all, and find that most Americans have a
                    real limited view in terms of the possibilities of people working together and
                    really respecting the gifts of people who are different from them. I think that
                    they are different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are they doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: They're both in school. My son is in college in California and would
                    like to do something in international work. My daughter is working in New York
                    City and would like to work with people in social services in some way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Without sounding sexist, Nancy, do you think that the sex
                        of the child has anything to do with how they react to the Foreign Service
                        life or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Not from my experience, and not from what I've seen. It may in some
                    cultures. I would say if you were in a culture and really heavily involved in
                    that culture, where you were not living in an American compound, where you were
                    really part of that culture, and your child, particularly a female child
                    perhaps, is exposed to a culture that maybe did not reinforce independence, for
                    example, like ours does, I think it could have an impact.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you actually where I did notice this, which is interesting to me. When
                    we went to Australia, I did notice that my daughter was very bothered by the
                    fact that girls were not necessarily encouraged to perform to, what she thought
                    to be,their potential. She thought that girls were regarded kind of
                    second-rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really? In Australia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: In Australia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was only a few years ago, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, when she was a teenager. She felt that girls were not taken very
                    seriously. And that bothered her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to see what year that was. That was
                        '86.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: '86, when she was in 9th grade. We've talked about this a lot since, and
                    I think my son agrees. He think she's right, that women are not regarded as
                    highly in Australia as they are perhaps here in the Washington area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nancy, we were talking about children in the Foreign
                        Service and you mention that your daughter and your son had very different
                        experiences, or different at different stages. I've heard a lot about how
                        children are socialized in terms of female and male child. Perhaps it's a
                        little bit more difficult for a girl child to be moving around, losing her
                        friends, because they tend to be in close circles. Would you agree?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>FORBORD: It's possible. I'm just thinking in terms of what I was saying before
                    about my daughter, of the fact that she reached a point where she just announced
                    she wasn't going to make any more friends because either her friends kept moving
                    away or she left. We had a tape recorder and we had a lot of taped stories, and
                    she reached a point where she spent a lot of time listening to those stories,
                    and I think maybe did feel, in fact, that the rug was being pulled out from
                    under her on repeated occasions. Not that, to tell you the truth, I think it's
                    had any long-term impact because she has no problem making friends and certainly
                    enjoys life and, looking back on it, enjoyed the Foreign Service. But I think it
                    could have an impact on a child if that's very, very important to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the Canberra experience for your daughter,
                        her comment on how women were not treated as equal as men...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: She felt not taken seriously. I think, certainly, in Australia... You
                    know, Australia is a very democratic society and in anything legal, women are
                    definitely treated as equals. But there is a tradition in Australia. It is very
                    much, I would say, a male dominated society. It goes back to the first
                    Australians who came, and matesmanship, and the fact that men's closest friends
                    were all men. I think to this day, the women are not treated as seriously or
                    taken as seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was a rough country, of course, when they first
                        went there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Exactly. And there weren't women at first. It was just men. And they
                    developed this very close attachment to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now my question actually is, if as a mother you find that
                        you are in the culture where the values are different than the U.S. The
                        things that you would want to enforce are not there in that foreign culture,
                        how would you go about reinforcing those qualities for your daughter, for
                        example - not just your daughter, your son as well - such as
                        independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well let me just make one comment first of all which I had not planned
                    to talk about, but since you brought it up, I think it might be interesting to
                    note. In the case of Australia, we made the decision to return to the United
                    States for very much that reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right? I was wondering why you were only there for
                        one year.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, that's why. It was an assignment that came up sort of overnight. We
                    went without much investigation. Our kids were in high school. We got there and
                    found, first of all, that the educational opportunities were extremely limited
                    for them. They had been in wonderful schools here and I think that both of us
                    just felt that it wasn't right. This was too important a time in our children's
                    lives for us to uproot them, take them and put them in a system that really
                    encouraged values that we totally disagreed with. We felt that it was a time
                    when kids make a lot of the decisions that will affect them for the rest of
                    their lives, and form a lot of their image of themselves. And for us it was just
                    not right. Things that they were exposed to as normal and acceptable were not
                    acceptable to us, and we made the decision to leave. We broke the assignment,
                    basically, because we felt it was just not worth it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just thinking of how easily that can be done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Not easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine it was very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It was very difficult. It was very difficult. In fact, the fortunate
                    thing was that a job opportunity came up for my husband. The State Department
                    happened to need at that moment a skill that he had. If it hadn't been for that,
                    we could not have left, at least not easily. But we made the decision that I
                    would go anyway with the kids because we considered that it was just too risky,
                    basically.</p>
                <p>Both of us felt very strongly that children needed to feel some sort of
                    encouragement, particularly in the field of education. That they needed to be
                    encouraged and know that education was one of the most important things in their
                    lives. And in Australia, it's not. Education is not very important. In fact,
                    intellectualism in Australia is frowned upon. It's looked upon as being kind of
                    silly almost. And for us it was just shocking. I wasn't at all prepared for it.
                    You'd think with all the time we've been in the Foreign Service, of all
                    cultures, that Australia would be the easiest, but for us it was the most
                    difficult. It was the first time I had really, really felt that I knew, I think,
                    what American values were, and the first time I realized how important it was to
                    me that our children have a sense of what it means to be an American.</p>
                <p>I think one of those is that there's a real admiration, I think, for making
                    yourself better. I'm not trying to condemn Australian society because I think
                    there are a lot of things that are wonderful about it. But that was one
                    characteristic that to me, I just did not want to see my children grow up with
                    the belief that that was okay because I didn't think it was okay. And basically
                    they didn't think it was okay either, but they thought it was kind of nice and
                    easy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very, very interesting. I guess I'm taken by surprise
                        here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I was taken by surprise, too, I'll tell you. I was absolutely
                    knocked off my feet. I couldn't believe it. And I found that I reacted to it so
                    much more strongly than I ever would have imagined. I found that it just meant
                    so much more to me than I ever could have thought. So we came back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps something similar happens to other families. I'm
                        just making this up in a way, from what I've heard, but perhaps often the
                        children get sent to boarding school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. That's an option. But again, we figured we have our children such a
                    short time. It made no sense to us. It was like all of the sudden, overnight,
                    here we were faced with this decision of sending our kids away. We didn't want
                    to send them away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you shouldn't have to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. So we figured, at this point, maybe it's very, very bad for the
                    career, but so what? It almost reached that point that we really didn't care
                    anymore. We knew that this was the most important thing to us. But fortunately
                    for us it worked out all right. We were just very, very lucky that it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Because it might not have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm looking at you now. We're sitting in your office on
                        the floor of FSI and you currently are training a officer for the political
                        training division. I thought you could tell me a little bit about what
                        courses you're running now, and a little bit about training officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I'm running Negotiations: Art and Skills, and that's a five-day
                    program for anybody in the Foreign Service. Not just in the Foreign Service,
                    anybody in the U.S. Government who is going to be involved in negotiations.
                    That's really for mid-level people. I do a course on multi-lateral diplomacy
                    which assists people in preparing for an assignment with a multi-lateral
                    organization or going out on a delegation. Many offices at State, particularly,
                    have people who are active in negotiations with organizations even though
                    they're stationed here. We also have people, of course, again from all different
                    agencies who come to that, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Then I do a course on politico-military affairs which is an
                    introduction/orientation for that bureau, really. People who are going to be
                    working in that bureau or overseas as political-military officers. And I do a
                    course on arms control which is pretty much, I would say, a survey of current
                    thought and the department's position on arms control.</p>
                <p>And then, scattered throughout the year, I do a lot of pieces on U.S.
                    representation abroad, diplomatic skills and protocol. And also other sessions
                    as they arise. I do one now, too, which is really fun, on orientation for new
                    people going to the U.N. in September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously these officer training courses focus more on the
                        professional aspects and skills and all that. Just in general, how do you
                        find, or do you find, any differences in doing this kind of training for the
                        officers and doing the other training that you have been doing for spouses
                        and families?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I think the major difference is that much of this work is very
                    substantive work. It's training, but a lot of it is orientation rather than
                    training. What you try to do is to structure the orientation in a way that
                    involves training with it. Then I think it becomes much more successful. But you
                    are very, very interested in these courses in the knowledge that people can
                    acquire, except in the case of negotiations.</p>
                <p>The negotiations course is more in a sense like the other courses in that it's
                    really teaching people skills and helping to change attitudes around the
                    negotiation process. Most of the courses that I've done previously were courses
                    that really did involve attitude changes, which is probably the most difficult
                    of all kinds of training. I think changing attitudes is very, very difficult,
                    and there's always a question of how much of that you can actually
                    accomplish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by a change of attitudes? From what kind
                        of attitudes to what kind of attitudes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, just for an example, I think around the area of community
                    building. People who maybe believe that the best way to operate in a foreign
                    environment is to go and get yourself fixed up in the American compound because
                    it may be the safest, it may be the most secure. Your needs may be taken care
                    of. When you try to change attitudes through teaching about community dynamics
                    and community building, you try to help people understand that by reaching out
                    and trying to go beyond that very, very fixed community, their life would be
                    different.</p>

                <p>And not necessarily better. For some it would be, for some it might not. But it
                    would be different. And you try to challenge people to at least try to reach out
                    and go to other elements of the community and broaden the community, and by
                    doing that, the whole community will be much healthier and better off. So that's
                    just an example of an attitude you try to change. And it's very difficult to do
                    that, and you never know for sure if you've accomplished it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's different for the officer training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. The officer training, except in the area of negotiations, which I
                    would say involves a lot of change around attitude because, when people come to
                    the negotiations course, they generally have a pretty fixed idea in their mind
                    of what works in terms of dealing with other people, and particularly in getting
                    what they want out of a negotiation. And by the end of the course, hopefully,
                    you have changed that attitude, or they have changed their attitudes toward
                    negotiation. You try to show them there's a different approach that probably
                    will work better for them. And if they try that in the class and it works for
                    them, then they go away with a different attitude about how to approach people
                    in a negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when you do the training for a family, obviously your
                        experiences overseas contribute a lot to how well you can run the training.
                        Now, just in general terms, would your Foreign Service experiences help with
                        the training of the officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Knowing who they are? Is that part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think so. You know, I've always - or not always, but very often -
                    worked in an embassy overseas. And I've had a lot of opportunity because of that
                    to really get to know how an embassy works and understand some of the concerns
                    and the problems of being an officer. Many, many times I've had as much contact
                    with officers as I have with people who are not officers just because of the
                    fact that, working in the embassy, that's often the way it is. And I've had an
                    opportunity to work with them on different projects and things of that sort. And
                    I think because of that, I've gotten to know a lot about what Foreign Service
                    officers need to learn in order to be effective. And I've really been exposed to
                    the running of an embassy operation. And I think that way it seemed to me that
                    it was fairly natural to come into this kind of work because I have had the
                    chance for years to work in an embassy situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like more spouses should be hired to train
                        officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FORBORD: I think that a lot of spouses certainly could do this kind of work and
                    could do it extremely well. I think that sometimes they don't think of
                    themselves as knowing all of that because, I don't know, I guess maybe they just
                    don't realize that the time spent in the embassy, that you really are doing very
                    much the same work that the officers are doing, very often. But I think often
                    spouses don't realize that in fact they can do the work.</p>
                <p>Sometimes they may even be able to teach it better, because often they've been
                    observers of what people do, and sometimes that makes you even better at
                    teaching. If you've had an opportunity to observe, to watch how people react,
                    watch how they do well, to watch what they do well, you can put that altogether
                    and put it into some kind of training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how do the officers see that, namely your 25 of
                        experience in the Foreign Service? Do they see you as a spouse in training,
                        or a trainer who happened to be a spouse who sort of... Which way do you
                        think it is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I don't know, Monique, because I've never really asked them, but I think
                    maybe...</p>
                <p>I think - again this goes back to this job business - I think it's interesting. I
                    think in this job they view me more as a colleague. I think maybe in the OBC
                    they viewed me more as a spouse because that seemed to be the focus since we're
                    training so many spouses. We wanted spouses to feel very comfortable with us and
                    know that we were spouses.</p>
                <p>But I think in this job, what I'm doing really does relate to what it means to be
                    an officer and I think that therefore they probably view me much more as a
                    person who's had experience and knows how to put that experience into a training
                    program that meets their interests and needs. I'm not even sure if they think
                    one way or the other if I'm a spouse or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wondered whether they ever thought, oh with the 25
                        years of Foreign Service experience, it's a plus to the training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It would be interesting to know that. I think probably in the area of
                    representational skills, they would think that. Definitely. In fact I think
                    that's pretty much the reaction I get. I don't know in the other areas if that
                    would be their reaction. They may think, since I have not been an officer, that
                    I would not have had direct experience. I just don't know. I've never really,
                    even in my biographic information, I never really explained to them where I got
                    the exposure to what it was like working in an embassy and learning about some
                    of those skills they need.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was never, at least in your experience, it never
                        came into question that, doubting your...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It has come into question, I think, in that, again, I think, there is a
                    reluctance to take seriously, totally seriously, the training of spouses. That
                    it's appropriate for officers as well. I think there is a reluctance there. I
                    think it's a completely inappropriate reluctance, but I think it is there. And I
                    have seen it. Well, just to give you an example in terms of this job, people
                    have said to me, “Oh, now you've got a real job,” which is amazing to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're in the arena with the officers, in other
                        words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. And therefore that makes it more legitimate, which is what I was
                    saying initially, in the world of the bureaucracy, the spouse is always on the
                    outside. And so it's natural that that would be reflected in the environment
                    that trains officers as well. Hopefully it's becoming less that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I hope so!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, hopefully. But I don't know. I think it's very hard for a
                    bureaucracy to incorporate the talents of spouses. In fact, I think with this
                    whole new possibility for work for spouses in the embassy. I think it will be
                    very interesting to see how the embassy chooses to recognize the talents of the
                    pool of spouses who may be interested in getting jobs in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I'm going to get to that in just a moment. Just
                        before, one question. In your perspective, how have the officers changed to
                        you? Say with your experience overseas, and now you're seeing new people
                        coming in. You obviously trained A-100 as well. Have you developed any sort
                        of picture of how they're different over the years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I think one thing, we now see a lot more women. When we first
                    joined the Foreign Service, there were very few women, and if a woman married,
                    she had to resign. So certainly one major area is that there are many more women
                    now. The other thing I've noticed now that I've dealt with so many different
                    classes of incoming officers is that there is tremendous difference in the
                    different classes. Tremendous difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well the personalities, I would say, of the classes now tend to be
                    unpredictable.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, it seems to me. For instance, I worked with a class today that
                    seemed to be much more almost in the mode of the old - not old, but ten years
                    ago - what I might have experienced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More traditional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: More lawyer-oriented. Much more sort of a thinking type of culture.
                    Thinking, not in the terms of thinking - everybody thinks - but in terms of
                    perhaps not as interested in the people angle of diplomatic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More introspective perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: More critical, I would say, than some of the more recent classes I've
                    seen, which seem to not be as critical. Maybe questioning, but not critical.
                    There is a certain characteristic of many Foreign Service officers, and has been
                    for a long, long time, of being extremely critical in their thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of other people, of themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, just the way they think. They're always looking at the issue and
                    wondering what's wrong with it or how it could be improved, or how I'm going to
                    deal with this. You know, give me this information and let me work around it for
                    a long time, and then I'll let you know what I think about it. The more recent
                    classes that I have seen have not been that way. They've been more spontaneous,
                    I would say, more questioning in the sense of almost more humanistic in their
                    approach. And I thought maybe that was a reflection of a real effort to
                    diversify more the body of officers coming in. It could be the fact there's more
                    women coming in. That changes things sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I heard that there was an effort, probably still is
                        an effort, to reach out to other parts of America and other parts of the
                        United States, to other states. What I've heard is that they used to be
                        mostly from the eastern states, from certain schools and so on. Is that your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it's very true. When we first came in, I think we were just
                    beginning to see sort of a turn away from kind of Eastern Establishment. You
                    began to see people coming from other parts of the country, and I think that's
                    much more the case now. I think it's a real diverse group. Except what I notice
                    that's really interesting to me is that it's not diverse in terms of minority
                    representation. It amazes me, and the only thing I can figure is that perhaps
                    minority candidates have other options because I'm always astounded that, after
                    all these years, we still have such a low representation of minority groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you referring to blacks in particular?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, blacks, Hispanics, Asians. It's just a very, very small
                    representation and itreally amazes me. Because I know that there is a desire on
                    the part of the Foreign Service to do this and it's reflected in women,
                    certainly. There are so many more women than there used to be. Still not fifty
                    percent, though. Still probably thirty percent. But in other areas, not as many
                    as I would hope to see for a real representative group. And I think we need
                    that.</p>
                <p>I think that the skills that are required are not the same skills that were
                    required thirty years ago. I think they're very different. I think we need many
                    more people skills now than we ever have before. Maybe we needed them before,
                    too. I don't know. But I think now we need much, much more of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the addition of more women coming into the Service and
                        having representation from other states. How do you think that's going to
                        change the composition of the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You mean the composition in terms of the atmosphere?</p>

                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it's going to be different, and I think it's going to improve
                    things. I think we need more women. Maybe this sounds very sexist, but I think
                    women naturally have, perhaps, or have been encouraged to develop diplomatic
                    skills more than men. I think it's easier for them. I think that women naturally
                    tend to move into negotiation more easily than men. And maybe it goes back to
                    this childhood business we were talking about earlier where women negotiate with
                    each other all the time from the time they're little kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're quite right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, they do it. So it's a natural for them. And I think that we need a
                    lot of that. We need much more than we've had, perhaps. And I think we're going
                    to need more, the way the world's changing. This is another area that's really
                    interesting to me, and the criticisms that I hear from the older school. I hear
                    that there's criticism because the new officers are not as dedicated to their
                    work as the older officers were there. To me this is a very healthy thing.</p>
                <p>I believe in dedication to your job, but dedication to a career, I think, can
                    have some drawbacks. I think in the area of what you strive for, it may be very
                    different. If a person is striving to be number one in his career, how he
                    performs may be very reflective of his superior's desires. And what I see from
                    people who are not so career-oriented. You know, they're very competent and they
                    want to do a fine job, but maybe they don't see the Foreign Service as a career
                    forever. They're not so inclined to always give the response that the supervisor
                    wants. I think they may be more interested, at times, in changing the
                    perspective on an issue. And I think that's very healthy. But I think there is
                    talk that that's a problem in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you mentioned already that, as we have more women
                        officers, we're going to see more male spouses. Could you tell me a little
                        bit more about how you see that? I don't know quite how to put it, but just
                        having male spouses and also, obviously, women are going to have to find
                        partners also, and if they are devoted to a career in the Foreign Service,
                        are they all going to end up marrying Foreign Service officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Interesting question. I think, first of all, male spouses in the Foreign
                    Service is a very healthy thing. I think that males in our society are used to
                    getting what they want and I think you're going to see a much more active fight
                    for employment, for example, when there's male spouses who are concerned about
                    getting jobs than you've seen from female spouses. Again, not because we don't
                    want jobs, but we are not used to tearing down the palace gates, and men are.
                    Men go in and if things aren't the way they want, they change them.</p>
                <p>And I don't think we have been that aggressive. I think we're going to see
                    spouses' needs certainly made more readily apparent because of that. I think
                    we're already seeing some of that. I think that perhaps women who are in the
                    Foreign Service... I think that some women, just like some men, decide that
                    that's what they want to do with their lives. They want to make it a career. And
                    marriage may be peripheral to that decision. They may decide that, to them, a
                    family and marriage are not important. The most important thing for them is
                    their career. There are men who have decided the same thing. And I'm not sure
                    with women if it's going to be much more different than it is with men in terms
                    of numbers.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I don't know as far as marrying other Foreign Service people. It's complicated.
                    It's complicated for anybody who is that devoted to her career to marry another
                    person in the same career because one of those members is going to have to
                    sacrifice, because the tandem system does not work splendidly, brilliantly. It
                    just doesn't. And I think with that as a given, it's going to be hard for two
                    very career-oriented, very achievement-oriented individuals to find if that
                    works real well for them. If you don't have that situation. If you have a
                    situation where one is very willing to take jobs as they come, then I think it's
                    work beautifully, if that's the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many tandem couples have you seen in your Foreign
                        Service career? Just roughly, five, ten, fifteen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I'm just trying to think. At least ten, I would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wanted to get some sense of what numbers we're
                        talking about, that's all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I don't know. There are actually figures on exactly how many there are
                    now. There's quite a few. But I've only encountered, I guess, about ten. And the
                    interesting thing to me is that almost invariably there was some problem as a
                    result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. It's built into the system. And again, that's not to discourage
                    people from becoming tandems, but I can think of only one case where it seems to
                    have worked extremely smoothly. And in that case both parties had felt very
                    comfortable with taking a job that was not perhaps career-enhancing, but gave
                    them a good school for their kids, a place they wanted to live, and both a
                    decent job. I think both of them early on decided their priorities were things
                    rather than career-enhancement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I'm wondering now is the relationship between
                        officers and spouses. How they treat each other overseas, especially
                        overseas at the mission, because you're there together in the same place
                        much more so than when you're back here in Washington, DC. Would you tell me
                        a little bit more about that? In your experience, the statuses of officers
                        and spouses and how they relate to each other in general or in some specific
                        situations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I think that basically spouses have been treated as somewhat
                    second-class citizens. I think, in a way, they have been looked upon as being
                    just a cut above the children. (laughs) I mean that sounds really dreadful and
                    many people may disagree with me, but I've viewed this for a number of years and
                    I've talked to a lot of people and I've heard a lot of comments that maybe
                    people didn't want me to hear. And I think that, unfortunately, there is a
                    condescending attitude toward spouses. Even toward professional spouses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from the officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Coming from the officers. I think they are viewed as interference to a
                    certain degree. You know, spouses when they go overseas are left with a lot of
                    the administrative work. Many spouses do most of the administrative work. I've
                    never done that because I've always felt that was a loser. There was no way I
                    could ever win with that one, so I've stayed out of it. My husband was moving me
                    around, and my feeling was, since he was doing that, it was his job to set all
                    the administrative parts. Except for one occasion when I got very involved and
                    it was not good.</p>
                <p>And it isn't good. It's a mess. Many spouses handle all of the administrative
                    stuff and the administrative section doesn't like to see them coming because
                    they know they're going to bring with them problems. More questions, more
                    demands. If it comes from an officer, there's a different attitude. It's very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're talking about things regarding the household or
                        getting an ID? That sort of administrative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. The general administrative details that have to be handled. When
                    they're handled by the officer, it's viewed as part of the job. Often when it's
                    the spouse it's viewed as interference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And complaints.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: And complaints. It's very difficult because, as I said, the spouse is
                    left with so much of this and also with the desire to get things right, to get
                    things in order, whether it's with the children, with the transportation,
                    whatever. You get very frustrated sometimes as a spouse when you can't get your
                    housing lined up, or whatever. And when you feel like there's no support coming
                    to you from the embassy, it's very frustrating. And if you go and start
                    complaining about it, then you get labeled as a complainer. So it's hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sounds terrible, actually. Let's focus a little bit
                        on how women officers relate to women spouses. I'm thinking that probably in
                        your experience, again, you encountered more women spouses than male
                        spouses. How do you think they relate to each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think, unfortunately, a lot of that opinion they have adopted as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I was afraid of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Just as an example, a recent comment that I heard in one of my
                    presentations on protocol and representation abroad from an officer was that she
                    was concerned about dressing up for cocktail parties because she didn't want to
                    be mistaken for a spouse. And I think, unfortunately, there is that sense that
                    spouses are not official members of the community. And people wouldn't want to
                    be mistaken for somebody who's not official and doesn't have any power or
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because she was talking about being mistaken as a spouse
                        by outside people. And so what we're saying is that the attitude on spouses
                        extends outside the American mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: That's right. That they are perhaps peripheral. I think that the place
                    that we miss out here is that spouses do play a very large part in influencing
                    their employee spouse. Other societies know that and they go a long ways, I
                    think, toward educating their spouses, to making sure that even they're paid at
                    times, so that they will attend functions. Because they know how important the
                    spouses can be in facilitating dialogue with the people who work in the embassy.
                    There's absolutely no question about it.</p>
                <p>But I don't think that people have ever really recognized that with our spouses.
                    Now maybe that's not true. Maybe going back to the olden days... It's
                    interesting because I think spouses from the olden days, meaning olden days like
                    when my husband and I started in the Foreign Service. I think going back that
                    far, if you'd asked spouses, they would have felt they had a very, very
                    important role to play. And in fact when the '72 Directive came out, many of
                    them were very resentful because they felt their role was so important. So it
                    may have been over the last ten to fifteen years that the attitude toward
                    spouses had become... you know, the role is much less clearly defined. And it
                    may be that this is where this attitude is developing. I don't know. It's a very
                    interesting question to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm still very unsettled with this question regarding how
                        women officers treat women spouses. That just sounds very discouraging to
                        me.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I don't think it's everybody. I don't think it's everybody, but I
                    have to say that generally speaking, I think it is true. I'd kind of like to ask
                    the officers themselves. There are a number of spouses who have been spouses who
                    are joining the Foreign Service. I know some of the people who have done this,
                    and even their attitude, in many cases, changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They now look at themselves as more an officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. It's fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have experienced that, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: So I think it's a problem. And this is a place where, if you had a
                    certain type of training, you might be able to change the attitudes of officers.
                    That would be a wonderful accomplishment if you could do that, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since we're on the subject of the mission overseas, how
                        about the question of how the status of a spouse changes as the officer
                        moves up the rank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: How that changes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How does that change for the spouse, and also how
                        does that change for other people, perhaps, looking at you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Right. It's really an interesting question, Monique. I'm very interested
                    in the psychology of that and in fact, at some point, I would really like to
                    study that because it really fascinates me. Because I've noticed in discussions
                    with spouses I know, there are very different attitudes around this. And I've
                    always got this little tape recorder going in my head that picks up different
                    comments because I think it's just fascinating to see.</p>
                <p>There are obviously a number of spouses that view themselves as part and parcel
                    of the officer. And in that case I think they are extremely sensitive to the
                    career advancement because for them, the advancement reflects on them. If their
                    officer husband or wife gets a promotion, they get the promotion as well. This
                    never struck me, to tell you truth, until I started working at the OBC. I never
                    realized this. Because I have never felt that. I have never felt - for some
                    reason - I don't know why it is - but I had never felt that my husband's success
                    or lack of success had anything to do with me in any way. I always felt like I
                    was very fortunate to be able to go along for the ride in all of this, that it
                    was a great opportunity, that I learned a lot. But I never felt that anything
                    that he did had anything to do with me.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even before the '72 Directive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, even before. I didn't understand all this. I don't know. I think
                    that I was very naive coming into the Foreign Service. I had lived in a family
                    where status was never discussed. It was just not an issue at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are you and that's it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. And I didn't realize that people had all these issues around
                    status. I had just never been exposed to that or never thought about it. So it
                    never occurred to me, even prior to '72, I couldn't even understand what the big
                    stink was. I didn't understand this, really, why a person would care one way or
                    another. I didn't see why they'd want to talk about me in my husband's EER. On
                    the other hand, I couldn't see, when it was gone, what difference that made
                    either. So I was kind of out in left field. It's weird.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, it's really interesting that I was. It really wasn't until I
                    started working at the OBC that I had any consciousness of any of this. When I
                    started hearing people discussing work and status and all that stuff. And so I
                    have to say that up until I went to Argentina, I really was not conscious
                    whether anybody in any way treated me differently or the same or not as well as
                    I should have been treated, or whatever, because of our rank. Because to me that
                    was immaterial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your husband was DCM (deputy chief of mission) in
                        Argentina.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, so it wasn't until we went there, after I'd been at the OBC, that I
                    began to think a little bit about this. Because I heard so many people's
                    comments, you know? And I began to think that I guessed it was a pretty
                    important deal, after all, if that happened.</p>
                <p>And that concerned me, too, because I wasn't sure whether I liked having any sort
                    of additional expectation around me. I guess that basically I don't like people
                    to have expectations of me that I haven't established for myself. So that was my
                    inclination I was going to have to someway, at least in my head, realize that I
                    would arrive and people would have certain expectations of me. So the OBC was a
                    big help in that in that they were training people to be DCMs and DCMs' spouses.
                    So I realized there was an issue here that I had to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were training yourself then? (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I started sort of training myself and thinking, “Well, gosh, what
                    will they expect?” and all that business. And again I think I'm probably not
                    very good at this because I find it very difficult to know in advance what other
                    people's expectations are going to be. I think that it's hard to ever set that
                    up. Because once you start setting that up, then you start putting yourself in a
                    certain category to fulfill the expectations that you have established
                    yourself.</p>
                <p>So I think my decision was to go there, basically, and see what was up and what
                    was needed, and that's pretty much what I did. And I think that looking back on
                    it, people did expect certain things of me. People did make friends with me
                    because of who my husband was in some cases. That's true. That happens. And I
                    know now that that kind of thing happens. But that's life, that's the way it is,
                    and I think you again just have to roll with the punches on that and realize
                    that that's the way it is.</p>
                <p>And a lot of good comes out of that, too, and you just have to appreciate the
                    good that comes out of it and disregard the other part. Particularly if people
                    are making friends with you only because they think that your husband is in a
                    particular position, that your spouse is something special. I would have to say
                    it definitely bothered me to think that I was expected to perform in a way
                    different from what I had ever been expected to perform before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned not liking the expectations that other
                        people put onto you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It's not so much, Monique, that I don't like it. I realize that's human
                    nature. It's not that. I guess what I really don't like is when I establish my
                    agenda based on other people's expectations. I understand everybody has
                    expectations, but I think when you start planning your life according to other
                    people's expectations, you get into a trap. That's something that I hope I never
                    do. So I guess in that sense, it's helpful to know what the expectations might
                    be, but I think you also always have to be open because you might be wrong about
                    what people really expect and how you can do the most. I think that you have to
                    decide for yourself how you can do the most good wherever you are. And it may
                    have nothing to do with anybody's expectations but your own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. How about comparing for me for a moment here
                        your experience as the DCM's wife in Buenos Aires, Argentina and your
                        experience at your first post when your husband first started in Gabon.</hi>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Oh, in Gabon, yes. Well, again, this is interesting to me because I went
                    out to Gabon not knowing anything about the Foreign Service, not caring anything
                    about the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were newly married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Newly married. We'd just been married two weeks. My only knowledge of
                    the Foreign Service was from two people I'd met on a train traveling from Munich
                    to Stuttgart who were in the Foreign Service - this was back in 1960, I think -
                    and I thought it was the Foreign Legion for all I knew. I had no concept. We had
                    never known anybody who had worked for the government. My father was an adamant
                    businessman and thought very lowly of the government, had never known anybody
                    who worked for the government, had never had any interest in knowing anybody who
                    worked for the government, and couldn't believe I'd marry somebody who worked
                    for the government!</p>
                <p>So when I went out, I thought, “Well, that's okay. I don't care. Government
                    sounds okay to me. We're going to travel around and have a good time.” So I went
                    out really not having the foggiest idea of what the Foreign Service even meant.
                    And I think in a way that was really great because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was typical of other couples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I don't think so. That's the funny thing, Monique, I really don't think
                    so. I don't know, maybe California in those days was just really remote.
                    (laughter) Washington was so far away, people didn't talk about Washington. They
                    weren't interested in politics, even, much in those days. And the Foreign
                    Service was the last thing anybody thought about.</p>
                <p>My parents traveled a lot and we traveled a lot, but I never thought in terms of
                    people joining a government agency and traveling around with that government
                    agency. It never even occurred to me that anyone would do thaSo I didn't know
                    anything about it. I just knew that we were going to go to Gabon when we got
                    married, and that would be great. I think my husband tried to explain it to me a
                    little bit, but I really wasn't too interested in learning about it. But we got
                    there and I got a job in the embassy almost immediately. A wonderful job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I was representative for the African-American Institute.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. So I think I almost immediately got a very different perspective,
                    maybe from other people because I was immersed in the business of the embassy,
                    trying to do things with a foreign government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were lucky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I was so fortunate. I think for me it helped me create an idea of the
                    possibilities in the Foreign Service that maybe some people didn't have. When I
                    first went, there were a lot of unhappy people, a lot of spouses who did nothing
                    but drink tea all day. That was okay, but I was just fortunate that I happened
                    to get this wonderful job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as a young spouse, how were you perceived? Do you
                        remember anything specific that struck you one way or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I'll tell you one thing was, we had a really wonderful ambassador. He
                    was very old school in a way in that he was very formal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Baine, David Baine. But a real gentleman, first class gentleman, and
                    regarded everybody with the utmost respect. And so I think it never occurred to
                    me that I was a little underling spouse because he never treated anybody like
                    that. Everybody was important to him. And his wife as well. She never put
                    anybody down, never announced any requirements of anybody. Never expected
                    anybody to do anything they didn't want to. So I think that they were unique in
                    that regard.</p>
                <p>In fact, the embassy had a boat that supposedly we were supposed to use for
                    evacuation. And we had a beach house eleven miles on the other side of the
                    estuary. Well, the boat just happened to be for water-skiing and the estuary
                    just happened to be like glass most of the time. It was perfect for
                    water-skiing. And the beach house was located on this gorgeous white sand beach.
                    It was perfect. And the ambassador would ask different people to go over across
                    on the estuary every weekend with him and rotate it so that everybody had a
                    chance all the time to do it. So I think that my experience was really unique.
                    It was really wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got to do it, too? Even on your first tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Sure, we did it all the time. He would call up Sunday morning and say,
                    “This is David and would you like to go with us over to spend the day at the
                    other side?” So we'd all go water-skiing together and have a wonderful time.
                    There was never any discussion of people's rank or anything else. That just
                    never entered into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't conscious of that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, I wasn't conscious of it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how was it in Argentina, looking from the DCM
                        position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I think certainly as far as we were concerned it was again not an
                    issue at all. I certainly think that for myself and for my husband, we are not
                    concerned in any way about rank except that we want to make sure that people who
                    are in the embassy all feel included as best we can. We're not people, I think,
                    who are real interested in doing a whole lot of socializing in a big group. We
                    love one on one, small dinners and things like that, but we don't like a lot of
                    big functions where we have to entertain a lot of people. And I certainly think
                    that we are not in any way conscious at all or interested in rank except as it
                    applies to protocol where you have to consider it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. But there's a certain amount of probably fairness
                        that you and husband have to be sure to exercise because you have certain
                        authority and responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: That's true. And I think that's very difficult. I think it requires, for
                    one thing, a real commitment from the ambassador you're working with to make
                    sure that you can carry that out. It's really important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, since you mentioned about ambassadors and I'm just
                        recalling that you are involved with training ambassadors and DCMs a little
                        bit. Am I correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, not really. Not in this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through OBC?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, when I was at OBC I did. But that's been 1990, I guess, was the
                    last time I did any of that. Although I did do a program on a contract before I
                    was hired for this position here when I came back from Argentina. I did a
                    program for DCMs on protocol and representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than protocol and representation, what are the major
                        points of training ambassadors' wives or spouses as well as DCMs and DCMs'
                        spouses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I think there's very set programs for the ambassadors and I think
                    it's a very good program. What they do is they bring them in and they have a
                    two-week program. They have pretty much delineated the things that they feel are
                    the most important for ambassadors to know. They mix up the career people with
                    the non-career, and that's intentional so that the non-career get a chance to
                    hear from the career people.</p>
                <p>What they try to do is introduce everybody to the way an embassy operates. How
                    it's different being head of the mission from being in any other job in the
                    mission. How the chief of mission is responsible and relates to all the other
                    elements in the embassy. You've got all these other agencies now that have
                    representatives. The military, DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency,) AID. It's just so
                    huge now, very complex. They talk a lot about that.</p>
                <p>They do quite a bit about work with the press, spending time here at FSI and
                    assisting people in making speeches, and how they handle the press, how they
                    relate to it. They introduce them to various agencies around the city: the CIA
                    (Central Intelligence Agency) and other agencies that may relate to the work
                    that they do overseas.</p>
                <p>For the spouses, they take them for a two-day program and on that they talk a lot
                    about the expectations and ambassadors' spouses setting their own agendas and
                    how they go about that and their relation to people in the mission. And they
                    talk about representation, the responsibilities they have, and how they go about
                    doing all the accounts, all the administrative work connected with that.</p>
                <p>The DCMs have a two-week program as well. Half of that is off-site and they
                    discuss what it means to work for a chief of mission and, I think, do a lot of
                    work around team-building which is very important, and their work as supervisors
                    particularly in helping the junior officers in the embassy to make sure that
                    they're getting career advice and that kind of thing. And they do some things
                    with the spouses. They do Myers-Briggs [personality tests], for example, and a
                    little bit around representational functions, again about expectations.</p>

                        whose spouses are the officers in the higher level, more senior positions.
                        If those spouses are to work in the embassy, does that present a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think it presents real problems, particularly for some jobs. And
                    particularly when jobs are limited. Yes, I think it can. There are certain
                    regulations, for example, that require a spouse not to be supervised by a
                    spouse. In other words, if I were going to be CLO and my husband were
                    administrative officer, he could not supervise me. It would be probably not a
                    good idea to even think of doing that. I think as the spouse of a DCM it's
                    difficult.</p>

                <p>FORBORD: I didn't. But I wasn't there very long either because my husband went
                    ahead of me. Since we had a senior in high school, I stayed with her to
                    graduate. I think eventually I probably would have found something to do, but
                    probably outside the embassy. I would have felt much more comfortable with that.
                    And I think for an ambassador's spouse it's extremely difficult.</p>

                <p>FORBORD: It does, Monique, but a lot of it, I think, would be choice. I think if
                    I had been working in the embassy I might have felt like everything was so
                    intensified, everything being right there. I don't know. It's a difficult
                    question. Again, it depends on the kind of work that would come up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that actually a DCM's spouse or an
                        ambassador's spouse have time to have a career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think that they can make time for themselves. Again, remember, they're
                    not employees. It's up to them. I think if they perceive themselves as being
                    welded to their employee spouse... I don't mean to sound... Maybe it sounds like
                    I'm berating that. I'm not. I think that some spouses view one career as enough
                    and they're perfectly happy to promote that career in any way that they can.
                    Other people are not as happy doing that. If you're not happy doing that, I
                    think it would be very hard to do only the job of enhancement of the employee's
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not fulfilling for the spouse.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, for some people it is. It depends on the person. Some people are
                    extremely fulfilled by it. I have friends who think it's just the most wonderful
                    thing in the world and I think it's great if they get that much satisfaction out
                    of it. And if they decide to do that, it can become a full-time job. You can
                    spend your time organizing really important functions, making sure that
                    everything's perfect. On the other hand, you also have a staff to do that, and
                    if your staff is good and you're fortunate, you may be able to use your staff to
                    do that.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of wonderful things that a spouse can do in terms of volunteer work
                    in the community because of the contacts you have. You may have entr�s that you
                    wouldn't have otherwise. And I would see, if I were in that position, I think
                    maybe what I would look for would be something like that. I think there would be
                    fantastic opportunities for you to do work in the community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's focus for a little while on the topic of
                        representation and protocol here, Nancy, since you do ongoing training in
                        this area. Two questions. One is, again get back to the question of having a
                        lot of male spouses. How does that affect the representation responsibility?
                        And the other is just, what is the single most important thing that you want
                        to get across to Foreign Service families on the topic of protocol and
                        representation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, first of all, I would say as far as the male spouses, I think you
                    need to sit down and clarify in your own mind whose responsibility it is. I
                    think it's the responsibility of the employee to represent the U.S. abroad. I
                    think that is the job. And as an employee, I think you have to decide how best
                    to do that. If you determine the best way to do that is through building
                    relationships at post with people of the host government, other diplomats,
                    members of your own mission, then I think you're going to have to have to decide
                    probably that you need to do some representational entertaining in order to
                    promote that.</p>
                <p>At that point, it seems to me that if your spouse is interested in assisting you
                    in that, there's a lot to be helped with and it's great if you've got a spouse
                    who wants to do that because you probably can do a lot better job if you have
                    two hands instead of one. I don't think it matters if it's a male or a female.
                    If the male spouse is anxious to assist, it can be just as successful. There are
                    a lot of male spouses who have wonderful social skills and like to cook, like to
                    entertain, and can do all that.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>If neither one of you likes to do it, you might want to hire somebody to do it.
                    If you look at the Queen of England, the Queen of England doesn't do these
                    parties herself, she hires somebody to plan these wonderful parties. We seem to
                    have a reluctance to realize that we can, if we want to, hire somebody to assist
                    us with that. And I think that's the reality if you choose to work instead of
                    putting time into those things, you may want to consider that you want someone
                    to assist you. And people can do that. I know many single ambassadors do that.
                    They hire a person who acts like sort of a social organizer and organizes things
                    like that for them, and it's a wonderful system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But doesn't that bring up the question that spouses are
                        doing things and they're not getting paid, and then when the ambassador
                        hires somebody, the person is getting paid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well they are, they are. It's true. But I think, you see, it's the
                    spouse's choice. The spouse doesn't have to do that. Nobody says, “You're the
                    spouse. Therefore we're going to expect a lot more of your spouse employee
                    because he or she's got you there.” Q: So one important point that you want to
                    get across is that it is the responsibility of the employee to entertain.</p>
                <p>FORBORD: Exactly. I think it is. I think it's the responsibility of the employee.
                    I believe, since that employee agrees to represent the U.S. government and
                    agrees to basically promote socialization and promote relationship-building
                    abroad, that I think it is the job of the employee. Just like if that employee
                    were hired by a company to go over and promote the sale of a product, you can't
                    do that sitting in your office. It's not going to sell.</p>
                <p>And I think that sometimes Foreign Service officers, because they are so
                    interested in the issues, get very involved in that aspect, almost the academic
                    type work, and forget that a lot of what they do has to do with people. And it's
                    not to say that you have to go out and entertain elegantly or formally or
                    anything. But you need to get out and meet people, however best you can do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the officers are gradually getting the
                        message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I hope. (laughter) I give them that message. I think they are. I think
                    they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a difference in view between women officers and
                        men officers in this regard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>FORBORD: It's very interesting. A lot of the questions that I get from the women
                    officers regard how many fancy things they should take with them. They've got
                    them, they say. They like to entertain. “And how much should I take with me?”
                    And I don't generally hear that from the men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do they say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: They don't say much. (laughs) Or they say they'd like to bring their
                    spouse along to hear this presentation. Very often they say that. So I think
                    they assume that it's the women's job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's the women's job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: But not all of them. We had a really interesting discussion, in fact,
                    around dress one day in the class. There was this talk about how fancy a female
                    officer can go to a function and people will still take her seriously, which is
                    interesting to me. And the men, almost to every man there, said that the way the
                    woman dresses, I mean as long as it's not extremely, I guess you would say,
                    extreme, that would have nothing to do with the way they would take her
                    seriously or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what they say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: But maybe they would, yes. Maybe they would. Who knows? You're right.
                    But they were very surprised that that came up as an issue from the female
                    officers. Very interesting discussion. But I think I would just say that you can
                    have a lot of fun entertaining and meeting people overseas. And I would say
                    rather than entertaining, I would like to say meeting people overseas. I think
                    if a spouse decides that he or she is not going to participate at all, you miss
                    out on a great opportunity to meet people overseas. It's a wonderful way. And
                    people want to meet you. And where else do you go in the world where they really
                    are dying to meet you, you know? It doesn't happen very often. I mean I can go
                    out here and no one cares! (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. That could be why people find it very
                        difficult coming back to Washington, DC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think that's a lot of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're so anonymous here. Looking at the postings you had
                        it seems regular. You had one overseas post and one DC post. I'm just
                        curious as to how you and your husband decide on your postings. Was it a
                        conscious decision that you want to be back in DC every so often?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, it really wasn't like that. A lot of it was just circumstance. I
                    think it has been extremely fortunate that we have had it that way. When we were
                    talking about children earlier, I think our children have a great sense of being
                    from Washington, both of our children. If you ask them where they're from,
                    they'll tell anybody they're from Washington. They feel this is home. They feel
                    a great affinity. They definitely feel like they're Americans. There is no
                    question in my children's' minds that they're Americans. They love America. They
                    love being an American. They think it's a wonderful advantage. A lot of Foreign
                    Service children don't feel that way. I think a lot of Foreign Service children
                    have not had the opportunity to really experience life in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sometimes they were gone for nine years or more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Forever. Some of them don't come back until they go to college. And our
                    children, I think because we came and went and came and went, there was a
                    certain reliability, too. They saw their friends again and we'd leave and we'd
                    come back and we'd see their friends again. And there was a consistency, I
                    think, that helped them. But that was chance. We really did not plan that. The
                    only plan we had was when we came back from Australia. We really planned
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well having done that, experienced that by chance, would
                        you recommend that to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I would definitely recommend it, no question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Try to be back in DC every so often.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I would recommend against, if you have a choice, ever staying out. Many
                    parents do, and I think it's an unfortunate thing. I've talked to so many about
                    this and I don't usually comment on it because I can understand what their
                    thinking is. Many parents find it much easier to have children overseas than in
                    the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How so?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Because they don't have the independence they have here. It's different.
                    Overseas they live in a protected community. You can let them do things on their
                    own and not worry about it. They're independent, but not really. They feel like
                    they're independent, but they really aren't. Decisions are made for them,
                    they're taken care of, their needs are met, they live usually in very
                    comfortable circumstances, they often have help in the house. It's really quite
                    a nice lifestyle.</p>
                <p>It has been up to now. I don't know if it's going to continue with housing
                    getting smaller and all of that business, but it has been. And the school is
                    small. It's like going to a private school. Parents think they're doing their
                    kids a favor. And I think for the parents it's much easier. I don't think
                    there's any question. It is much easier.</p>
                <p>And they will avoid coming back to Washington. They say, “We go back to
                    Washington and we don't have as nice a house. We can't afford to send the kids
                    to private school. They're going to want to drive. They're going to want to get
                    out in that dangerous city and move around. We can't let them do that.” So they
                    don't have them come back.</p>
                <p>And I think the result of that is they never feel like they belong in the United
                    States. They don't feel like this is home, they don't feel like they can relate
                    to it. They may not have developed the independence that they need to have to
                    operate in this society. And I think it's extremely hard on the kids. The ones
                    that I have seen...</p>
                <p>It's an interesting thing to me because on the surface they may appear to be
                    sophisticated. They're very appealing to adults because they can be articulate.
                    They can talk to adults. They don't seem to even be interested in a lot of the
                    things other kids are interested in. But I think it takes a great toll on them
                    inside. I really think so.</p>
                <p>And I think if you talk to kids who have been through this, they'll tell you
                    that. That coming back to the U.S., particularly if they come back to start
                    college, is so hard on them. They never feel like they belong. That's why you've
                    got this group like the Global Nomads who get together and they talk because
                    they've never felt like they belong. And it's not to say they don't offer other
                    things to society, but I think it's at a great price. I think the kids pay a
                    huge, huge price for that.</p>

                    very different experience. I mean even the one bad experience, which I would say
                    was Australia, that we had, and that had nothing to do really basically with the
                    country or the embassy. The people at the embassy were lovely. It was just the
                    time wasn't right for us. We've had fabulous postings. I just can't imagine it
                    could have been any better than it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if you were to make a list now for somebody else
                        coming into the Foreign Service of the things that one should consider in
                        deciding on a post...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You know it's really interesting. I've thought a lot about this since
                    our discussion prior to this interview. One of the drawbacks, I think, of all
                    this planning that we all encourage might be that people are a little too
                    careful sometimes. I don't think any of these posts we actually picked. It's
                    strange. Not really picked. Either my husband was asked to go there for a
                    specific reason or something. Except in the case of Australia where I would
                    really, really suggest people check out the schools. And I would suggest you be
                    extremely careful when your children are teenagers about any kind of moving. I
                    guess that would be my recommendation.</p>
                <p>Other than that, I would say don't try to find the perfect post because I don't
                    think it works like that. I think a lot of it is luck. I think of it as a spirit
                    of adventure. Being willing to go and take some risks maybe. You know, try some
                    things you would never have tried otherwise. Kind of roll with the punches a
                    little bit and just be willing to be open to whatever comes.</p>
                <p>I think I would be a little careful maybe in terms of health. Right now, for
                    example, I would be a little worried about going to some places in Africa
                    because of malaria. When we were in Gabon we had an experience with malaria and
                    with another tropical disease, and I have to say that, again, we've been very
                    lucky. We could have been very sick. That certainly would change your
                    experience. But for us, we've just been incredibly fortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Health seems like a big problem at times because it's
                        something that you carry back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: That's right. It can haunt you for so long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not going to go away once you've got it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>FORBORD: There are some places now I'd be real afraid to go. I'd be really,
                    really careful and cautious, I think, and maybe not go because of that. I don't
                    think I'd ever be worried about... I would maybe be worried about security. I
                    maybe would be worried about health, and, if I had children, education. I don't
                    think the other things, like employment, I would be worried about. You know I
                    love to work, but to me that's a somewhat peripheral issue because I feel like
                    there is always something you can do that will enrich your life. That's what
                    I've found. And I think if I had limited myself only to places where I could get
                    a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting, because I think that probably you
                        would hear a lot of people say that they would find a post where the spouse
                        can work, has a bilateral agreement, de facto agreement and so on. Something
                        that they know the spouse can do for sure. That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I would be much more inclined to look for an interesting culture, nice
                    climate. (laughs)I think I would be reluctant to go to Moscow, even though it'd
                    be a fascinating place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's cold.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I know about myself. It's hard for me to enjoy when it's cold. So I
                    think at this age I've decided there are certain things in my life that are very
                    important to me and one thing is being warm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. I think you just said to think about
                        what is you and what is not you. You and your spouse, of course, and your
                        family. What is not suitable is not something that somebody else can decide
                        for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Absolutely. You can't. You know what you like to do, you know what makes
                    your life happy. If you can't do those things... For example, if I had to go
                    someplace right now where I couldn't have telephone contact with my kids at this
                    age, that would just make my life miserable. I don't care. I think even if
                    everything else were perfect, if I could not have contact with them on a regular
                    basis, it just wouldn't be worth it to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you're saying, though, it seems like, these needs
                        change over time and so every time you're faced with a decision to go
                        somewhere, you have to re-evaluate again the needs of your family, interests
                        and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>FORBORD: Definitely. I think that's exactly what you have to do. And I don't
                    think in the Foreign Service you can make long-term plans because you never know
                    what's going to happen next with your life! (laughter) And you never know what
                    opportunity might come knocking. You've sort of got to be ready for it if it
                    comes, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nancy, I'd like your views on the foreign-born spouses. We
                        have talked about this a little bit in other contexts in conversations. I've
                        heard that people mention foreign-born spouses are going to change the face
                        of the Foreign Service. Is that an image that the United States wants
                        overseas? Having all the different nationalities of spouses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: You see, unfortunately, it goes back to this lack of consideration for
                    spouses, period. I don't think the bureaucracy is capable of that kind of
                    thinking, unfortunately. I think if they were, they could use the richness of
                    Foreign Service spouses. I don't think they're capable of that. I don't think
                    they ever sit down and say, “What kind of a face do we want to present to the
                    rest of the world?” If they had done that a long time ago, they would have done
                    a lot more for the Foreign Service family than they have done. And “they” is
                    really “us.” We are the Foreign Service. We determine what we're going to do
                    down the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I'm thinking in particular when, say, a foreign-born
                        spouse... The criticism I've heard is, “How can you represent the United
                        States if you haven't lived in the United States? If you don't speak English
                        well? Is that an image that we want to present to the rest of the
                        world?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: But you don't represent the United States. I mean, technically. Again,
                    it's your spouse, it's the employee who does that. I think you do in that you go
                    along with the employee, your family goes along. But I think to force that
                    responsibility on a spouse is really not quite right. I think the United States
                    is a country that is fluid enough in our development. Certainly right now. We
                    are culturally so dynamic that I think this is just representative of our
                    culture. It seems to me that it's a perfect representation of what's going on in
                    the United States, so I think it's ideal. That would never even occur to me,
                    Monique. That's an interesting question because that never would have in any way
                    occurred to me.</p>
                <p>The only place that I would be concerned about foreign-born spouses would be for
                    them in the event of an evacuation and a safe haven. Other than that, I view
                    Foreign Service spouses just like I view all the other people in the United
                    States, as coming from all different kinds of backgrounds. I think it's great.
                    And I think that, as far as our government's concerned, we're very lucky that we
                    have that. Again, I just don't know whether or not the Foreign Service ever
                    recognizes how fortunate it is to have families to help represent the U.S.
                    overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. What I'm hearing is the very clear
                        distinction that the employee is the person who is hired to represent the
                        United States. I think it's not often articulated in such clear terms.
                        Sometimes perhaps even spouses confuse themselves that they are assigned to
                        be responsible for what goes on in the employees' work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes. I think they are confused, and I think that maybe to a certain
                    extent that has been a benefit for the Foreign Service that they are confused. I
                    think they've done an awful lot. Contributed so much. And many spouses would
                    totally disagree with me on this. I'll tell you, Monique. I know that. Many of
                    them feel as though, again, the spouse is as much a representative. I have to
                    look at the way the regulations are written, and according to the regulations,
                    the spouse has absolutely no responsibility at all. Now in the case of anything
                    going wrong, it will certainly reflect on the employee, and that's a
                    reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's unfortunate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: And that's unfortunate. And the employee may suffer as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you think about it from a slightly different angle, you
                        would think that of course whatever you do often reflects on your family, on
                        everybody you know, so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: It's like that. That's how I would look upon it. But I think my
                    viewpoint might be slightly different from other people's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what was the single most difficult challenge that you
                        have faced in the last twenty-five years you've had? Have you ever thought
                        of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Gosh, the single most difficult challenge. I suppose probably that
                    decision to leave Australia because it was a decision that could have lead us to
                    separation. If my husband had been forced to stay or give up his career, I don't
                    know if he would have stayed or not. He may not have. But it would have forced
                    us into a decision that would have been extremely difficult. And as it was, we
                    were just so lucky that it worked out okay for us.</p>
                <p>I would say in my life probably the most challenging thing I've ever faced was
                    raising teenagers. (laughs) That doesn't have a whole lot to do with the Foreign
                    Service. I think that's just a reality of the responsibility of raising
                    teenagers. The most challenging and rewarding.</p>
                <p>In the Foreign Service, I can't think of anything except for that period when it
                    was difficult because it required a major decision. But looking back on it, it
                    was great, you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the funniest story you ever had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Oh, well, Gabon is loaded with funny stories. There are just so many of
                    them from Gabon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some romanticism from the first post? People
                        often say that the first post was the best and the most romantic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I don't think so. I think it was just a series of characters who were
                    there, kind of the time of our life. There were just so many things that
                    happened. I think being in a small post. Mostly young people there. We had a big
                    turnover. When we first went to Gabon, it was a retirement post and most people
                    were really old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: And we thought, in fact, “Oh, my gosh, we're never going to fit in
                    here.” Because they were all old and we were real young. But then within six
                    months, everybody turned over and we were all real young. We just had a lot of
                    really funny things happen there. It's hard to put my finger on one thing that
                    was more humorous than another. Even just the place that we lived, which was
                    right on the water. It was an old apartment called the “Hugo Building.” And it
                    was just kind of dilapidated. There were just so many funny things.</p>
                <p>Just for an example. There were six apartments. And five of them were occupied.
                    The sixth apartment was on the ground floor and was reserved for happy hour on
                    Fridays. So that was the only time we used it. We got movies that would come in
                    on these big old-fashioned movie reels. They would go from post to post in
                    Africa. And we'd get them every Friday if we were lucky, they'd come in. And
                    sometimes six or seven horrible movies would arrive. But Friday nights they
                    would have movies at this happy hour place. Several funny things were connected
                    with that. One thing was, this apartment had been inhabited by somebody with a
                    dog previously. And it was absolutely loaded with fleas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: And everybody - like everybody meaning even the Peace Corps volunteers -
                    there might be a hundred people there in this apartment. We'd all be there ready
                    for the movie. And people would be sitting on the furniture and as the evening
                    went on, everybody would jump out of the furniture because they were being
                    bitten by all these fleas. That was one thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>And then I remember one night when the movies were on and there was a Peace Corps
                    volunteer who was up country who had adopted a baby chimp. And this chimp became
                    quite famous, by the way. He eventually ended up in the Zoo in San Diego. But
                    this Peace Corps volunteer adopted the chimp as a child, not as a chimp, and
                    clothed him in all this clothing. And I remember one night, the first time I
                    ever saw the chimp. Everybody was sitting on the floor watching these movies and
                    the lights were off, and you could just see the lights from the reflection of
                    the projector. And I remember I had gone out of the room for a second. And I
                    came back in and it was all dark and I was trying to see the feet as I walked
                    back to my place.</p>
                <p>All the sudden I saw this pair of incredibly hairy legs that were about this long
                    that had little socks on, little baby socks with little tiny tennis shoes. And I
                    thought, “My God! How could a baby have legs like that?” And I looked and it was
                    a chimp. It was the chimp and the chimp was asleep in his lap with his little
                    legs sticking out. But he had little rompers on and these little shoes with the
                    white socks. And there he was.</p>
                <p>And he was there for about four more months because finally he got so wrapped up
                    in the chimp that the Peace Corps gave him the option of either leaving the
                    chimp or leaving the post, and he chose to leave the post with the chimp. So
                    that was interesting. But there were so many things like that in Gabon that I
                    could tell you fifty stories about life there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was very funny. Nancy, I'd like to close on the
                        question that you brought up regarding your children on the world view one
                        gets from having the experience in the Foreign Service. How about your
                        perspective this time. How the Foreign Service has changed your view or
                        shaped your views over the years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well, I think for me... You know, it seems to me that young people
                    nowadays are much more grounded in their views and their beliefs than I was when
                    I came into the Foreign Service. I think that I was, for some reason, sort of
                    like a sponge. I didn't have particularly strong views one way or the other when
                    I entered the Foreign Service with my husband. I think I probably just lived as
                    a free spirit without really paying too much attention one way or another to
                    develop any strong views about things. Other than politics. I always had strong
                    views about politics.</p>
                <p>But what I have to say is that I think my view of life has really been colored by
                    what I've seen around the world. And the way I view life now, I think, is
                    basically a result of having experienced a lot of different ways of living. I
                    really believe that there are a lot of different lives you can lead. And a lot
                    of different ways you can think and believe. And I think they're all right. I
                    think it's just different people expressing their experience of life in
                    different ways. So I have to say since I've experienced so many different kinds
                    of life, I think that my view is that you really have to just try to experience
                    life as best you can and basically respect everyone else's opportunity to do
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I was just thinking in terms of sort of your basic philosophy of life. I think
                    that I really do view life as a series of experiences. Just recently I was
                    reading a book by Nietzsche and I found in there a quote that seemed to me to be
                    appropriate for my life in the Foreign Service because I think it really does
                    say a lot about how you learn from your experiences and how you really kind of
                    establish your set of beliefs according to what you experience. At least I have.
                    And Nietzsche said, “Read only your own life and from this understand the
                    hieroglyphics of universal life.” And I think that that's really what I have
                    found for me living all these different lives has done. It's given me a code, I
                    would say, by which to judge all of my experiences of life and put things in
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like creating a framework for you to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, in which I can operate. A framework of beliefs, of acceptance of
                    people, of possibilities for change. All of those things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how do your families feel about all this? Your being
                        in the Foreign Service. Do they see you differently? Does that change your
                        relationship? What kind of ideas do they have about the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I think they think it's really great. In fact I think for the most part,
                    most of them wish they'd been able to do it. I think they view it as just such
                    an incredible opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you mentioned that your father was a businessman
                        and did not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, exactly. Even he came around a little bit before he died. He died
                    about ten years ago, and I think even he was beginning to see that maybe this
                    lifestyle wasn't all bad. That maybe there were some things about it that were
                    really kind of nice. Because he loved to travel and I think he really, for the
                    first time, thought that it offers a lot of really wonderful things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you never felt that they were looking at you a little
                        bit differently or have any problem relating to them your experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, I've never had any problem relating to them. Not at all. I guess the
                    one thing that always surprises me, and everybody experiences this so my
                    experience is not unique, is that it is pretty difficult to go into too much
                    depth in talking about where you've been because, if people haven't been there,
                    it's hard for them to maintain interest for very long in hearing your life
                    experiences while you've been away.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like showing your picture book to other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, right. So after about fifteen minutes, there's always the, “When I
                    was there,” or switching to another topic. I think that is hard for people.
                    Although I've been amazed that in particular in my husband's family... My
                    mother's always been very interested in travel, but my husband's family has not
                    traveled much. But we can sit with his parents for hours and tell them about our
                    experiences and they want to hear about all of them. I think for them it's
                    really been wonderful having somebody in the Foreign Service in the family.
                    They're very proud of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finally, when they come to visit, and I assume that some
                        of your friends and family have visited you overseas, what kind of comments
                        do they make about that? Is it like, “Oh this is what the Foreign Service is
                        about!”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: No, they never talk about the Foreign Service. Again, you see, I think
                    even that... It's not really in the context of the Foreign Service, it's in the
                    context of traveling around the world. They don't really think about it in terms
                    of the Foreign Service. Even to this day they don't think about it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they don't see your husband as representing the U.S.
                        and doing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: They see that. Yes, they see that and they know he's a government
                    employee. But they don't ever, I don't think, think about the Foreign Service as
                    a separate entity, or the culture of the Foreign Service. None of that is of any
                    interest to them whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they have no illusion, as some people have, that the
                        Foreign Service is all glamour and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I don't think so. No, in fact, I think that their initial reaction was
                    the opposite. That it's going to be a real inconvenience for you all. You'll
                    have to move around all the time and have to do all this. So I don't think that.
                    I don't think they've ever had an idea that it was particularly glamorous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Glamorous? I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What adjective would you use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: I would talk more, maybe, in terms of rewarding. Really an interesting
                    life, illuminating, focusing, enlightening even. And certainly I've always
                    always felt a great deal of appreciation for the opportunity. But glamorous, I
                    don't think so. That hasn't been my experience. No, but I know many people do.
                    Many, many people think that it is. I think it's a lot of hard work. It's
                    tremendously hard work. I think that's the reason that even some of the
                    glamorous events are glamorous because you have to work so hard. It's true.
                    Whenever you go to an event, you're always there, it seems to me, doing
                    something to help make that event a success. So I've never felt that it's really
                    different from work, although it's very enjoyable work, but it's hard work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the fact that you're still here!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, I'm still here!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your husband is still working. He's now at the Senate

                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Yes, he's working for Senator Rockefeller.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>FORBORD: Well I can't think of anything Monique. I'm sure that we could probably
                    go on for hours talking about all of this, but I think probably I've given you
                    enough to think about and listen to. (laughter)</p>
