                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 10th of February, 2003. This is an interview
                        with William Green Miller, and this is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Do you go by Bill or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me when and where you were born and
                        something about your family background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I was born in New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: 1931, August 15th, and I was brought up in New York. I'm a native New
                    Yorker. I went to public schools until the 7th grade when I went to Trinity
                    School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to take you back a bit. First, about your father,
                        could you tell me about his background and sort of the Miller family on his
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. He was a commercial artist. His family came from St. Petersburg
                    around 1890 and they settled in New York. His father's work was as a contractor,
                    renovation of apartments, things of that sort, although his background was as a
                    soldier, as far as I understand the family history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he get any higher education?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MILLER: My grandfather? No. My father, didn't get any higher education beyond
                    high school, because he was born deaf, and went to primary and secondary schools
                    in New York for the deaf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: My father. My mother, who was also deaf, was born in New York. She was of
                    Irish ancestry. Her father was a Protestant from Dublin, and her mother was a
                    Catholic from Dublin. Her mother was disowned for marrying a Protestant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, this is an era oI mean, this is very
                        important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Still is. She grew up in New York. They met in the circles of deaf people
                    in their schools, and married in 1930 and I was born in 1931.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father, you say he was an illustrator, do you recall
                        any of the sort of things he was doing as an illustrator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the company he worked for, which I remember, did various things,
                    maps, advertising, lay-outs, that sort of thing, and he worked on things that go
                    into lithographs particularly. He was very good at drawings that would transfer
                    to the lithographic technique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it growing up with your parents both being deaf? I
                        always think of the Lon Chaney experience, where both his parents were deaf,
                        and the concern with whether the son would be deaf. How does this work out
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It wasn't a problem at all because New York is so compressed that the
                    isolation of the silent world really doesn't apply. It was just another language
                    to me, realltwo languages actually, that is, sign and being able to read lips
                    and to intuit, I suppose, might also be part of that. I was learning English, of
                    course, and the varieties of American English because New York is such a melting
                    poIrish, Italian, German. Those were the major groups I remember, as well as
                    Native New Yorkermeaning those who had been in New York for at least a
                    generation. But the church was very important for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which church was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: St. Mark's Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Catholic Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, St. Marks was an Episcopal church. I had a good voice as a child. I
                    sang in the choir. The church was the center of many of my activities and I was
                    given a scholarship to Trinity School in New York. I was a good athlete, as well
                    as the first in my class all the way through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of athletics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I played everything. I was a five letterman in a small school, Trinity,
                    in a different era of physical demands. So I played football, I ran winter track
                    and spring track, I played baseball and basketball. We were very well coached.
                    All our teams did very well. Our basketball team was undefeated in 1948 in a
                    very tough league. I was awarded the Holden Cup given to the best athlete in the
                    school in my senior year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at home? This is the eras a small lad you were
                        there to catch or at least be aware of the Great Depression toward the end.
                        Did this affect your family very much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I don't think so becausno, we were never in poverty. We were poor,
                    but never in poverty. My father was always working so there was never that
                    problem that so many had in the thirties and since everyone else I knew was in
                    the same condition it was not seen by me as exceptional. My childhood life
                    growing up was within a city and a community and a world where everyone shared
                    this experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about New York being such a cosmopolitan placdid the
                        outside world intrude as far as national politics and international events
                        and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, very definitely, from the beginning. Not only because of the
                    ethnic make up of the city which was heightened, I'd say, by that time, because
                    of tragic events in Europe and the explosion of New York as a city in every way.
                    There were an abundance of newspapers which I saw and read many at the time. I
                    had a radio from my earliest memory so I heard news and music as well. I grew up
                    with WQXR, that music and news station of the New York Times. The schools were
                    very vibrant. The schools I went to had excellent teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your family fall in the political spectrum? Was
                        this something which you were aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, very much. Since it was in New York City, politics it the time of
                    was LaGuardia, while in national politics it was Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the liberal Republican and the liberal Democrat.
                        This is very much ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: This was, and I like to think is the mainstream majority of United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall Mayor LaGuardia reading the comics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I heard him do this on the radio a number of times. I recall even seeing
                    LaGuardia chasing fire engines, things like that. I was at the opening of
                    LaGuardia airporI went to that occasion when LaGuardia cut the ribbon opening
                    the airport. I remember the first DC-3's land in great majesty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well, you were also there for the World's Fair in
                        1939. Trylon and Perisphere or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Perisphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perisphere. Did you get out and around New York a lot, I
                        mean the city?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I went, as many of my contemporaries did, and explored the city in
                    every way. Buses, subways, bicycle and on fooI went to every subway stop,
                    explored every neighborhood. Travel throughout the city was encouraged in the
                    schools. The race issue of black versus white was not a problem, even in
                    Harlem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really was quite a safe city.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It waat least I thought so. I became very conversant with every part of
                    the city, every museum, every church, every monument; we even went to polo games
                    on Governor's Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about Trinity School. In the first place, what
                        grades were there, and what years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MILLER: Trinity School is the oldest school in the United States in continuous
                    existence, a private school founded in 1709 for the education of the boys in the
                    church choir on the site of the present Trinity Church. It then moved to where
                    Rockefeller Center is now. At that time, it was a part of King's College; it was
                    a preparatory school for King's College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was later Columbia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, later Columbia, and then when Columbia moved up town, Trinity moved
                    uptown as well to 91st St, West 91st Sthat was at the end of the 19th Centurnext
                    to St. Agnes Church. It's been there since.</p>
                <p>It was a very rigorous boys' church school from first grade through high school
                    with small classes. My class had a graduating class of 100. They had a work
                    program, everyone had to work, washing dishes, cleaning toilets, working on the
                    athletic fields, although most of the students were from very wealthy
                    families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to a prep school called Kent, which had very much
                        that system. I was pretty good at cleaning the latrines by the time I got
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There's no harm in that. The teachers were superb. We learned a lot,
                    including Latin and a little Greek, even the beginnings of the new physics. In
                    those days they still had a required course on the history of New York, which
                    was my introduction to Washington Irving, among other things. It was an
                    excellent school, and the education I was given led to Williams College.
                    Trinity's headmaster, Matthew Dann, said, “You should go to college,” and I
                    said, “I would like to go to college.” He said, “You'll have to find a
                    scholarship,” and I said, “I understand that.” He said, “Well then, you'll go to
                    Williams.” Although I had applied to Harvard and Yale, and was accepted to all
                    three, I went to Williams on full scholarshia really remarkable scholarship
                    called the Tyng Scholarship which gave me full board and tuition at Williams and
                    for three years of graduate study at any place of my choosing, which for me was
                    at Magdalen College, Oxford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to Williams, at Trinityou mentioned that the
                        school encouraged you to get around. Was there a sort of an active a program
                        in raising the young lads to understand the world about them and get them
                        out and around or was this just ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it was a conscious notion that you had to know your community in
                    order to be a leader in it. They believed their mission was to train leaders of
                    the community and the country, and you had to know about it. The teachers
                    werthey were great and worked very hard with us to encourage us to work as
                    diligently as possible, and to try and excel. There were several of them that I
                    remember well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any teachers that particularly were
                        influential to you?</hi>

                <p>MILLER: Oh, there were many, but the one who was there for a very long time, a
                    Mr. Chips kind of personality, Clarence Bruner-Smithe just died two years ago at
                    the age of 98. He was my English teacher junior and senior year. He encouraged
                    all of us to write as much as possible. We had to write a piece every day, an
                    essay every day. We had to explicate every day and we had to cover great swaths
                    of reading. Over the four years of high school, of upper school, all of the
                    great classics were read, plus we were required to read the New York Times
                    everyday and make reports on current events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Williams. You were in what class? '53? I
                        was class of '50.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: At Williams?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so we overlapped a little.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I remember many from your class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our biggest member was Steve Sondheim, who gained a
                        certain reputation thereafter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I guess he learned a lot from Professor Irving Shainman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Williams strike you at the time? What sort of
                        school was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was very mixed, I thought. There were people from World War II, the
                    last of those, and certainly the junior faculty were those who had war
                    experience. Williams was in something of a turmoil. It was the end of the
                    Phinney Baxter era, and the end of a gentlemen's college. In a very interesting
                    way, I think the war had a lot to do with the changes. I think the Harvard Red
                    Book, the core curriculum, had a lot to do with it, the curriculum which
                    Williams adopted, a definition of liberal education and the confident commitment
                    to that, and a very serious academic effort to fulfill the goals of a liberal
                    education.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>It was the beginning of the end of the fraternities. I was appalled in many ways
                    by the idea of fraternities, even though I loved the life that I liveI was in
                    the Kappa Alpha (KA) House, which was a terrific place to live, and I had
                    wonderful classmates and the house was a good one. I think most of my classmates
                    believed in “universal rushing,” but fraternities were clearly an anachronism.
                    They no longer quite fit. There were many questions being raised by all of
                    us.</p>
                <p>The Korean War I can remember as a freshman. I was drafted. I received a notice
                    to report to North Adams for a physical along with some of my classmates and my
                    fellow Americans from North Adams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was a mill town, General Electric.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. So we were all there, the potential draftees, at the North Adams
                    Draft Office standing in our underwear getting a physical examination. We were
                    all exempted because we were students. We didn't have to go to combat. Almost no
                    one in my class went in the draft. Students in good schools were all exempted.
                    The Korean War draft policy created this kind of disparity, some parts of our
                    society were drafted, other parts were not. It was far from equitable. But the
                    influence of the Korean War was there, at Williams. The experience of the past
                    world war was deeply felt as well. There were teachers who taught brilliantly
                    about the Nazis. Professor Robert Waite, as you may recalI don't know if you
                    remember him. In the English department for example, there were many brilliant
                    people, many of whom experienced the war, but most of the younger faculty didn't
                    have experience in the Second World War. I think that mix of experiences, both
                    tragic and innocent was a key thing that shaped what I understood to be the
                    meaning of it alwhat might be called my world view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember Fredrick Rudolph was, had been an historian in
                        the army in the Pacific.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was real historian of great depth and quality in my opinion. He
                    conveyed the sense of what historians need to dwhat constituted real research.
                    Almost all of the faculty insisted on their students being able to write, and to
                    read, and understand; the faculty of every discipline worked that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I am quite convinced that one of the reasons I received the scholarship that I
                    did, which was the Tyng, was because I was such a good athlete even though I was
                    at the top of my class as a scholar, I played in freshman year, all the sports
                    as I had in school, and was a starter, but I didn't feel the same joy of sports.
                    I could see the division between almost professional and amateur, even at
                    Williams. Not only the “ringers” - as they were called as a group, of which I
                    suppose I was one by definition, were at odds with those who took sports as a
                    pastime and not a way of lifnot as an all-consuming profession. I came to the
                    view that sports that took all or most of your time and effort detracted from
                    the whole point of going to a college of excellence. So that thought was
                    troubling for me all the way through Williams, because I was split about
                    devoting so much time to sports. There were plenty of other diversions, of
                    course, - girls for one. My favorite teachers there were in the English
                    department primarily, and they encouraged me to keep going as hard as I could in
                    my studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning that things were changing. You were
                        there during the McCarthy period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I saw McCarthy and heard him speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I left in '50. Fred Schumann was one of the first people
                        picked on by McCarthy, and I remember him making a rebuttal to McCarthy, but
                        then I left in '50 and was in the military for four years. I got caught in
                        the Korean War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: This was Don Gregg's class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and I think maybe he was class head. How did
                        McCarthyiswhat was the attitude that you were getting there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was a monster. He was seen as a threat to intellectual freedom and
                    rational discourse that was the way he was perceived. I saw him in action. I
                    went to hear him speak at Smith. My wife to be Suzanne, who was a student at
                    Smith, and I were in the audience when he spoke. He spoke as a personification
                    of the fear of communism. He spoke as if from authority on high. “I have a
                    paper...” and was a visible confirmation of his qualities, he was a
                    personification of the “threat” the whole idea of the Communist threat. His dark
                    personality shaped our world view. On the other hand, at the opposite end of the
                    spectrum, we read and were influenced by the Mr. “X” paper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was George Kennan's.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MILLER: That when I first had the thought that I'd like to go into the diplomatic
                    life, into the Foreign Service. I read that essay and I said, “I want to be like
                    George Kennan.” As it turned out, he weaved in and out of my life as a model and
                    as a friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interestinand correct me, because I wasn't there, but
                        I had the feeling that Williams, unlike some of the other schools, came out
                        fairly well out of the McCarthy attacks, and even later on the Vietnam War.
                        It didn't roll over to the right or the left. How do you feel about saying
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Williams protected their faculty. Professor Fred Schumann, for example,
                    was a target of investigation, and the Williams administration and Board
                    protected him. People who detested his views on the Soviet Union still went to
                    his classes, enjoyed them and were able to have a different viea different
                    dimension. There was very little acceptance of the validity and ideology
                    contained in McCarthy red-baiting. This was so, partially because of the
                    faculty, but I think it was largely because of the student body. We came from
                    sophisticated enough backgrounds to not fall prey to McCarthyism. The curriculum
                    faculty, and the people who came to Williams to speak on these issues, and the
                    opening of mass international reporting and communications still primarily
                    radio, not yet television, was extensive, objective and deep enough to make a
                    difference in our understanding of the realities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the fraternity system, which we both
                        belonged to, but I was kind of uncomfortable particularland I hadn't taken
                        any real stand at that time, but there were sort of mainline fraternities
                        that would not accept Jews. It was breaking down, but this is very troubling
                        and all and I think to the veterans' generation this just didn't play
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's right. By the time I was there the kind of discrimination, you
                    mentioned, particularly anti-Semitism, although it was latent, had disappeared
                    as a legal matter. The main issue during my Williams years was exemplified by
                    the Garfield Club catch all for non-fraternity individuals. Some who were not
                    taken into fraternities and were therefore Garfield Club members suffered the
                    psychological harm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the Garfield Club was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MILLER: The Garfield Club was intended for those who were not taken into
                    fraternities. Some few went to the Garfield Club because they were opposed to
                    fraternities on principle. It was a social center that had some of the amenities
                    of the fraternity houses for those that weren't in fraternities. There were a
                    few who, on principle, didn't want to belong to them, but not many. In the 50's,
                    most Garfield Club members were either Jews or outsiders or misfits in the terms
                    of Williams society. Nonetheless, the fraternity system as it existed then was
                    seen by most Williams men as an injustice, unnecessary. Then a significant
                    social change took place when I was at Williamcomplete rushing.</p>
                <p>Actually, I was one of the leaders of the group appointed by the student council
                    to consider doing away with fraternities. I was an author of the report
                    summarizing a study that had surveyed other colleges and universities on this
                    question of the place of fraternities in a modern liberal arts college,
                    particularly in eastern colleges and universities. As it happened I later
                    marriethis is getting ahead of the gama niece of President Jack Sawyer who
                    carried out the abolition of all fraternities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, he was president of Williams. I am thinking of
                        what I heard, today Williams is considered one of two or the top three elite
                        liberal arts schools. Something like 75% graduate with honors. The
                        Gentleman's C has long has left, but in your time how did you find the
                        attitude towards people who were coming in? Were they exceptionally bright
                        or was it a good mix, or how did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think my classmates were exceptional, and very bright. The Gentleman's
                    C, however, was the norm. Many could have done much much better but it was an
                    acceptable norm mostly for those on the way to Wall Street as a broker or a
                    banker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or advertising, in my time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, advertising, the next largest group in my class were lawyers.
                    Government service or teaching were the professions of only 5% of my class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Way down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: 5%, so I was in that small group. I would say my classmates were as good
                    as the students are now. There were a number of legacies, so-called, but there
                    still are, and the legacies on the whole were as good as anybody else.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MILLER: And the relations of graduates and many of whom were donors loyal to the
                    college because of what it gave them, their experience of learning at one of the
                    best provincial New England colleges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated in '53. How did you feel about what
                        you'd gotten out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I valued Williams very much. First, I was grateful because Williams and
                    the Tyng fellowship enabled me to have a superb university education without any
                    financial difficulty. Teaching was superb and the teachers encouraged me to go
                    on and gave valuable guidance and mentoring. I had mixed feelings about the
                    sense of purpose of some of my own contemporaries, because it was very evident
                    to me, and certainly to the thoughtful faculty, that as a nation and as a
                    society, we all were in for a long stretch of difficult times, both and as a
                    nation and as a world. The seriousness of the problems that were ahead didn't
                    seem to be in the minds of many of my contemporaries.</p>
                <p>What I was going to do with all of this knowledge and foreboding I wasn't quite
                    sure. The possibility that I would be drafted was always there as a possible
                    future. I was ready to go at any point, but due to the peculiarities and the
                    inequities of the whole draft system I never had to, although I was always on
                    the edge of being taken. In fact I tried to enlist in the navy, and the navy
                    recruiters wouldn't let me, because I was in the possible draft category. It was
                    one of those bizarre circumstances.</p>
                <p>The graduation speaker was Governor Christian Herter. He spoke about the
                    challenge of the Cold War and the role of leadership for educated men and
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Governor at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was before he was Secretary of State. That whole sense of
                    difficulty before us during the depth of the Cold War was intensified because of
                    the McCarthy paranoia and many of the horrible things that were going on in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>So I was encouraged to go to Oxford and the Tyng ?</p>

                </p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes. The Tyng Fellowship provided for three years funding for almost
                    anything I might want to do. If you wanted to start a business you could do
                    that, or if you wanted to go to Antarctica you could have done that, and so on.
                    Anyway, I choose to go to Oxford, and applied to Magdalen College on the
                    suggestion of several of my teachers: Don Gifford, Jack Ludwig, Clay Hunt, Jack
                    O'Neill among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd better spell Magdalen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: M-A-G-D-A-L-E-N, I applied to Magdalen, because C. S. Lewis was there and
                    he would be the tutor. I was accepted, and went, arriving in the fall of
                    1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, I was wondering you were there in
                        '52. How did the election of '52, which was Eisenhower vs. Adlai Stevenson,
                        how would you say at college it affected both you and your fellow
                        students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I would say opinion was pretty even, I would say the split was 50/50 on
                    Stevenson-Eisenhower. You remember the Whitaker Chambers - Alger Hiss
                    controversy. Liberal values were questioned in this time of international
                    uncertainty brought about by the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had been at Williams for a short time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: So that was a dividing line. Did you believe Whitaker Chambers' testimony
                    or not? Was it Hiss or Chambers? Who told the truth? Or was it somewhere in
                    between. This was also the time of the Oppenheimer-Strauss loyalty case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alger Hiss.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Of course it was also Acheson versus Nixon. All of those were very
                    interesting personalities, so there was a lot of debate about basic ideology.
                    People tended to go down in two categories according to their family
                    backgrounds. It was a very close call because, of course, Eisenhower could have
                    easily been a Democrat and he was a very popular wartime leader, and a decent,
                    moderate man in most respects. Certainly the eastern Republicans who supported
                    that war were at least as liberal as the Democrats.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A different era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, well, they're gone, for the most part.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Oxford from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Fifty-three to '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oxford versus Williams. Could you compare and
                        contrast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, yes, I can compare and contrast. I went to Oxford as an
                    undergraduate, again, which was the custom, but it was an entirely different
                    system. I would say that, at least for me, Williams, in many respects, was a
                    preparation for Oxford, as far as intensive study goes. Williams gave a
                    wonderful broad survey of Western learning as we understood it in the '50s, but
                    with very few exceptions, no depth in any particular subject. I had deeply
                    studied some authors, but otherwise I surveyed all of English literature,
                    American, European and world history, philosophy, science. It was the Red Book,
                    core curriculum survey of knowledge. At Oxford you studied, very narrowly, one
                    subject to the point approaching complete learning. That's the approach. It's
                    assumed that when you come to Oxford that you already have the background for
                    everything else. You are coming to Oxford to use scholarship in its received
                    form assembled over the centuries of learning, building your own study with that
                    base of received knowledge. The teaching of the Dons, their behavior, student
                    expectations and behavior, even the examination system, is part of the way of
                    life predicated on an entirely different history, social life, and structure.
                    Oxford and Cambridge was a very different kind of university in a very different
                    society and natioeven if the differences were often subtle.</p>
                <p>As an American, I was a rarity, relatively speaking. It was a definitely and
                    proudly British university. Even with the presence of Rhodes scholars, Americans
                    were relatively few in number, there were only or two Americans in each college.
                    “Ex-colonials,” was the perception that most of my British college mates who
                    came to Oxford had of Americans..</p>
                <p>Oxford had war veterans, who had been in the same wars, including Korea. Many of
                    my best friends, English friends, were veterans of Korea. They were about the
                    same age as I was. The life in Magdalen was wonderful. It was a very beautiful
                    college setting. Magdalen, being first established in the 14th century, had a
                    core medieval complex of buildings. My rooms were in a building called New
                    Buildings which was called “new” because it was built in the 17th and 18
                    centuries. New Buildings flanked the deer park. My rooms were on the ground
                    floor. My very first morning, upon waking up, began with the pleasure of seeing
                    the deer bouncing by the window and a scout coming in with a cup of tea to wake
                    me up. That was the first day of a different civilization, you might say,
                    although the new civilization used words from my own language. The tutorial
                    system at Oxford was one of the most perfect ways of teaching and learning, it
                    seemed to me. I took to it with the greatest delight.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I had a wonderful tutor of Old English named Jack Bennett who was a New
                    Zealander. We read Beowulf with him and all of the difficult old English and
                    Middle English texts some of which are wonderful, but many unfortunately, that
                    are not so wonderful. Word for word, we read and tried to commit them all to
                    memory. Jack Bennett was a great human being and a wonderful scholar of many
                    things. Henry James for example, but he knew all the American authors. C. S.
                    Lewis for me was a great feast of intellect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because C. S. Lewis is so well known, he never waI don't
                        know what you call it had tenure at that university.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did? I thought that there was something ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, no, he was never given the full honors by the University of Oxford of
                    the number one literary professor although he deserved those honors. He was a
                    Don, a senior Don at Magdalen, a professor in the Oxford English faculty, but it
                    was his Christianity, his Christian writings, that got in the way of his natural
                    scholarship reward, I'd say. There was never any discussion of religious matters
                    except in terms of literary texts that were religious in subject matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of courses did you have with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was my tutor for everything from Chaucer on, till the present. So we
                    read with C. S. Lewis Chaucer, Spencer, Shakespeare, and Miltoeverything up to
                    the 19th century. When you hit the 19th century that was for Oxford modern
                    English. The twentieth century was modern writing. You did that on your own. The
                    formal study of literature stopped at the Victorians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was this preparing you for, did you see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The intent of the Oxford Schools, as they were called, was to lay out the
                    full extent of knowledge on particular subjects. Mastery of the subject would
                    prepare you for teaching. You sit at the foot of the master, learning what he
                    knows, and you transmit what he knows through you to others, adding to the total
                    knowledge to some degree. At that point, I was very convinced that after Oxford
                    and Harvard, I would teach English literature. I was very interested in
                    Renaissance literature so I spent a lot of time reading the great works in
                    Italian, and of course English, and French, to some extent. I thought that I
                    would go on and teach at an American university as a life's work.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>So that's what I was driving towards, a life of university teaching, but during
                    that time, the Hungarian uprising took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: And during that time George F. Kennan was there in London giving the
                    Reith lectures. I had the opportunity to meet with him. This is how it happened.
                    I still had the “fire engine, I'd become a fireman” idea. I wanted to be like
                    hilike Mr. “X”. I wrote a letter to George Kennan, having been given his address
                    in London, and said I'd like to talk to him about going into the Foreign
                    Service. He agreed to do so. When we met, I asked him what his advice would be.
                    He said, “No don't go into the Foreign Service. It's not what it used to be.
                    It's no longer relevant to Foreign Policy. It's something else.” He was very
                    clear about the diminished state of the Foreign Service. I was not convinced
                    that the Foreign Service was not a key element in our foreign policy. So I took
                    the exam anyway. I took the exams in Frankfurt and I passed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year did you take them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Fifty-six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took mine in Frankfurt in '53, when I was still in the
                        Air Force.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There were three examinerI remember Ambassador Butterworth was one. There
                    were three officers: one was consular and the third was in public affairs. I
                    enjoyed the interview very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which one of the questions were asked? This is for the
                        oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was the oral exam. The questions were all on the contemporary
                    situation, particularly, attitudes towards Central Europe. There were questions
                    about McCarthy, and some of them werthe initial sewere obviously intended to
                    prove how much I knew about the world in general. That part went quickly, and
                    then they went into really deep questions about the sense of purpose and the
                    breadth of our foreign policy. I found the exam a wonderful experience. The
                    examiners, I thought, were very civilized serious people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might just point out, when I started this oral history
                        program back in '85, I wrote to George Kennan saying, “I was trying to start
                        up an oral history program, what do you think of it?” And his advice was
                        kind of parallel to yours. “Well probably not a good idea, but if you do,
                        only interview the right people.”</hi>

                <p>MILLER: I think the sense of common purpose, I found in England was powerful.
                    There was also great fatigue from the destruction of the previous war as well as
                    the uplifting united effort of rebuilding. When I was at Oxford, food was still
                    being rationed, as you may recall. Butter, for example, even the dons had a
                    little plastic container with their own butter served along with the gleaming
                    silver of high table. There would be several dinners a week with whale meat as
                    the main course. Many of the dishes were, because of the shortage of normal
                    supplies of beef and pork, were of rabbit and game, but not much of it. There
                    was a shortage of coal, so it was very cold. We wore overcoats to dinner all the
                    time in winter. Gasoline was still short, and the evidence of the war was still
                    therrubble, in the street, damaged buildings. Certainly in travels on the
                    continent we saw the effect of bomb damage everywhere.</p>

                <p>MILLER: I knew them all through C. S. Lewis. Tolkien, I knew, because I took his

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MILLER: Tolkien taught Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and other works of Middle
                    English. I went for three years to his lectures and he never finished because he
                    was always discovering new things, and thinking them through and literally
                    acting them out in the course of a lecture, so it was ongoing experiment. Pearl
                    and Patience and other Middle English workhe taught me Middle-English, and he
                    was superb teacher, a great character. So through C. S. Lewis, I was invited to
                    meet him at a pub across the High Street from Magdalen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he go into the pub, or whatever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, well there were a number of us, at the Westgate pub, right across
                    the street from Magdalen. Tolkien was a don at Merton, which is right next door
                    to Magdalen. I saw him often as a human being. There was another member of the
                    group named Hugo Dyson, who was a Shakespearean, a little tiny man that looked
                    like Santa Claus or Tom Bombadil. So they were there all together, including
                    Dorothy Sayemost of the main ones. They were also very close to some of the
                    Catholics at Cowley Fathers, which was where the Catholic intellectuals were. It
                    was a natural community because it was a center of the study of Renaissance, and
                    medieval history, philosophy, and religious questions. They were wonderful
                    people, totally devoted to their subjects, and a great inspiration. Tolkien's
                    Hobbit books were coming out at that time, that is, the Fellowship of the Ring,
                    while I was there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the three volumes are worth $28,000, his first editions. They are
                    published in every language and the copies in English number in the millions
                    now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure I got the first but I got something that
                        everyone had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they were published over four or five years. So they were coming
                    out when I was there. It was a marvelous experience to know the author as a
                    teacher, and of course the books are very powerful. My wife and I, we were just
                    married. We lived in a small Oxford flat and would read them together. They were
                    often terrifying. So I knew the Inklings as a student, and I valued them and
                    their teaching and writing enormously.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Oxford and all, were you conflicted as far as whither
                        goest Bill Millebecause things were happening in Europe? I mean the Cold War
                        was really at its height and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes very much so. I recall one trip. As you know, at Oxford they had long
                    vacations in between semesters, eight weeks made a semester, then there was six
                    weeks of vacation. So during the six weeks we'd go to different places. On one
                    of these six week vacations, I went with Suzanne to the continent. It was my
                    first time in Vienna. It was New Year's, right at New Year's. We had gone skiing
                    in the middle of Austria, to a very remote place that we could afford, as
                    students, Schladming. Although it was quite remote and hard to get to, it was
                    pretty good skiing, actually. Then we went to Vienna on New Year's Day. It was
                    bitterly cold. The one star, or perhaps minus one star, hotel we could afford
                    had no heat, just many quilts. On the bitterly cold day we saw the changing of
                    the Four Power Occupation Guard in the center of Vienna. I saw the command
                    change from the American to the Soviets. The American honor marching guard had
                    chromium helmets, chromium-plated helmets, and chromium-plated bolts on their,
                    highly polished, Springfield rifles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably because those were better drill things than
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Better rifles, anyway, as far as their accuracy. The Americans wore
                    spats, white spats over their polished black bootand the Drill Team was very
                    swingy, there were a lot of blacks, and the music was loose, loose-jointed. The
                    Soviet guard had a lot of Asians in it. They were terrifying. They all seemed to
                    be giants, chosen probably for their size and fearsome appearance or so it
                    seemed to me. They had among their band instruments, a set of loud timbrels. The
                    clash of our cultures and the differences between us seemed evident in the
                    changing of the guards. It was also evident in the division of the city, and the
                    politics of the citthis era of the Vienna pictured in The Third Man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in '55 when the peace treaty signed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No. It was a year before that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The last changing of the guard, yes. It was wonderful. I had a friend at
                    Oxford who was at Magdalen with me, Peter Szabo, who was an Austro-Hungarian. He
                    lived in Vienna, right across from the opera in the Opera square. We went to
                    dinner at his house, which was in a state of elegant disrepair, but clearly
                    slowly coming back into something viable. There was the whole sense of the new
                    era coming together after a horrible, horrible experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So traveling through Europe as a student gave me some sense to the reality of
                    what we were dealing with, but I loved being there and being a part of it. We
                    were, of course, welcomed to be a part of it as students, and particularly with
                    friends from those different worlds. I was drawn into that world because of that
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are really two different worlds. I mean, the very
                        narrow, scholastic, but highly intellectuaand then looking at Europe, in
                        those days ruins were everywhere and the Soviet threat was a very real
                        one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but the inward looking monastic life of Oxford had been broken by
                    new forms of communications, mass media, the radio, certainly by the experience
                    of the war, the immediate recent experience of the war, and the recovery still
                    underway, and students from the countries of the former colonies and elsewhere.
                    They were very cosmopolitan. It was the number one university in the world at
                    that time. Yet there was also the sense that it was declining. That whole sense
                    of an end to an era was very deep in the European mentality at the time.
                    Americans were looked on as the successors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Oxford did you have to make adjustments
                        or to show that you as an American weren't a barbarian? I mean, as part of
                        this Oxford world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there was always the whole sense that the English were testing
                    yoasking who are you and what do you know, can we ever be friends, and so on.
                    The ultimate test was whether you were ever welcomed into their homes, which of
                    course did take place, but the ties really were what we shared as cultures, I
                    would say, and what we knew we were going to share was a prescient sensitivity.
                    Many of people who were at Oxford at the same time are very important to me now,
                    still, even in Iran, for example. My good friend Hossein Mahdavy who is still
                    living in Tehran was at Christ Church when I was at Magdalen. We saw each other
                    often when I later served in Iran between 1959-1964 and we have been close
                    friends and seen each other ever since.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the UK during what became known as the Suez
                        crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was probably the biggest divide between France and
                        Britain and the United States that we've had. How did you feel about

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the Suez Crisis of 1956 is, of course, complicated, because it was
                    the Arab-Israeli issue in its rawest form. We discussed these issues at Oxford
                    in depth. At Oxford I had a friend, an acquaintance, Sara Rothschild, who had
                    one point of view. So there's one side of it. And Ronny Dworkin, who is a legal
                    scholar and professor at Yale, was also a very special friend. It was possible
                    to discuss the Arab-Israeli issue in depth. There were many Arabs, and Turks,
                    Persians, Pakistanis at Oxford, who were raising the same questions that are
                    being raised now. The difficult question of is it possible to obtain a civilized
                    solution, at a university like Oxford, a center of Oriental study, the answer
                    was quite clear, yes it is possible. That remains my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you got married. What was the big event with
                        your wife and how did you meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: She's from Providence. She went to Lincoln School in Providence and then
                    to Emma Willard School. Her family is from Providence, living there from the
                    time of Roger Williams, the very essence of New England. We met at Smith, where
                    she was a student. I was returning from a track meet at Madison Garden in New
                    York where I was running in 440 relays and 50 yard sprints. I was a sprinter.
                    Suzanne was a blind date at Smith College. We were married in Little Compton on
                    August 21, 1954 right after my first year at Oxford. It was her junior year. She
                    spent her junior year in Paris and in Geneva. After a honeymoon in France,
                    Belgium, Holland and Denmark we lived in Oxford, in a house on Squitchy Lane, a
                    lovely little house that belonged to a Burmese don who was at Magdalen and was
                    away on sabbatical. His name was Mynt, Hyam Mynt. It was an idyllic place to
                    begin married life actually.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Fifty-five. I guess it was '55.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes I did have doubts, because I thought very clearly at that time that I
                    wanted to be a professor in English. Further, I did not want to go into the
                    Foreign Service because of the taint of McCarthy. So I decided to go on to
                    Harvard for three years of graduate study. At that time it was an easy
                    decision.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was wonderful. It was Oxford plus, in a way. It was, for me at that
                    time, because Harvard for me was bigger in some sense. For me, it had more
                    dynamism and openness, and it was at that time very experimental. Oxford was set
                    in its wayand had been for centuries, with set pieces, based on the long history
                    of the study of particular subjects. Harvard was also very political, and not
                    only a great mix of people from my own country, a greater mix than I'd seen
                    before, but also of other countries. The English department was brilliant. It
                    had wonderful, wonderful teachers who nurtured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you concentrating on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Renaissance literature. Sir Philip Sidney was the subject of my thesis,
                    which concerns one of the earliest of his works, a novel called The Arcadia,
                    which is something that he wrote in enforced leisure at the age of 30 years old,
                    when he was in exile from the court. I think I was drawn to Sidney not only
                    because he was a great poet and writer, but he was the exemplar of Renaissance
                    literature and action. He was the combination of all the virtues of the time.
                    He, unfortunately, died at an early age in battle in the Lowlands against the
                    Spanish. So my interest in Sidney was kind of a dedication and admiration for
                    the kind of life he led.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: 1580. He was Elizabethan, late Elizabethan. 158he died in 1593.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What battle was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The battle of Zutphen, in the Lowlands against the Spanish. One of those
                    freak accidenta shot, a ball went into his thigh and he got an incurable
                    infection. I was working primarily on Renaissance literature, but I also was
                    reading and studying American literature with Fred Dupee. I don't know if you
                    know that name.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, he was a visiting professor from Columbia. Fred Dupee, became a
                    close friend and was a very important influence. He was a great New York critic.
                    He was one of the key writers on the Partisan Review. He had been, after
                    graduating from Yale, a Communist in the early '30s along with many of the
                    Partisan Review people who later in 1936 turned against the Communists
                    particularly after the purges. After the purges of 1936 they all went the other
                    wastaunch anti-communists. Dupee was a wonderfully sophisticated New York
                    intellectual who was brought up in Joliet, Illinois. Dupee was a great friend of
                    Mary McCarthy's, so through him I met many of the poets and writers that I
                    admired: Robert Lowell, plus Mary McCarthy, and Louise Bogan, Philip Roth, Saul
                    Bellow and Gore Vidal. So the literary life and scholarly life at Harvard was
                    something that was appealing. There were other great scholars like Rosamund
                    Tuve, who was a Spencerian, from Connecticut College, a great scholar. Douglas
                    Bush was my thesis advisor, and Bill Alfred was also a thesis advisor. He was a
                    very good poet as well as one of the best scholars of Irish literature. Harvard
                    was rich in contemporary poetry from Yeats and Eliot to Lowell and David
                    Ferry.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The deeper you get into literature it would seem the

                        on hold for the Foreign Service. Were you being able to sup at any of the
                        international experience at Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, of course, because the deeper you get into a serious literature
                    the more you understand that it's about the key events of the time, and by
                    extension and example, of anytime. Whether it's Homer, or whether its Auden, or
                    Robert Lowelthey are talking about the big eventpolitics, ethics and how life
                    should be led, what kind of government there should be, what's right and what's
                    wrong. Actually it's the deep study of literature that drew me back into public
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go on to get your PhD?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I didn't finish. I finished the oral exams, which I passed, and I was
                    three quarters through the thesis on Sidney's Arcadia which is a big, huge text,
                    and a detailed analysis of the text, of The Arcadia. Then I was about to take an
                    ongoing step, to teach at Columbia while doing course work and working on the
                    Arcadia thesis I'd been teaching at Harvard as a teaching assistant in order to
                    pay for the costs of tuition to be able to support my wife. Suzanne had to work
                    as well, and I had to teach in order for us both to get through. The struggle
                    was a great pleasure and a great privilege. We worked very hard and had a great
                    time together. It was a very good way, I think to begin a marriage.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>So I was going on to Columbia. I had been offered a job at Columbia. They asked
                    me to come as an instructor in Renaissance literature. A career in teaching was
                    laid out, it would seem. Then the Foreign Service called to say, come now or
                    forget it. So the thesis on Sydney's Arcadia was set aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be 1959.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: So I thought about it, and after discussion with friends and so on, I
                    said, “Well, I'll get the Foreign Service out of my system. I probably won't
                    like it, as George Kennan said, but I'll never know and I'll regret not having
                    tested it if I don't do it.” So I decided to enter the Foreign Service in the
                    spring, late spring of '59. My incoming class, my A-100 group was a group of
                    great guys. Who is still around? Allen Holmes, Nick Platt, Brandon Grove, Dick
                    Moose. It was a terrific group. We lived in Alexandria, many of us. We were very
                    close.</p>
                <p>You know very well, you are asked to put down where you want to serve, and I
                    said, “GTI.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Greece, Turkey, and Iran. It was the Greek part that I was interested in
                    from The Arcadia and all that past conditioning. It also reflected a desire to
                    travel in Greece as well. So by luck of the draw I went to Isfahan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your class were there any women, minorities, or
                        anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there were two women. They both went into consular work. There were
                    no minorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was still pretty much the cast of the Foreign Service
                        of the old time, many white males.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and a lot of legacies so to speak, like Allen Holmes and Homer
                    Byington III.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Homer Byington. At one point in my career, I was consul
                        general in Naples, and that was practically his place. That was a province
                        of Homer Byington. I think three generations were born there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's a wonderful history. Yes, Homer was a nice fellow and very
                    able.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a little hard to say, but at that time, how would you
                        describe the attitude of people entering the Foreign Service? Sense of
                        mission, give it a try, a job, a what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Sense of mission, almost without exception. Almost nonI can't think of
                    any, reallat this stage, looking back on it, were there because it was one job
                    among many that were possible. No, they wanted to serve country. It was a sense
                    of duty, for all of us, and there was a great esprit as a consequence. The
                    Foreign Service itself, even the dreariest necessary subjects that were conveyed
                    to us — and all of the hardships were also underlined, for example, that you
                    have to go wherever you are assigned. You won't like many of your assignments.
                    That's part of the discipline. Of course that's not the reality, but that's what
                    everyone was encouraged to believe.</p>
                <p>The mentoring from senior diplomats was very good, maybe it was partially because
                    we had legacies on that group, but we had very solid, real ambassadors as well,
                    who worked with us to show us how the Department worked. Even the A-100 projects
                    were fun. I can recall the policy paper I had to write was on Jomo Kenyatta and
                    the Kikuyu. You had to take an advocate position, and I took the Jomo Kenyatta
                    Kenya rebellion, which was fun to do. I learned a great deal from the Kenya
                    case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the time was pretty controversial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was pretty controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the middle of Aroubu, wasn't it, the freedom
                        movement? It was very brutal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's right. Yes, the killing, the religious-tribal terrorism of the
                    time. Al Qaeda are amateurs in comparison. That was the beginnings of an
                    awareness of the world of violence that has never stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this might be a good place to stop, I think. Cause
                        I'd like to stop with the time. OK, well, we're going to pick this up in
                        1959 when you were off to Isfahan. You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was there from '59 to '62, and then from '62 though the end of '64 in
                    Tehran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a first assignment you really got a dose.</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, it was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Okay, today is the 3rd of March, 2003. Bill, Isfahan. What did you know about
                    Persia or Iran before you went out there?</p>
                <p>MILLER: I knew very little. What I did know came from my friend who I met at
                    Oxford who was a Persian. Hossein Mahdavy is his name. He was at Christ Church,
                    when I was at Magdalen. We became good friends through an Egyptian, Adel
                    Serafim, who was also at Magdalen with me, and was a cousin of his wife-to-be. A
                    complicated marriagChristian and Persian Muslim, but it's something that has
                    lasted. The wife-to-be, Noveen, is a very good friend, a beautiful Copt French
                    woman, and the cousins, the Seraphims were Copts, too. My Magdalen friend is
                    professor at MIT and the other is a very successful financier in Houston now.
                    And with their many other cousinyou can imagine what the network of Middle
                    Eastern connections is. So I knew a little bit about Iran from him, and we had
                    seen and met Iranianthat is Suzanne, my wife and I, had seen young rich Iranians
                    in Geneva where they were called “oil wells” by the Smith girls. Suzanne, my
                    wife, was in her junior year abroad there at the University of Geneva. These
                    were interesting times being in Europe under any circumstances, but as students
                    from the United States it was eye opening to say the least.</p>
                <p>I knew a little bit about Persia from English literaturMilton, the references to
                    Persia in his poetry, a little bit from Greek plays, and Greek history. One
                    could say I knew virtually nothing, except the phenomenon of Mossadeq, as
                    reported to us by the New York Times and Time magazine, and the very fascinating
                    complexity presented by two very different Presidents and administrationthat is
                    Truman who looked on Mossadeq as an interesting fellow, but he didn't see
                    anything wrong with him, certainly not enough to support an overthrow, then
                    Eisenhower seeing Mossadeq as a problem for his great wartime ally, the British.
                    I knew a little bit about that and the oil controversy from the papers and
                    discussions at the time, but nothing at firsthand. So in training and
                    preparation for going to Iran, I asked for Persian language, and they said, “You
                    won't need it.” So I was assigned to German language, which I already knew, for
                    three months, until we went out to Isfahan. We traveled to Iran in the old way,
                    we took a month getting out there, stopping in the major cities of the Middle
                    East on the way. It was a wonderful introduction as a gradual?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This dating again when you went out was '59, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, '59, in the fall of '59. So we stopped, of course, first in London,
                    Paris, Rome, and then Athens, Cairo, Beirut, Istanbul, Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any rumblings when you went to Beirut
                        about our going in there the year before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I had friends who were teaching at AUB like Malcolm Kerr.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American University Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and so we talked about the changes taking place throughout the
                    Middle East, and change was very evidenbut it became increasingly evident that
                    the tensions, in many ways, and the changes taking place in the Middle East,
                    certainly in Cairo, where the military presence of the new regime was evident,
                    (this was the time of Nasser). Although Nasser's Arab nationalism didn't in any
                    way impinge on the romantic character of Cairo and environs. We had a wonderful
                    time staying in ancient Cairo hotels such as the since destroyed Semiramas, with
                    its twenty-five foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows, from which we
                    would watch the kites flying overhead, and to hear the wonderful sounds and
                    smell the exotic smells of Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kites being the birds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, great hawk-like predators, a raptor. Yes, not the other kinds of
                    kites that fly over Tiananmen Square or even Washington.</p>
                <p>Each of these stops was further evidence of change, and of a kind I that I knew I
                    had to understand in some way, and that I didn't understand at that point, the
                    military character of these new regimes, the alienation from the British or
                    French colonial backgrounds of the immediate past. Suzanne and I had a wonderful
                    time on the trip to Iran, it was just the best of Foreign Service notions coming
                    to reality by way of not only traveling, but the freedom to explore and learn
                    and experience. So we arrived in Tehran ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one other thing. In Baghdad, was Qassem in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Qassem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any aftermaths from just a year before
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, only that we found it was the most guarded place we encountered.
                    There were more military in evidence and Baghdad was a less prepossessing city
                    than any of the others. In this atmosphere of military coup and militarI won't
                    say occupatiomilitary governance, it was a less than open atmosphere, although
                    it's a very interesting city, and birthplace of many of the world's great
                    cultures and of course has wonderful museums. At that time of year it is very
                    pleasant.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Tehran late at night, at about midnight or so, and lo and behold no
                    one's there from the Embassy to meet us. We had no real grip of the language, no
                    money, barely knowing the address of the embassy, just orders to report with a
                    note saying, “You'll be met at the airport,” but there was no one there. Our
                    plight was overheard by a British business man, I think an MI5 person, named
                    Michael Collins. He very kindly took us in his car and lent us some money, and
                    we got to the embassy, the embassy apartments, and all was well. So we were
                    there at temporary apartments for a few days and we met the ambassador and the
                    members of the Embassy staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Ambassador Edward Wailes. He was a very nice man. The political counselor
                    was Harry Schwartz.</p>
                <p>We then went down by plane, Iran Air, to Isfahan. This was a one hour flight,
                    over deserts and rugged mountains; a very dramatic flight. The airport at that
                    time was set in between two very high mountain peaks, so it was a dangerous and
                    interesting approach. The skies being clear as they normally are, one could see
                    the beauties of the Zayandeh river valley coming down from the snow covered
                    Zagros mountains, snaking through the piedmont, so to speak, and into the desert
                    plain, and here's this green oasis that extends all the way from the mountains
                    to the great desert, and shiny domes, but not of gold, it's the wonderful green
                    and blue and yellow tiles of Isfahan. The arrival in Isfahan was very different
                    than Tehran. Frank Crawford, who was then consul. We were met by the vice consul
                    who I was replacing, John Exum.</p>
                <p>We went into a temporary apartment in a hotel quite near the consulate which was
                    right at the heart of the old city, of the 16th century city, next to the Bridge
                    of 33 Arches, Si-o-Seh Pol, as it's called. At the entrance to the bridge
                    there's a square that had a statue of the shah. It's called Mojasemeh, which
                    means “Statues Square.” The hotel, conveniently, was called the Isfahan. It was
                    run by an Armenian with a very un-Armenian name, John McDowell, who took very
                    good care of us in those early days. We later found an apartment right on the
                    Mojasemeh Square in a second floor apartment over a bicycle store that was owned
                    by a Bakhtiari Khan, Yahya Khan Bakhtiar, who was one of the Bakhtiari tribal
                    leaders, unfortunately, an opium addict, but a very charming fellow. His
                    apartment was available as he was going off to tribal lands. He very kindly
                    agreed to let us rent the apartment.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>It was most exotic apartment fully furnished in the Persian style, gloriously
                    decorated with Persian artifacts, and in his taste of dark velvets, tribal
                    carpets, and Persian prints. It was a wonderful place to be because all of the
                    noises and sounds, of ordinary life were therthe radios, the shouts of the
                    workers below and all of the traffic going roundabout the square and across the
                    bridge of 33 arches. The consulate was only one building awajust a few yards
                    away.</p>

                <p>MILLER: The building was onlthe consulate was only one block away, and it faced
                    the Mojasemeh, and bordered on the north by a small stream which was dry part of
                    the year, but was part of the irrigation system, they are called mahdis in
                    Isfahan and the mahdis are part of some comic events later. This was a feature
                    of Isfahan, that it had canals, so to speak, for irrigation. From the Zayandeh
                    Rud River, the main stream that comes down from the Zagros Mountains. The word
                    Zayandehrud means “the living river,” which it literally is, it gives life to
                    that whole part of Iran.</p>
                <p>So the consulate was on one side and the bicycle shop was under us and next to us
                    on the other was the home of an Armenian, doctor/antiquarian named Doctor Caro
                    Minassian, who was one of the few good physicians of Isfahan. He was a leader of
                    the Armenian community, and an extremely learned man. We became very good
                    friends. He introduced us to the world of archaeology, antiquities and learning
                    in Isfahan. He cared for us medically on occasion when we were in need of help.
                    He and his wife were very, very good friends. He gave us an introduction to the
                    art and literature and history of Isfahan from the 16th century to the present
                    day. He himself was living example of a descendent of those Armenians who came
                    in the time of Shah Abbas and prospered in this Persian landscape.</p>
                <p>He also kept various animals in his garden next to ours, including, as I recall,
                    two enormous land tortoises. They were the size of coffee tables. They were
                    enormous. They were delight for children who would ride them. He had desert
                    birds and so on. He was a wonderful, wonderful maa kind of Dr. Doolittle.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>The consulate itself was made out of a 19th century building that had been a
                    merchants residence. It was basically an entry hall with one or two offices on
                    the ground floor for the Iranian staff of which we had three, not including the
                    guards. The senior Persian assistant was Baquer Dehesh, a courtly, very handsome
                    well educated well respected citizen of Isfahan. Mr. Dehesh, whose polite
                    manners exemplified the best of Iranian culture was educated in Tehran at Alborz
                    College under the legendary Dr. Jordan. Alborz College, a Presbyterian
                    missionary college which educated many of Iran's leaders during the 20s, 30s,
                    40s, and fifties. Mr. Dehesh was well known to all the key officials, bazaari,
                    clerics and tribal leaders of Isfahan and it was through Mr. Dehesh that I met
                    all the key leaders of Isfahan and was able to learn about many of the
                    particular ways of Isfahan. He and his wife made our entry into Isfahani life an
                    easy transition. There was also Khalil Ghazagh, who a was jack-of-all-trades
                    administrative assistanhe translated, he was the receptionist, he typed
                    unclassified material. He was an access to places and people that we needed.
                    Then there was a man named Sayed Soroosh, who was a university professor, but
                    was the assistant to the USIA, USIS person. He, of course, knew the university
                    people, and many of the learned of Isfahan.</p>
                <p>Then there was a third Persian named Abol Hassan Sepenta, a brilliant poet and
                    filmmaker who worked for the Americans because he needed money. He was also a
                    newspaper man, he was the editor of a one man Isfahan newspaper Spenta. He
                    became a very good friend right to the end, right to his death. He really knew
                    the country and loved its history and was a patriot in the full sense of the
                    word. He was a part of Persian history, certainly Persian cultural history, and
                    was very sensitive to current political movements and attitudes. Being a poet
                    himself, he was closely in touch with the fellow dissident poets, the poets of
                    the left, who tended to write what they called the “new poetry” that is, they
                    created new forms of poetry, writing not in the ghazals and the formal
                    structures of the past, but free verse, so to speak. The subject matter was very
                    direct and contemporary, a kind of realism at work. Through Sepenta I met the
                    poets and antiquarians and historians, politicians, and musicians, and those in
                    the theater of which there was a very interesting kind in Isfahan, as well as
                    many of the religious people. I met most of the leading mullahs (Islamic
                    clerics) in Isfahan, of all kinds, ranging from the most conservative to the
                    various Sufi sects.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>In fact, one of the very first official occasions I attended in Isfahan at the
                    suggestion of Sepenta was a funeral in the mosque which was down the street from
                    the consulate on the Chaharbagh, the main, ceremonial street of Isfahan. The
                    Chabar Bagh (four gardens) was built in the time of the Safavids, in the 16th
                    century. It has water courses down the middle of a broad avenue, with eight rows
                    of chenar, which is a kind of plane tree, ancient plane trees including some
                    that were planted in the time of the Safavids, a very beautiful avenue. The
                    funeral was for a poet who had just died. He was a reformist poet. I can recall
                    it very well because I had no idea what to expect. It turned out to be a most
                    courteous moving event at which I was given a place of honor, served a cup of
                    coffee, bitter coffee, and a cigarette. The mullahs were reciting suras
                    (chapters) from the Koran, Sufi poetry, and declaiming about the life of the
                    deceased poet. It was an auspicious beginning I thought, this very first
                    official act I did in Isfahan. The word got around Isfahan that I had gone to
                    the mosque. Sepenta knew what he was doing in suggesting going to events like
                    this funeral. It was clearly the right kind of introduction, the right first
                    step.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to step back. Where in 1959 did Isfahan fit into
                        the Iranian body politic, and what was going on in Iran at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, Isfahan is in the middle of this very large country, Iran. Tehran
                    is up in the north, eight hours by car. It's about 500 miles, one hour by plane.
                    It's the second city in size in Irait was then, and it is now. It was the
                    capital from the 16th century until the 19th century, and anyone with any sense
                    would still put the capital there, in the center of the country rather than
                    Tehran. It has sufficient water and the climate is excellent, ideal, but for
                    political reasons the Qajars, the successor dynasty to the Safavids, established
                    their capital in Tehran, to the north.</p>
                <p>At that time, Iran was organized into ten ostans as they were called in Persian,
                    ten states. Each state was governed by a governor called an Ostandar, and each
                    subsection of states, several counties or the equivalent would be under the
                    governance of a Farmandar who reported to the Ostandar. Then there was a mayor,
                    Shahrdar in the case of Isfahan, who was elected. This was from the time of the
                    Constitution in 1905. The mayors were elected. This was an understanding in the
                    1905 group and really, from that time on, that the people, or the major interest
                    groups of the regions, had to be given some authority. This was about as much
                    electoral power as they would permit in local elections. So mayors were elected,
                    even though the shah played a very significant role in selecting those who would
                    be allowed to run for the position. If necessary, he'd step in to assure or
                    prevenjust as the mullahs are doing now in some of the similar political
                    situations.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Isfahan was a very powerful placit was still a tribal centethat is, of the
                    Bakhtiar and Qashqai, who to some extent, had their influence in that region and
                    in the country. It was the largest industrial area at the time. The industry was
                    mostly in textile factories: weaving, cotton and silk and wool goods, as well as
                    the old style of manual manufacturinthat is what we would call handicrafts, but
                    they called essentials, the things of everyday life actually made in the
                    bazaars. So the bazaar was still the economic center of manufacture, finance,
                    politics, economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bazaaris are a distinct political group in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well they were the urban elite. They were the businessmen, those who had
                    money and economic power. The bazaar was the center of all Iranian cities, and
                    it still is. The Bazaar contained within itself, the heart of religion of
                    religious belief. Many of the older mosques originally endowed by the bazaari
                    were in the bazaar. The bazaar was a way of lifrestaurants, baths, as well as
                    shops, and places of manufacture, schools, seminaries, and residences. It was
                    the physical and cultural core of the old cities of Iran, as it was for much of
                    the Middle East. Cairo has somewhat similar structures, at least from Islamic
                    times, and even from before Islamic times. Isfahan, being an old city, one of
                    the oldest in Iran; it is an old city that goes back to about the 5th century
                    before the birth of Christ. Isfahan was the largest city in the Middle East
                    anmuch larger than London and probably any other city in the world at the time
                    of Shah Abbas around 1600. So it has visible accretive remains from the earliest
                    times, from pre-Christian times right to the present. The sense of a nation and
                    a people with a very long history is something you see every day, any Isfahani
                    knows this. He sees it in the buildings he lives in, and works in, and walks by.
                    Isfahani neighborhoods are defined by the establisheestablished over millennia -
                    economy, and even Isfahani ethnic backgrounds, were defined thousands of years
                    ago. Its Jewish center, for example, has been there from pre-Christian times.
                    The Armenians come late into the 16th century; they are there from Safavid
                    times. There are regions of Isfahan that are even now called Arab and Turkmen
                    and Afghan dating from the invasions of centuries past. Understandably Isfahan
                    is very complex architecturally, and even linguistically. Within the city there
                    are distinct dialects of language based on the great movements of people caused
                    by the invasions of past centuries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the overthrow of Mossadeq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the shah really in power, particularly from the
                        Isfahan ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MILLER: The Shah was never accepted by the Iranian peoples as a whole as the
                    rightful leader. The shah was always seen as illegitimate, as imposed by the
                    West, certainly from the time I got there. The Iranians believed that he had
                    been imposed by the British and by us, particularly the British. The line of
                    agreement that Iranian nationalists used when I arrived in 1959 was that we
                    Americans were manipulated by the hidden hand of the British. It was explained
                    to me by Iranians who had witnessed the events in great detail how the overthrow
                    took place. The role of Kermit Roosevelt, and Ambassador Henderson, and Shahban
                    the Brainless were all related by my new Isfahani friends who had lived through
                    all of the coups and had created a mythology, as well as a documented history
                    and a body of poetry of the event. The story of the 1953 coup was a favorite
                    subject matter for declamations. They saw to it that I was carefully educated in
                    what they regarded as Persian realities. Indeed I was educated, because I was
                    given full documentation, newspapers of the time, and met the personalities who
                    had been in prison, tortured. The American spies at the time were all
                    identified. I was actually asked, “Did I know so and so and so ...”</p>
                <p>It turned out that the governor, called in Persian, Ostandar, of Isfahan, a man
                    named General Abbas Farzanagan, had been the “bag man” for the coup, a fact that
                    he was pretty proud of. Farzanagan told me in detail his direct role in all of
                    these events. We became very good friends. I was very interested in him. He was
                    very pro-American, obviously, and very close to the Shah, but incredibly
                    corrupt, as I learned in watching him at work as governor. So the gap between
                    the governors of the shah and the shah's rule and the people of Isfahan, where I
                    was living, was evident almost from the beginning. There was little respect for
                    the shah among the Isfahani people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the shah himself rather than his father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The father was looked on with more respect, because he was a relatively
                    independent, self-made man. He was very tough soldier. He did his own thing. He
                    resisted cooption by foreign powers till the end, and of course was deposed
                    because of his recalcitrance, although he was a brutal dictator and ignorant in
                    the minds of many of the nationalists, and in their view not fit to be a great
                    king. Although they did accord him respect for the reforms he carried out such
                    as building railroads, and roads, airports, and the beginnings of a new system
                    of justice even though it was abused by him, used by him, for control rather
                    than justice. The path of change instituted by Reza Shah was seen to have
                    possibilities by the nationalists. For example, the new school system of course,
                    and universities, were seen as a plus. The beginnings of modern economy created
                    by the use of oil revenues from the oil fields in the south all took place under
                    the shah's father.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Shah Mohammed Reza, the son, was seen as weak, as a puppet of the Americans and
                    the British, particularly the British, and not worthy, and certainly by his own
                    example he did not do noble things. The nationalists who were the remnants and
                    successors to Mossadeq were the strongest most popular and respected political
                    groups in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Mossadeq viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: As the greatest of the Iranian leaders of the early 20th century, because
                    he came from a noble background and devoted his life to Iran and its people. He
                    was a Qajar, a prince, from a distinguished princely family. He was well
                    educated in Iran and in the West as a lawyer, was considered by all as a
                    patriot, was a nationalist who resisted British and Russian, and Reza Shah, went
                    to prison for it. Mossadeq was a land owner, who treated his villagers humanely,
                    a reformer, and a democrat. He believed in democratic institutions,
                    constitutionality, and legal reform. He understood the nature and history of
                    Iranian civilization. So he was thought by Iranians to be a great man, unfairly
                    and unwisely removed by foreign influence. It was a big mistake, in my view, for
                    the U.S. and Britain to have undertaken the 1953 coup.</p>
                <p>His group was called the National Front, Hesba Melli. It was a coalition of
                    interest groups and proto-political parties that reflected the whole spectrum of
                    Iranian society from the religious right to the Marxist, on the left, but it was
                    put together with a Persian perspective. The National Front Party was the
                    biggest political group in Isfahan. There were Communist elements within the
                    party, but they were a minority. The communist party, the Tudeh, were well
                    organized and well under the influence of Moscow because their leaders had been
                    educated in Moscow and their funding came from Moscow. Their social causes had
                    resonancthe urban poor, the exploitation of the masses were real issues. They
                    had some influence in the labor unions in the textile mills of Isfahan where
                    conditions were far from ideal. The Tudeh had no appeal in the villages, which
                    waat that point 70% of the population who lived in the 50,000 villages. The
                    communists were an urban phenomenon.</p>
                <p>So I was familiar with all these groups, the Communists, the Tudeh party, and
                    certainly the National Front people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tudeh was the Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Communists, yes. I also knew the SAVAK (National Organization for
                    Intelligence and Security) people who were hunting them down, arresting them and
                    killing them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How efficienand appreciated is really the wrong worwas the
                        SAVAK, or present at that time in Isfahan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MILLER: It was a very big presence, partially because SAVAK at that point was led
                    by a Bakhtiari General. Timor Bakhtiar was head of SAVAK, and he came from
                    Isfahan or in the mountains near Isfahan. He was a Bakhtiari. Yes, General Timor
                    Bakhtiar was head of SAVAK and he was considered a rival for the Shah for power
                    because he was a player and could easily have deposed the Shah, given certain
                    events and the attitude of the Americans and the British. The Americans and the
                    British kept very close touch with SAVAK since they were the main training group
                    for the secret police and supplied their equipment. We had a CIA (Central
                    Intelligence Agency) officer in Isfahan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now let's talk about the consulate, not
                        consulate-general ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There were five consulates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ? in Isfahan, at that time, because our reporting out of
                        Iran has been very, has been criticized, that sometimes were too much this
                        way or that way, you know. When you arrived what was sort of the attitude
                        and what was the task of the consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The consulate was really a kind of the consul was a pro-consul, in many
                    ways, because there was a huge economic and military assistance effort, Point
                    Four and ARMISH-MAAG effort underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Begun in the Truman administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was. Point Four was the forerunner to USAID (U.S. Agency for
                    International Development). The Point Four Plan, of course was, developed in the
                    time of Truman, for assistance to Greece, Turkey, and IraEgypt, as an emergency
                    foreign policy and security tool. That took the form of technical assistance,
                    largely in agriculture, health, and water projects, airports, infrastructure,
                    and there were quite a few aid technicians who gave, in many cases, extremely
                    effective help, particularly the doctors in the universities and hospitals. The
                    development assistance of Point Four was extremely helpful to Iran.</p>
                <p>Then we also had a very large ARMISH-MAAG (US Army Mission Military Assistance
                    Advisory Group) contingent. ARMISH-MAAG was the military, the military security
                    assistance. It was under the command of a general who wanted to assist a
                    military academy in Isfahan, particularly giving access to artillery and tanks.
                    We had a large military training component, a feature that lasted until the
                    revolution in 1979. At the end, in 1979 they had air force training in Isfahan,
                    and of course Bell Helicopters was building helicopters in Isfahan, and
                    communications factories.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Then there were training and technical programs in all of the structurethe
                    police, the gendarmerie, doctors' education. So the consulate was in formal
                    charge of all of this. As vice-consul I was in charge of all of this when Frank
                    Crawford was on leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were just two of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There were two Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The CIA station chief, the USIS officer, later Bill Meader and the Point
                    Four head, Harvey Coverley and John Hollligsworth, our administrative assistant
                    and code clerk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the CIA officeperform consular functions too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Reluctantly. He was a good man. We went on many field trips together. He
                    was helpful. I learned much from him about CIA, and the mentality of those
                    engaged in covert activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about just the mundanbut Iranian students were the
                        bane of most consuls existence in Europe and elsewhere cause they were all
                        over the place looking for visas. Did you have that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I had to issue visas. It was my first post, I expected to issue visas. I
                    issued about 50 a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's not many.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, and I even issued four passports, two of which I mangled in the seal
                    embossing machine. We had a malfunctioning hand crank machine. I couldn't get
                    several of the passports out of the machine. It was a rather comic scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then mainly your work was ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MILLER: I was the political officer, I was the economic officer, I was the
                    coordinator of our mission and I was the deputy chief of mission, and I helped
                    in communications. I did everything. I encrypted, decrypted, acted as a courier
                    as way of getting to Tehran and so on. There wasn't any consular function I
                    didn't do. I buried the dead. I picked up pieces of Americans who crashed
                    themselves into the top of mountains, put dead bodies in embalming fluid and
                    then put them in caskets. I got American travelers out of jail. I went to the
                    ports to handle shipping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did people get in jail there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The normal ways, traffic accidents, or theft ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was drugs a problem at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, not noticeably. You have to remember this was really and still is a
                    very remote part of the world. The only people who came through were the most
                    adventurous and of course, there were those who were often traveling on 50 cents
                    a day of their own and ten dollars of someone else's money a day. Some travelers
                    proved to be burdens because they expected to be put up in your house or your
                    apartment. Most travelers to Isfahan tended to be wonderful people like Agatha
                    Christie, otherwise known as Mrs. Mallowan and her archaeologist husband. There
                    were people like Anne K. Hamilton, the quiet Persian scholar who was a British
                    Political officer during the war. Also Lawrence Lockhart, the art historian and
                    historian of the Safavid period; Donald Wilber, and Cuyler Young and his
                    archaeologist son, T. Cuyler Young, Jr. came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an archeologist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Another extraordinary person was Wilfred Thesiger, a great explorer,
                    and of course all the archeologists in the region like Ezatollah Negahban, many
                    of whom are now gone, but some of them are still alive and working, like David
                    Stronach, who was head of the British Institute and is now at Berkley in
                    California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With these connections you were developing, in the first
                        place the language. I imagine this was a hot house for getting into Farsi
                        and Persian.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Well, immediately upon arriving I had a tutor, several tutors. Since
                    there were very few people in Isfahan who spoke English or any other foreign
                    language, you had to learn Persian. It was a wonderful obligation and necessity.
                    The atmosphere in Isfahan was such that the rhythm of life and the language fit
                    it. It was a good place to begin to learn a language as subtle as Persian. The
                    pace of life allowed me the luxury of having tutors during the day in the
                    office. I rarely sat for a whole day at the desk. The paper work was minimal
                    since we were a consulate in a very remote area. The traffic of consular work
                    wasn't, even in the embassies, anywhere near the scale we have now. It was
                    expected that my job was to learn about Iran, so I was on the streets of Isfahan
                    every day. Two weeks of every month I was on the road in other parts of Iran.
                    Over the five years that I was in Iran I visited every part of Iran. I've been
                    to every city, most towns, and there is no region that I haven't visited, and
                    almost every archeological site, every mosque. I met every major religious
                    leaders, every political leader throughout the country. So I knew the country
                    backwards and forwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any restrictions or no-nos? For example, you
                        said the governor was incredibly corrupt, though he was a nice man. Was this
                        a matter of reporting all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: How did I know that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you know that and also were you reporting
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, I was reporting the issues as I understood them. Yes, I reported
                    on corruption and popular discontent with the Shah's regime from the outset. To
                    do so wasn't a problem for political officers in the field. It did get to be a
                    problem for me in Tehran. I'll tell you about that later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am trying to pick up now because our work in Iran later
                        on, particularly in the 70's, was renowned for restrictions put on our
                        officers about reporting. What about then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No restrictions. The only curbs on one's writing were technical
                    considerations of formal style, punctuation, and normal editing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were done mainly through dispatches?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>MILLER: The major reporting form was the “dispatch”, and “official informal”
                    letters. The major security categories for reporting were “limited official use”
                    or “unclassified”, because we didn't want to go through the very onerous,
                    time-consuming task of encryptiousing one time pads. Any messages that required
                    one-time pads really had to be a sensitive issue. Everything else was understood
                    to be normal discourse in Isfahan: such matters as so-and-so is corrupt, that
                    the SAVAK killed so-and-swere reported in unclassified form. The only thing that
                    might have been put in classified form would be a comment on the event that was
                    being reported, for example. Security regulations required that our classified
                    material had to be sent by courier, hand-carried. Getting classified material to
                    Tehran was not a problem, but every encryption certainly was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your contact and all with the mullahs at that
                        time. How did this come about? Were the mullahs sort owere they open to a
                        young kid from the American devils or something, coming around and talking
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, after all the mullahs were and still are, by and large, and
                    certainly in the cities, among the most educated. They're the brothers and
                    cousins of people who were leading politicians and businessmen. The mullahs were
                    supported by the others in society in the same way we support our pastors and
                    priests here in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not really a class apart.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the mullahs were an integrated part of everyday life. It is a
                    mistake, to look on mullahs even in contemporary Iran as a class that is somehow
                    alienated. What's wrong or different for the clergy to be doing in contemporary
                    Iran as compared to the traditional Iran that I knew is that the clergy are now
                    doing functions that they normally don't do. The clergy are running the
                    government, but the clergy come from the same families whose secular members ran
                    the Shah's government. They are relatives of the politicians who were in power
                    at the time of the shah.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MILLER: Suzanne found it completely open. Perhaps because we were young and
                    na�ve, we felt no isolation or alienation. The people we lived among were
                    interested in us. We had our first son born in Isfahan, in a simple but well run
                    hospital there. She had a normal birth with a mid-wife. It was the Christian
                    hospital run by the Christian Church. The hospital was made of mumud brick, and
                    it was very primitive in its appointments, but had extremely able doctors and
                    nurses. No, Suzanne had a wonderful time. There was no restriction on dress, but
                    she was careful about what she wore. She would wheel a baby carriage, with our
                    son, Will, down the main streets. Isfahani women would stop her and chat about
                    the baby and the normal events of ordinary life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes. We would go on picnics in the mountains, find a deserted place
                    and almost by magic tribesman would come down from the hills and surround us,
                    inching up closer and closer with when we were having a picnic, and if we had
                    enough food, we'd share it with them and they'd squat and look at our baby and
                    ask questions like, “how did we get so far away from America?” “What is America
                    like?” they were always courteous and respectful and genuinely curious about
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With our military mission there, did that cause problems?
                        Sometimes you take young American soldiers, and they've got spare time, and
                        sometimes it goes bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: A little bit. They usually went up to Tehran or out of the country for a
                    change and for recreation. The social life that went on was open enough. The
                    Iranian military was there too. The American advisors were a tiny part of the
                    much larger Iranian military force of several divisions. The Iranian military as
                    a whole were seen as somewhat parasitical on the society, as were the police,
                    because being poorly paid, they did put pressure on the ordinary people and
                    extract bribes. The military weren't always of the finest type, but they
                    functioned in Isfahan in a situation of normality, I'd say. You asked the
                    question about mullahI was very interested in them because they knew a lot about
                    their country, were generally well educated and well read and the best were well
                    informed about events in the world. And they were political leaders. They were
                    political in the sense that they were aware, remembered the recent past, and
                    were related to people who were political. They had admirable moral attitudes,
                    and some were highly civilized. It wasn't difficult to get to know the clergy.
                    If you were interested in them, they were interested in you. If you treated them
                    with respect, they treated you with respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the land owners? Had the White Revolution
                        started at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, the White Revolution took place later when I went to Tehran.
                    So-called land reform was the biggest part of the White Revolution. This big
                    issue in the World Bank at that time was assisting land reform program. Land
                    reform in the early1960s meant land distribution. It didn't mean necessarily
                    improving the agriculture, it meant democratizing by parceling out equal plots
                    to the peasants in the minds of Western, or at least foreign, economists.</p>
                <p>Change in the patterns of land ownership had already begun in Iran as early as
                    the '20s, because owning villages and peasants was no longer a benefit. Land
                    ownership for thousands of years in Iran was seen as a prestige, power, and it
                    was clearly in 1960, ceasing to be that. The big land-owning families, the
                    so-called “1000 Families” of Iran, who typically would own 10, 20, 50, or even
                    100 villages, were selling their villages and going into manufacturing or
                    investment. There was a very famous family called the Farman-Farmians in Tehran
                    descended from the Qajar princes. In the generation I knew. there were 36
                    children from one father and four mothers. 32 of them were PhD's. The
                    Farman-Farmians were a huge land-owning family, but at that time in 1962, they
                    reduced their holdings to just two villages where they had homes they used for
                    vacations and hunting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they sold their villages, would it go to somebody
                        else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the villages were sold in the bazaar, and rich merchants who were
                    rising and wanted villages as prestige bought them. The process of change was
                    slow.</p>
                <p>The decision to sell or keep a village would depend on the quality of the
                    village, whether it was profitable, very often there was prestige to own a
                    village particularly in the marginal areas. Agriculture itself as an economic
                    force was changing. Certainly, the methods of agriculture were changing.
                    Typically water was the limiting and governing principle or, in the areas of
                    rainfall, predictable rainfall, where wheat could be grown without fear of
                    drought, or rice would be grown in the north, where there was plentiful rainfall
                    for ice and for crops like tea, or fruit orchards. Water was a key determinant.
                    If you bought a village you'd have to know how much water came with the village.
                    Water would define how many people could work and how much land could be
                    planted. For thousands of years in Iran, the measurement of work was by how much
                    land could be plowed by a man and an ox in a day. Land divisions, so-called,
                    were based on that man-ox scale of measurement. With mechanization, in the
                    twentieth century, the nature of plowing and land division and irrigation was
                    changing. Land reform did not significantly affect overall output, really, but
                    it was driving people off the land. The traditional agriculture was a form of
                    intensive farming; so-called land reform, actually drove half of the village
                    workers into the cities unnecessarily, unnecessarily because they were living
                    quite a reasonable life in the villages. If better education and health were
                    provided to the villages you would have had a much better situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What with the clearances_________?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes it is. It was something like that, not intended with that in mind.
                    This class of people driven to the cities were called Khoshnashin. They were the
                    so-called “landless.” They were the workers in villages, they were the ones who
                    didn't have land tenure by family inheritance because they had ploughed the same
                    plots for hundreds of years, but were otherwise involved in harvesting and
                    planting and did other jobs in the village. It changed the nature of villages,
                    so-called land reform. Land reform as conceived in the 1960's was an
                    inappropriate idea imposed by Western land reform theorists who tried to apply
                    methods used elsewhere on a very complicated traditional land system.</p>
                <p>This is how Mossadeq come back into the picture. Mossadeq was deeply interested
                    in land reform. He was a big landowner, and understood well the complications.
                    He said, “First step for reform of Iranian agriculture was to make a national
                    cadastral survey. It was necessary to determine what kind of land Iran has, then
                    determine how can it best be farmed, how many workers would be able to usefully
                    work on it. What about village schools, and social infrastructure once provided
                    by landlords.” If the land is to use machinery what would be the optimum kinds
                    of tractors, combines, etc. Mossadeq asked, “What have you got in the villages
                    before you change them?” The Shah's White Revolution, was led by Minister of
                    Agriculture, Arsenjani, who was the real architect but didn't know a damn thing
                    about agriculture. He was a city, urban type, a journalist actually, who was
                    drafted by the Shah to be Minister of Agriculture. Arsenjani bought the World
                    Bank theory which had little to do with the agricultural and social and
                    political realities of Iran.</p>
                <p>The landowners over the last several hundred years represented a significant part
                    of the ruling elite. In the last 50 years of the twentieth century, ownership of
                    land meant far less, and in the last 10 years before the revolution land owners
                    had very little direct influence. It was those who had factories and had
                    invested in bankand those who were making modern mechanical thingcars and the
                    machines of the new world.</p>

                        and overthrow of the shah? Were we looking for revolutionary elements, even
                        the Tudeh?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MILLER: We were helping the Shah to suppress the Tudehs. We were trying to root
                    them out. All opposition to the Shah was suspect, even democratic nationalists.
                    This was our policy towards Iran from the time of the overthrow of Mossadeq in
                    1953. It was certainly a major policy concern in the Eisenhower period. In the
                    Kennedy periowhen I was in Iran, the question of crushing the opposition was
                    open. The idea that a democratic nationalist opposition was positive and should
                    be supported was left open. After I left, starting with Nixon, our policy
                    changed back to total support for the shah at all costs. In the period from
                    Kennedy through Johnson, we placed high value on building democratic government
                    and institutions, supporting democratic government with all the confusion of
                    ignorance of the regional realities and history, and our inabilities in many
                    ways, but the issue of governance was open and the American government was
                    listening to nationalist expression, cooperatively at least, in Iran, Turkey,
                    even Egypt and other places. We had in fact, a sort of schizophrenic policy. On
                    the one hand we were supporting SAVAK, the secret police, to keep the shah in
                    power, and supporting brutal police tactics, supporting undemocratic brutality;
                    on the other hand we were urging Iranian judges to follow a democratic system of
                    rule of law and to hold free elections. Election would be held by the shah. They
                    were rigged. They weren't free, and to our credit, we condemned them. The Shah
                    would hold elections again. They still weren't free. The shah was under
                    tremendous pressure from us to allow the national democrats to have a role in
                    government for about four years, during the time I was there.</p>
                <p>President Kennedy, Attorney Bobby Kennedy his NSC (National Security Council),
                    and his State Department regional bureau, NEA, all were in support of the
                    nationalists, perhaps because the Iranian nationalists were American-educated
                    and a known quantity. They were thought to be the best elements within Iranian
                    society and they came directly to us for help. They said, “We believe in you.
                    You should believe in us.” There was a policy battle between the supporters of
                    the Shah's absolute rule and those who wanted Iran to have a constitutional
                    democratic monarchy. The battle for policy went on until a decision was made in
                    the time of Prime Minister Ali Amini, on the question of an IMF (International
                    Monetary Fund) debt repayment. It was an amount of debt something like $20
                    million, which, if we had given him a delay on debt payment, Amini would have
                    survived. The decision was made not to support Amini's request, but rather to
                    support the shah, so the shah became the “linchpin of stability” at that point.
                    That marked the end of independent, democratic parties. The shah, from that
                    point on, put in place a shah chosen one-party system. There were elections for
                    the representatives of one party. The nationalists democrats were prevented from
                    that point on by the shah from holding office.</p>

                        bit abouyou said you wanted to talk about, particularly the work of a

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There is some present day relevance to the pro-consuls that are in place
                    in Afghanistan, or are being put in place in Iraq. Isfahan was not a primitive
                    place. It was a highly cultured city with a thousand-year history or more and a
                    population that knew that history and behaved in customary ways that were
                    reflective of a highly civilized society. What I mean by that is that the daily
                    courtesies of life were highly stylized. Greetings were expected and formalized,
                    whether on the street or in arranged or formal meetingpassing by on the street
                    with strangers, comment on the weather. The discussion of everyday events was
                    carefully considered through formulaic language, which, when fully understood,
                    wasn't simply a matter of rote, but could subtly convey very accurate and direct
                    feelings.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give sort of an example of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, a very popular thoroughfare in Isfahan was called the Chaharbagh,
                    the Place of Four Gardens. That's what the word means. It was then and still is,
                    as I saw when I returned a year or so ago, a street several miles in length in
                    which there are four rows of plane trees, sycamores to us, London planes, to the
                    British, some of which are hundreds of years old. It's a place where people
                    promenade, really. In Persian it's called gardesh mikonan, “we will take a
                    walk,” and people go in one direction or the other and when they pass each other
                    they nod heads and they have a salutation of at minimum, “Al-salaam Alaikum, to
                    your health,” comment would than follow on the weather, politics, the health of
                    family and friends and perhaps more. These are the patterns of daily ordinary
                    walks. Then there were conversations in the market if you're buying fruit or
                    vegetables. At the other end of the scale of commerce, in antique or rug stores,
                    for example, there is a formal language, and patter that reflects not only the
                    occupation of the day and the feelings towards individuals or even
                    countries.</p>
                <p>This is a way of saying that Iranian society is very complicated. The language is
                    very precise and learned. There is a lot of room for discussion, not only
                    banter, but deep discussion within formulas. So for diplomats the use of
                    language is ideal because you are already working within mental frameworkrules
                    of the game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem beginning to pick up the nuances of

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, and here is the importance of local staff who, in this case, were
                    like Oriental secretaries in the British sense. Our local staff were people of
                    great standing in the city, in this case, Isfahan, because of their family and
                    educational background and learning. They saw their jobs as being a host for the
                    city; to the Americans in a way, and as teachers to the Americans. So every
                    step, particularly in the early stages, everything was explained, what these
                    encounters meant, what the meaning and intentions of the linguistic back and
                    forth was, what the depth of the bow or the rising or falling if you are sitting
                    on the ground, and hand to the heart and the stroking of beardin the case of the
                    religious who were always bearded meant. Those clues to behavior were very

                    filmmaker, and a journalisI spent a lot of time both of with them. They took me
                    to see their circles of close friends as well as those in official circles. In
                    the official circles were the governor of the ostan, Ostandar, the mayor, the
                    Shahdar, the various heads of ministries in the governor's and the mayor's
                    office, then the leading clerics, university professors, teachers in the
                    schools, artists. A list of the hierarchy of important people, was drawn up. All
                    consulates and embassies have a list of key personalities and their
                    biographiecontact lists they are now called. In the case of Isfahan and Tehran,
                    the personalities were divided into the appropriate classes of society, not in
                    the Marxist way, but in the Persian way which was in the form of a list of those
                    who were the worthies, who were the land-owners, who were the factory owners,
                    who were the intellectuals, artists, athletes, actors, etc. The initial analysis
                    of society was carefully done and reflected not our perception of society but
                    our local staff's perception of their own social structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A worthy being whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: A “worthy” would be, so named for one of several reasons. A worthy would
                    reflect power, that is, be a representative of the shah's regime, the appointed
                    governor, in the case of Isfahan and the elected mayor, the head of the
                    gendarmerie, or the head of the secret police. Then there were the families of
                    the existing dynasty, that's the Pahlavis, and then the Qajars, who were much
                    more numerous, from the previous dynasty, and in the case of Isfahan the
                    Safavids from the time of shah Abbas, that great Persian dynasty. There were
                    even some Afshars, the dynasty from Shiraz, and there were some families of the
                    Afghan conquerors of the 18th century, and so on, and there were Jewish
                    worthies, Christians. There were also the leaders of, the various modern oil
                    dynasties, or the present political system, the religious structure, the
                    intellectual structure. Then in Isfahan, because it was always an artisan city,
                    the artists, the most honored miniaturists, tile makers, and in the time I was
                    there, the sculptors and the oil painters or water colorists. All of the
                    artistfrom metal work to textiles to bookbindinthese were all very
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no strictures within the Shiite religion about
                        portraying human people, the humans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Only in the mosques.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Only in the mosques, but you know in the Wahabi and all
                        this, there is none of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, in fact, in a number of the great mosques, even the shah mosque, now
                    called the Imam mosque, there were representations of animals and humans in some
                    of the back areas of the mosque. Usually there is a distinction between the
                    mosque and outside, but outside it was rampant, figures and animals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may have asked this before, but how strong was the writ
                        of the shah at this time? How much were local authorities doing what local
                        authorities do, and how much was it deferring to the shah?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The hierarchy of power was at the head was the shah, the shah made the
                    claim, and of course, his entourage and many throughout the country believed,
                    that Iran was the shah, that he owned the country, but in the vibrant urban life
                    of cities like Isfahan and Shiraz and Tabriz this dominance was contested by
                    those of great wealth and long held social position. They thought they also had
                    a piece of the country to which they had claim. The shah needed them as well to
                    stay in power. That vitiated absolute power to some extent. The clergy were
                    always split on the question of loyalty to the shah as the “Render unto
                    Caesar...” was a reality and the spiritual life didn't belong to the shah, he
                    had to belong to the spiritual life as a kind of defender, or as more accurate,
                    in his case, persecutor of the faith.</p>
                <p>There was a well known hierarchal list of power of so called “1,000 Families” who
                    were the great land owners of Iran. Many on the list were from the previous
                    timeQajars, Safavids or the great bazaar merchants, Isfahan of course having the
                    most extensive and complicated bazaar. These bazaar families were
                    extraordinarily important. They were the financial support necessary for the
                    regime. They were also the support for the clerical establishment through
                    charitable contributions on the vaqf, the inheritance, and they were political
                    powers in their own right. Of course, commercial activity was crucial to the
                    society as a whole.</p>
                <p>Those were the worthies. Isfahan was a wonderful place for anyone interested in
                    learning about the complexities and richness of Iran, particularly one from the
                    United States. A diplomat at that time was welcome. I learned about Iranian
                    society in ways that were much superior to the method imposed upon embedded
                    journalists, for example, now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got outsidtalk about consulate trips, too. When
                        you got outside going into your area, which is quite an extensive one, how
                        did you feel about what you were picking from this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was a huge consulate district. It extended to the Afghan border on the
                    east, included the religious city of Qom in the north, it went to the Iraqi
                    border on the west, the Persian Gulf to the south, and everything in between. It
                    was a vast piece of territory, with huge variations of kinds of life.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Typically, I would spend at least a week or two every month on the road. The
                    trips were primarily by jeep, because the cities and the settlements and
                    villages were great distances between each other. The distances between
                    settlements were due to the largely desert character of the plateau. Villages
                    existed where there was water. The roads were very difficult; at best they were
                    corrugated dirt roads. Travel anywhere meant adventure.</p>
                <p>So I would have our great driver, Khachik, and one of the Oriental secretaries
                    would often go along. A good example would be a trip to Yazd, which is to the
                    east of Isfahan and over a range of mountains to the edge of the desert, Dasht-e
                    Lut. The trip to Yazd would take about five or six hours. Yazd, itself had an
                    extensive bazaar, several important mosques, seminaries. It had a full
                    government structure. It had a governor, a mayor and an apparatus that was
                    similar to Isfahan but smaller, and of a different ethnic composition. These
                    trips would be prepared in advance, notice was sent from Isfahan's governor that
                    an American diplomatic official was coming, and the governor requested “would
                    you meet, and prepare all necessary meetings.” There would be meetings with the
                    worthies of the city. First, in that case, there was the meeting with the
                    governor and then the mayor, and other city officials. We had “Point Four” an
                    aid mission there, so it was necessary to visit the Point 4 projects. Then I'd
                    go to each of the main mosques and meet the chief clerics, the mullahs. In each
                    of these places there would be at minimum, tea, and very often dinner, lunch and
                    dinner. We'd stay in a guest house, usually in the compound of the richest
                    worthy in town. They would lay out the carpet, literally. The guest house
                    usually contained a courtyard, a house with a big room with carpets, and padded
                    mats, which we slept on, and servants would bring food and water. There would be
                    a shower. Jeep trips through the mountains and deserts on very dusty roads found
                    us covered in dust from head to toe. Showers were a blessing. A bath in a hammaa
                    clean bath house, was even better. Then we'd have dinner at the host's house and
                    with his guests.</p>
                <p>We'd spend several days in a city like Yazd, carrying out formal visits to the
                    formal governmental and social structures of the city. Then we'd go touring. I
                    was and still am an insatiable amateur archeologist, so every mound that we'd
                    see from the road, I would ask that we'd stop so I could gather shards and check
                    the shards against the examples showed in the various manuals that I had brought
                    along. In the case of Yazd, we went up into the mountains to the west of Yazd,
                    and visited the Zoroastrians who lived in villages outside of Yazd, the
                    surviving indigenous Zoroastrian community that goes back over thousands of
                    years. We visited the religious centethe fire templwe were invited to a
                    Zoroastrian religious service which was quite an honor. The religious precepts
                    were explained, and the life of the village was described. They even took us to
                    the Towers of Silence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where they put the bodies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MILLER: The Towers of Silence are the stone structures where they exposed the
                    dead bodies of the Zoroastrians faithful to the elements and the carrion birds.
                    There were also tribal groups nearby, so we paid a visit to the tribal leaders.
                    The Yazd trip was one typical trip. Another kind of which I made several would
                    be to go all the way to the Persian Gulf. This was a three week trip through
                    Shiraz and through Qashqai lands and further in Arab tribal country. In this
                    first case, the purpose was t meet with the leaders of the Qashqai. The Qashqai
                    were one of the two most important tribes in Iran. The Bakhtiari who lived in
                    the Zagros Mountains north of Shiraz up to Khorramabad was the other main tribal
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say tribes, were these, would you call them, I
                        meathese werone of the terms I use is Arabs or Persians? Were there any
                        Arabs per se?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Only near the Shat-al-Arab River near Khorramshahr were there Arab
                    tribes, and along the Persian Gulf there werArab tribal groups which were called
                    Bandari (along the shore), which werpart of a separate Persian Gulf culture. The
                    Persian Gulf was very different than mainland Iraq or Iran. They were inhabited
                    by different kinds of people. There were obviously also mixtures of Arabs,
                    Indians and Pakistanis who plied the coastal waters of the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The dhow trade and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There were at that time dhow shipyards. They were still making wooden
                    dhows by hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I used to see them when I would go to Qatar in the late
                        '50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Exactly. One trip, I tooa very long difficult one along the Persian Gulf
                    started in Bandar-e Abbas, and then we went on running along the coast in a
                    jeep. It was very difficult, very difficult. We went all the way to Chahbahar in
                    one direction (to the east) and to Bushire, to the west. There were still pearl
                    fisheries, working with great heaps of oyster shells in evidence. There were
                    wonderful crafts evident in the buildings of the Gulf towns, the ornamented
                    wooden doors that were carved out of teak. They brought the teak from India and
                    further east. There was a very different feeling in the Persian Gulf from the
                    rest of Iran. The Gulf was really the Ali Baba kind of world. Do you remember
                    the huge pots in the stories about Ali Baba? There they were, these huge pots,
                    filled with water in the basements. The Gulf people used to go into the water
                    pots to cool off, when it was an unbearably hot day.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>On several of those trips I went out to the islands by dhow. There are dozens of
                    islands that lie off the coast, and several of them were then used as fortresses
                    and prisons including prisons for political prisoners and there were also mines,
                    for iron oxide and various salts. The mountainous islands were made up of
                    spectacular colorred, yellow, pink, great veins, of different colored rock. The
                    volcanic and violent nature of the area's geology was very evident. We'd get out
                    there by dhow. We'd hire a dhow and sail and shove off into the very blue waters
                    of the Gulf sailing before the wind under the characteristic rig of a lateen
                    sail. It was really a great adventure. I can remember a very hot day when we
                    sailed out to Hormoz Island. Hormoz was used as a prison for political
                    prisoners. It had been an important Portuguese port, and a commercial center, in
                    the 17th century, of the Portuguese Empire. The Portuguese fort was still thera
                    very handsome ruin, a lovely, spectacular place. The sea around Hormoz was alive
                    with fish. I remember going swimming right off the shore by the fort. It was
                    very hot and it was wonderful to be able to go swimming. There were oyster beds
                    right underfoot. So I picked the oysters, and even though they were forbidden
                    for the Muslim pious, I found them delicious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were on these things was there a different
                        viedid you have a feeling that the further you got away from the centers
                        like Isfahan and all, these communities were running by their own writ and
                        the shah waand higher government was less important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, very definitely, but the network still was always evident even if
                    distant. The sense of Iran as a nation was something that you began to
                    understand, how the country fitted together even though the vast distances and
                    isolation, and the autonomies were very evident. A good example of this is,
                    again, in the tribeI went on one occasion, on a tribal migration with the
                    Bakhtiari. I had friends in Isfahan who were living there as exiled tribal
                    chiefs, Bakhtiari chiefs. They were not allowed to be with the tribes, because
                    ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Bakhtiari were located where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In the Zagros Mountains from south of Kermanshah all the way to Shiraz,
                    and then the Qashqai lands begin in the Shiraz area and go south to Firuzabad.
                    The Bakhtiari were divided into various clans that were loyal to different
                    tribal chiefs. The main clans were called Haft Lang and the Chahar Lang, that's
                    “seven” and “four.” The clans would wear a typical canvas woven tunic above
                    their shalvar (wide, broad trousers), shirts that button up to their necks and
                    who wore a distinctive domed hat, black hat made of goat hair. They were stripes
                    on the tunics: four stripes for the Chahar Lang and seven stripes for the Haft
                    Lang. The two main clans got along reasonably well except for occasional
                    disputes along the migration routes and where the sheep would graze on to
                    disputed grasslands and domestic conflicts would emerge.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The migration trip was hosted by a Haft Lang family whose lands extended from the
                    north near Khorramabad across the Zagros Mountains down to Masjed-e Soleyman in
                    the flat lands near Iraq, which is where the oil fields were in Khuzestan. This
                    migration was a three week trip on horseback. It was a marvelous, absolutely
                    marvelous experience. The host was a Kalantar, a tribal leader of several
                    families. A Kalantar is a second level retainer to the Khan who is the leader of
                    the tribe. There were about eight families who were traveling with their flocks
                    of sheep along with the Kalantars group. The migration follows at the pace of
                    the sheep. The families travel only as far as the sheep could go in a day. Then
                    they'd stop and eat and set up their black tents, cook dinner and would remain
                    for a few days during which they would go hunting, engage in story-telling, and
                    feasting, of course until the sheep were ready to move again to new pastures. We
                    followed that pattern of travel over three weeks. Up and down mountains,
                    swimming across rivers with the sheep, back up the mountain and down again.</p>

                        wiser, certainly more indulgent, Foreign Service then we have today, where

                        the world which you were dealing with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was learning about an important part of Iran and I hope I was also
                    making friends. As far as establishing a relationship with people of another
                    country, this is a very pleasant way to do it. It's a great privilege to be
                    invited to live for a time with the tribes, particularly if they have invited
                    you to come as their guests. We were welcome. It was an ideal time for us, as
                    Americans. Americans were then believed to the real friends of Iran and its
                    independence despite the 1953 coup. For the Iranians, Americans were thought to
                    be relatively innocent, even na�ve, to the Iranians, the British were “the
                    hidden hand”. The British were always suspect, although much respected for their
                    power The Russians were long perceived as an enemy not to be trusted from the
                    earlier times of Russian expansion in the early 19th century. The Soviets were
                    certainly believed to be an enemy. The U.S. was 10,000 miles away so we were
                    believed to have no direct territorial interests even though we had overthrown
                    Mossadeq, their beloved, popular leader. The Iranians tended to blame that
                    action on the British having duped us because we were naive and the British, of
                    course, were always thought to be highly intelligent and conservatively
                    devious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In all this, both in Isfahan and going out, how would you
                        describe the power of the mullahs because we are comparing this to today
                        where apparently the mullahs have seized control of most elements of
                        government. How did you find it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MILLER: The mullahs were, at that time, an integral part of society. They had a
                    normal role, not unlike the role of religious people in our own country. Most
                    Iranian families had relatives who were clerics. It wasn't the first profession.
                    It was not the last, but religion was always seen as a matter of personal faith
                    that should be removed from political society, let's put it that way. The
                    mullahs were always thought to have at least some learning, even in the
                    villages. They were until recently the teachers of the children, particularly in
                    the villages. They taught in the maktabs (schools) up to the third grade. That's
                    why so many Iranian in the remotest places could read and write, because of the
                    mullahs who lived there. Of the 50,000 villages I'd say at least 2/3 had mullahs
                    in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't see them as a potential threat for us or
                        anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Some did, yes. I had a colleague who was fascinated by the mullahs. He
                    made following mullah activity his main work. That was what he was really
                    interested in. He came to this interest from the time of the assassination of
                    Prime Minister Razmara by the Fedayeen in the 1950s, the mullahs who were
                    violent, who were the assassins, who were the vengeful “jihadists” as we would
                    now call them, were the most irrational and potentially dangerous. In the time I
                    was in Iran I, met some of the Fedayeen remnants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does Fedayeen mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It means “warriors of God.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Warriors of God,” is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, or Fedayeen. They believe themselves to be the soldiers of the
                    faith. They were of course a minority among the clergy but they were fanatically
                    convinced of their convictions. Extremism of the kind used by Fedayeen was
                    always a fringe element of the religious community and a very small part of the
                    religious structure. I made a point of meeting every cleric that I could simply
                    because they were an essential part of society and I was interested in them.
                    Many of the religious leaders became friends. I would see them in normal
                    circumstances, and it was perfectly acceptable for us to be friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, going back to my Foreign Service history, I
                        think we lost at least one consular officer in Iran, by a mob, who made the
                        wrong kind of gesturnot necessarily a rude gesture, but some how got a mob
                        incited.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, we had one officer who was murdered by a mob. The Russian emissary
                    was torn apart by a mob in the early 19th century because he was rumored to have
                    defiled a sacred place. It was long before the Bolsheviks. If Russians had
                    listened to their Oriental secretaries they wouldn't have gotten into such a
                    dangerous fatal situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keep from making the wrong kind of gestures at the wrong
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Most clerics were and are perfectly normal people. In Isfahan, which has
                    hundreds of mosques, I, because of my interest in Iranian architecture, went to
                    every one. I photographed them all and described them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have any problem going in or anything like

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I was always welcome in the mosques and holy shrines, but I was
                    always very careful to have a clerical host. This was made clear to me by my
                    Persian mentors that I was coming into another man's house. I was told, “He will
                    welcome you as your guest, but he has to welcome you.” Visits to the holy places
                    were easily arranged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think back to my time slightly before this, '58 to '60,
                        in eastern province of Saudi Arabia where the Wahabis, you just steered

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Field trips were also a way of getting to know and work with other parts
                    of our government. I would takI took a number of trips with spooks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain, for the non-initiate, what spook
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: An employee of CIA, usually a case officer. A characteristic of embassies
                    and consulates symptomatic of the structure of our foreign affairs in the 60's,
                    was the extensive CIA case officer presence within embassies and diplomatic
                    establishments. It wathis is a reflective, after the fact thought that such a
                    presence was a mistake, because most of the case officers were doing things that
                    political officers of the Foreign Service should normally dthat is, make
                    contacts and friends. The CIA approach was to buy informants and information
                    from among their contacts, which I thought was a huge unnecessary mistake since
                    Iran was an open society. If information was needed, it was only necessary to
                    ask.</p>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MILLER: Very ephemeral. It's only there as long you are tolerated. There were a
                    number of occasions where I had friends who were being pursued by case officers
                    in order to put them on the payroll of the case officer. It was proprietary
                    distinction made which I thought was unseemly and unnecessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would imagine that at a certain point just to get
                        a feel for this, within a bureaucracy, that if you took a case officer with
                        you, you'd be reluctant to bring them up against one of your friends or a
                        good contact because you're afraithey could poison the well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: As it happened, no. That was certainly always a possibility, but the
                    Iranians knew who the spooks were. There was never any question in their mind
                    and they saw the United States government as a wholwhether you were a diplomat
                    or a spook, it was the United States. It was only after that was understood that
                    they made a distinction about individuals as friends or assets, and these
                    distinctions about individual Americans were, in the end, the most
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about thwe're showing an awful lot of concern, I
                        gather, about the Tudeh Party, being the Iranian Communist Party. How about
                        your time in Isfahan? Did this ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I knew all the Tudeh leaders that weren't in prison. The shah and SAVAK,
                    the secret police, trained by CIA and the Israelis, and connected to other
                    security organizations, had the Communist movemenmovements, which were several,
                    more or less under control. Yet, there were respected politicians who were
                    either present Tudeh, or lapsed Tudeh. In Iran there was debate at the highest
                    intellectual levels on the burning questions of social justice. They were
                    asking, “What's the best way to organize our society?” Even in Isfahan there was
                    extensive intellectual discussion about the strands or variants of communism.
                    There were the Chinese strands, Indian strands, there was the Soviet version,
                    and then there was an indigenous Iranian strand that came out of Gilan, near the
                    Caspian, where there was an uprising of Communists. The Communists tended to be
                    in the factories there, the new spinning mills and mechanical fabrication places
                    and where there were modern assembly lines. The new factories had networks that
                    could be organized in trade union kinds of social-political structures. Factory
                    based communist cells were most evident in Isfahan where there were thirty-two
                    spinning factories.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The cell structure of militant subversives was the main target of the secret
                    police. The trade unions were difficult to deal with because they were
                    transparent and acceptable to the public. Trade unions were expressing their
                    sense of social value legitimately. For the worker, Trade Unions were a form of
                    organization that brought them better wages and working conditions. I knew the
                    trade union leaders, many of whom were of tribal origin. They were tribal
                    leaders who could no longer lead tribes so they were leading unions. They were
                    people who understood the social problems of the workers many of whom were
                    tribesmen. This was so particularly with oil workers who were recruited from the
                    tribal regions where the oil fields were. As part of the intellectual firmament
                    about the organization of society, and among the intellectuals, the socialist
                    approach had a certain appeal for the Iranian intellectuals. The main issue
                    about the needed organizations of Iranian society was democracy versus the
                    thousands of years of royal rule by military force. How to bring democracy to
                    Iran was the core of the debate. How could the change to democracy be done?
                    Mossadeq, of course, was the hero, because he came out of traditional society,
                    who was definitely a bona fide nationalist who highly valued Iranian language,
                    culture, and had great respect for traditional Iranian social life, and
                    religions. He had championed a view of society in which the lowest in society
                    had a place, and was not simply a possession owned by someone else.</p>
                <p>Mossadeq and his followers expressed the democratic beliefs in formal terms, in
                    their party organizations that later came into play, as the National Front. They
                    also expressed their feelings in poetry, which was the most effective means for
                    Iranians of communication. It was amazing to me, a society in which poetry was
                    the most important way you could express political views as well as
                    emotions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Russian Intelligentsia. Not to the extent of the Persians. As much as
                    I loved the intellectual life I led in Moscow and in Ukraine, they are primitive
                    in some ways in comparison to the Iranians, certainly if you value the subtly of
                    their mind. The Iranian intellectuals do not have the ferocity of mind which the
                    Russians have in larger measure than anyone else, but for precision and subtlety
                    of thought, the Persians surpass all others.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, there were many. The first Iranian I met, I think I mentioned
                    earlier, was one of these. Hossein Mahdavy and I met at Oxford. We were together
                    for five years in Iran. Then we met again at Harvard, not long later in graduate
                    school. Many of the Iranians of my generation who were well educated were like
                    Hossein. My closest friends in Iran were people of similar background to that of
                    Hossein.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was normal, not unusual. The western educated intellectuals fit in to
                    the Iran of the 1960they were the heart. Even the shah's entourage was the same.
                    The “1,000 Families” sent all of their talented children to universities in the
                    West. The Bazaari class and their extended families and the leading religious
                    people sent their children to the West. Everyone who was affluent and able went
                    abroad. It was normal, it was like the great tour of Europe that the English
                    took in the 18th and 19th century. It was a finishing of their education. It
                    enabled them to understand how they fit into world civilization.</p>

                    to Greek training in Washington. However, the ambassador in Tehran, Julius
                    Holmes, asked that I stay to be his assistant. So I went up as a political
                    officer and as ambassador's aide.</p>

                <p>MILLER: This is a very typical foreign service staff. One of the people in my
                    class, A-100, was Allen Holmes. Julius Holmes was his father. I met Julius
                    Holmes on a number of occasions when we were in A-100 course. JuliuAmbassador
                    Holmes and his wife Henrietta had us to dinner a number of times to their home
                    in Washington. Allen and I were good friends and still are. Ambassador Holmes
                    had come to Isfahan a number of times and I had helped him with his official
                    trips. He had read my dispatches and liked them. He thought I could be useful. I
                    was very happy to stay. Suzanne and I were very delighted to stay. We were given
                    huge latitude by Ambassador Holmes. My beat, so to speak, was the opposition,
                    which meant my friends, really. I was allowed to continue to travel, even in my
                    new post in Tehran, to keep that pattern up, and given all kinds of freedoms.
                    For example, I found, a house near the embassy that I was allowed to rent. It
                    was a lovely house with a big compound two blocks from the embassy right in the
                    middle of Tehran. This 19th century compound had a water storage pool called a
                    hozh, which we made into a swimming pool. It also had a lovely orchard which
                    included persimmon trees with abundant delicious fruit that ripened at
                    Halloween. We used to carve the persimmons into pumpkin faces,
                    jack-o'-lanterns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife find the difference between Isfahan and
                        Tehran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We just continued our life that we had had there. Our first child was
                    born in Isfahan, Will was born in the Christian Mission hospital there. She had
                    many, many friends who were also the wives of my friends. She was never isolated
                    in the sense of being a foreigner. She had no difficulty taking Will in a
                    carriage down the Chaharbagh. The Iranian women would look in and say normal
                    things. She fitted in very well. In fact, we have a Persian friend from those
                    days visiting with us now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find working at an embassy, that the attitude or
                        something was different than working at a consulate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The scale of things in the embassy was much bigger. I had a wonderful
                    political counselor, a fellow named Harry Schwartz, who was a great help to me,
                    a good friend and mentor. Did you know him?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Harry Schwartz was a Princeton graduate. He married a Spanish woman of
                    great distinction, a lovely woman with lovely with red hair, who was from Jerez.
                    Her name was Maria Gonzales of the Gonzales sherry family. He was a saturnine,
                    grouchy, wonderful person who had very high standards of reporting. He detested
                    the DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission), they were constantly in battle.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Stuart W. Rockwell. They were very different in personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stuart Rockwell was very urbane. He's a Europeanist, I
                        would say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and a little aloof, but very able.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I mean when I say Europeanist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The political section, consisted of officermost of whom were Persian
                    language officers. They were interested in the country. Everyone had a lot of
                    work to do. There was a huge AID mission, a huge MAAG (Military Assistance
                    Advisory Group), there was an enormous CIA station with a spectacularly
                    flamboyant station chief, Gratian Yatsevich, who wore a monocle and carried a
                    sword cane. He was the closest most congenial American friend of the shah. He
                    would often be invited to be with the shah, much to Julius Holmes's anger.
                    Julius Holmes said, “Look, I'm number one in this place.” The shah had to resort
                    to subterfuge to meet with Yatsevich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were several countries that had the reputation in
                        the Foreign Service of being CIA counties. Iran was one. South Korean was
                        another.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: But Holmes being the consummate bureaucratic warrior that he was, he knew
                    this game. He made it very clear to Yatsevich that he was in charge, that he had
                    the authority, and that if Yatsevich crossed the line that had been drawn by
                    Holmes, he was out. Holmes could deliver on his word. Holmes was a real pro of
                    diplomatic life. He had had so many professional experiences that were
                    appropriate, and relevant to the problems we faced in Iran and he had always
                    wanted to go to Iran as ambassador. His appointment had been delayed in this
                    because of the war. After the war there were inquiries in Congress about his
                    shipping interests in the post-war period. As one of his assignments, he had
                    been chief of protocol, among other things, so everything was in the old style
                    and was done right. As ambassador's aide I was tutored not only by him but by
                    Mrs. Holmes, who made sure I understood how to set a table, that I put the right
                    people next to each other, and to be sure guests were well cared for. It didn't
                    hurt to have to do these things. And, of course, there were many funny
                    encounters along the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>Holmes liked to travel, but more comfortably than I was used to. He had a DC-3.
                    So he would fly all over the country. His children visited him, all of whom were
                    interesting. Allen came, and his sister, Elsie, who was an archeologist. These
                    trips were their first to Iran, and since we were all good friends we traveled
                    throughout Iran together. So it was a very happy situation. The residence was
                    still being furnished and landscaped. They allowed me to help them with getting
                    trees planted. We planted several thousand trees in the compound. We got them
                    out from the Ministry of Agriculture, through the aid program. As it turned out
                    these trees had grown to such a height and density of cover that they would have
                    prevented helicopters from coming in if that was attempted after the seizure of
                    the embassy and the taking of hostages in 1979.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Sacred! If a mayor planted trees, he was said to be a good mayor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: If there wasn't such a proverb they would have created it. It was
                    certainly apt. They did plant all the time. The water courses were all lined
                    with trees and gave pleasure and beauty in a very arid landscape.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there certainly was unease about that. It also created a great sense
                    of generosity on our side, we were at the height of our generosity, that is, the
                    amounts of aid and the benign character of it, I would say, even though it was
                    complicated by the support of the suppressive organizations like the secret
                    police, and the support of the shah without temperance, and the bringing Earl
                    Warren to speak on the rule of law to a group of judges and lawyers that was
                    doing the opposite.</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was is Sharia law or was it shah law in Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In Iran, it was shah's law. The Iranian legal system was a mixture of
                    Zoroastrian principles with Islamic and European additions. At that time, 1962,
                    the entire legal system under Reza Shah had been codified into a European
                    structure of law, although the code incorporated family law principles from the
                    Sharia. There were exceptions such as the movement in the direction of equal
                    rights for women. It was an evolving legal system, and the Justice Ministry,
                    judges were going on exchanges in Europe and the United States, and bringing
                    back ideas that were changing the nature of Iranian justice. Many of the law
                    makers, for example, from the National Front were educated in the West, and
                    helped pass laws that were more democratic in character. So the legal system was
                    alive, formally a mixture of Zoroastrian, Islamic and Western law, and evolving,
                    but it was clearly shah-dominated and not a rule of law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, say in foreign policI know from the Saudi
                        perspective when I was in Bahrain we covered the crucial state as well as
                        all the Gulf states except Kuwait. There was real concern about the shawell,
                        the Persians are moving in. They didn't like the name Persian they much
                        preferred it to be called Arabian Gulf. Was this an expansionisfrom the
                        Tehran point of view how did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The only issues that were faintly expansionisof course the Iranians
                    didn't regard them as expansionist, really, but they had no doubt about who
                    owned the disputed islands lesser tombs and larger tombs, which are only dots in
                    the Gulf. They basically scoffed the notion that the Persian Gulf could be
                    referred to the Arabian Gulf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Iran, in Bahrain, there was a feeling that this is very
                        typically Middle Eastern, that there was a plot to infiltrate all sorts of
                        Iranian workers so that eventually they would take over the island of
                        Bahrain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, certainly the oil workers throughout the Gulf were and are heavily
                    populated by Iranians. They knew how to do it, but no, there certainly there
                    wasn't a plot that I was aware of. It was just normal historical pressures of
                    peoples in an area where boundaries come together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were part of the political section, was there any
                        tension between the political section and the CIA station there on
                        reporting, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, constantly. This was a normal feature of the time in all significant
                    embassies. CIA had large stations, many of their officers were buried in the
                    political sections, and the distinction between assets and contacts wawhen it
                    became an issue, would be decided by the ambassador. I had many contacts that
                    they wanted to have as assets, and there were occasions when I went to Julius
                    Holmes and said, “You know, this absolutely crazy. They don't need to do this.”
                    He always supported me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there, just in the bureaucratic sensthere was
                        pressure on the CIA officers to sign up as many assets, whether it made any
                        real sense or not. I mean, they wanted to show that they were ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I don't think so, not in Iran, because, on the whole, they were very
                    good. The CIA had superb people that I have kept in touch with over the years
                    from that time, who I still see now, such as George Cave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just know the name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was their number one Iranian expert, and probably still is, even in
                    retirement. He was very sensible, spoke excellent Persian and in fact was a
                    Muslim. Yatsevich did the police jobs himself. He worked with the shah to the
                    extent Julius Holmes permitted it, and worked closely with the chief of the
                    secret police, Timur Bakhtiar, later Pakrahvan. Yatsevich had a circle of
                    friends at the shah's court. He was the designated person to do that. He liked
                    being at court anyway.</p>
                <p>In reflection, I look on Julius Holmes as a super-ambassador, almost a viceroy.
                    In this circumstance, and time he had that kind of power and influence, because
                    both Washington, and the shah understood that, was a viable style and Kennedy
                    made clear that Holmes had his personal support. Holmes knew Johnson, too,
                    pretty well and the shah and his entourage understood that reality.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Kennedy didn't come. Of course, he died in '63. No, he didn't come, but
                    Bobby did, and Justice Douglas, and a lot of the people from the NSBill Polk, I

                <p>MILLER: Bob Komer, with DOD (Department of Defense). So the key players in
                    Washington came frequently, and Johnson came, and I was one of the control
                    officers for Johnson's visit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, he wanted to go to visit the tribes. He went to the tribes. He had
                    a message from the shah, but his interest was Justice Douglas-driven. Douglas
                    had great admiration for the Bakhtiari when he visited. Bobby Kennedy was a hero
                    to many Iranian democratic nationalistparticularly whose who studied in
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Johnson, when he came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Johnson was spectacular. He came when he was vice president, after
                    visiting Pakistan where he was given a white camel, something he mentioned
                    several times with some irony, but he was definitely liked. He came with an
                    entouragLady Bird, Lynda Bird, a masseur Liz Carpenter and Bess Heel. It was a
                    big visit, a full plane load.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he arriveI remember that Harry Schwarz went to Istanbul to accompany
                    Johnson and his party. He didn't want any mistakes made. Every minute was
                    scripted, but Johnson did violence to any script. Johnson didn't like the air
                    conditioning in the palace so new air conditioners were put into the marble
                    palace where he was staying, and holes were drilled into ancient walls. He
                    wanted to go out and see the night life. His masseur had to be closer, in a
                    nearby room to work on him, I guess. Johnson was rather grumpy at first.</p>
                <p>And then he said, “Let's go outside of the city. I want to see the country.” So
                    we tumbled into a convoy owe were running along the desert at high speed and
                    then Johnson sees an excavation, one of a series of donut shaped holes in the
                    desert. He asked, “What are they?”</p>
                <p>I tell him, “These are the qanats, where the ancient water system flows
                    underground, sometimes 20 to 30 miles from the mountains. They first dig down
                    and clear a way a sloping channel through the earth. The channel is lined with
                    clay cylinders, baked clay cylinders, that reinforced the long, hand-dug tunnels
                    that are about the height of a man. This is an ancient agricultural practice.”
                    He was very interested in this. It seemed to him like West Texas, this arid
                    desert countrysidthis reminded him of his home. He said, “Let's get out and see
                    this.” So we get out of the cars and come up to a QanatMoqani, a worker cranking
                    a windlass coming up with a bucket full of loose earth and rocks from fifty feel
                    below.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Johnson said, “Is someone down there?” I said, “Yes there is someone digging a
                    water channel down there fifty feel below.” “Tell him the vice president of the
                    United States brings his greetings.” “Brings his greetings!” I say, “He maybe is
                    a little intimidated by this awesome presence.” The peasant at the windlass
                    blinks somewhat incomprehensively and then sends down the message from the vice
                    president. Silence. “Tell him again!” the vice president said. Still more
                    silence, then after a long pause a distant voice said uncertainly, “Long live
                    the shah!” Johnson laughed heartily at the answer as we all did.</p>
                <p>So he was that way. Impulsive, forceful, demanding. He was very interested in
                    Iran and in an intelligent way. He asked about Iran's politics and whether the
                    shah was loved by the people, did he have the people's supporthe key political
                    questions. Could the shah control the opposition?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When these questions came, how did you talk about the
                        opposition at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I was clear in expressing my views to Johnson about the political
                    situation. I thought the shah was losing his absolute control. I thought he had
                    lost his chance for legitimache never had gained legitimacy after '53. He was
                    ruling by force, not by popular will. I thought that the best people in the
                    country were the Nationalist Democrats, the followers of Mossadeq, and that
                    there was no way that the shah could sustain his absolutism. That was my view.
                    That was an argument in Washington as well at the time, and the policy
                    assumption was that the shah was the linchpin of stability. He said, “How can
                    this be, in the face of popular opposition and no reliable popular support?”
                    Johnson took it all in, asking intelligent questions at every point.</p>
                <p>The Shah had the levers of power, and therefore we should deal with him our
                    Washington policy makers said. The economic transformation of Iran, which the
                    plan organization was producing and there was no doubt Iran was being
                    transformed. Iran's economy was growing at a fantastic rate of growth and
                    infrastructure was being put in place, paid for by the oil revenues. The economy
                    was progressing mightily. The main policy view was that economic transformation
                    would lead eventually to political transformation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the take-off period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the take-off period, written about by Johnson's NSC advisor, former
                    MIT professor, Walt Rostow. Iran had reached the stage of take off already, and
                    in due course it would evolve, Rostow and others said. The contrary theorwell,
                    there were two opposing theories. One was, because of a ruling military, it will
                    always be a royal-military kingdom as it had been for thousands of years. The
                    second opposing view was the theory that I held, which was that the shah would
                    be removed if he didn't evolve with the democrats. They were the future.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I told Johnson that. I gave him the spectrum, and when he asked where I stood, I
                    said I thought that we should support the democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It shows an aspect of Johnson that often gets misplaced.
                        He gets forgotten, and that ione talks about his demands on all these trips,
                        but here is a man that is asking the right questions, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but one thing about him that I know, that I haven't seen later, over
                    the years, that I know from his Senate colleagues, and friends of many years who
                    worked for Johnson, was that it was hard to be certain that he'd be in a
                    listening mode. One friend who worked for Johnson said to me, he would listen to
                    you so that he would be able to dominate you, and you will do what he says.
                    Johnson already knows. He doesn't need to hear anything else.” In this case, I
                    think Johnson was listening. I suppose the reason was that his key staff had
                    told him that I was worth listening to, that I knew more than a little about
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there in '63 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: You mean in Tehran? '62 to '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major developments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh yes, many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let's talk about some.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The most important evenno, there were two importaneven pivotal -events.
                    Ali Amini was the Prime Minister. He was a clever, extremely able experienced
                    politician of Qajar origins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qajar being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MILLER: The previous dynasty that ruled Iran from the late 18th century until the
                    takeover by Reza Shah in 1921. Amini was very courtly and popular. He had been
                    an ambassador in the United States, had dealt with the oil nationalization
                    issues, was extremely bright, very funny, appealing to many, but he had been in
                    so many battles that he was distrusted by everyone to some degree. But he was
                    astute and thought that the young nationalists were the future, that we should
                    move in that direction. The shah, of course, distrusted them and him. The shah
                    made that clear to Julius Holmes, and the American government, that this issue
                    was an indication of whether the U.S. supported the shah or Amini. The Shah told
                    Ambassador Holmes that Amini had to go.</p>
                <p>The outcome of the control issue turned on a loan. This loan referred to 20
                    million dollars to finance a roll over of debt to the IMF, for a loan to handle
                    a difficult time in a transition budgetary process. We didn't support Amini's
                    request for a rollover loan, so he fell. From that point on, the shah was
                    absolute ruler. He would from that point on dictate all matters in the
                    Parliament, the budget. He ran the government, he chose the ministers, he
                    prescribed the elections, he made the election lists. Iran became an absolute
                    monarchy, and abandoned any thoughts of evolution towards a constitutional
                    monarchy, and it was a conscious decision on our government's part. It was a
                    battle that the policy makers in NSC and Defense Department lost, and of course
                    the people that held my point of view lost in Tehran. That was one issue. The
                    other was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave that, those supporting the refusal of the
                        loan and the American government, where were they coming from? What was the
                        feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they were known as “Shahparast”. It was a term that was used for
                    “shah-lovers.” The issue of support for the shah was partially resolved, by
                    extremely successful Iranian diplomacy, that is, they had ambassadors in
                    Washington who threw the biggest, elegant, lavish parties. They were civilized,
                    charming and able, well-connected in Washington circles and worked the
                    newspapers, the CIA, and the lobbyists very effectively. They worked hard and
                    well. The shah, himself and his wife Farah was very attractive too, many at that
                    time. In Washington they did the job of persuasion very well.</p>
                <p>The policy approached that were future oriented were viewed as too risky, too
                    speculative, and I suppose, the philosophy of a bird-in-the-hand is better than
                    two in the bush governed. The Shah seemed to have all of the trappings of power.
                    He commanded a modern military, he was buying new equipment, he would develop
                    the military using our technical assistance and the secret police, and he had
                    the army so he ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from the world's major exponent of democracy, was
                        there any sort of misgiving about supporting an absolute monarch?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MILLER: That was the debate, of course, at the time. For me, it was a major
                    disappointment. It seemed to me that our policy was not only a loser for the
                    long term, and certainly violated our own principles, and certainly violated the
                    view of George Kennan, that our strongest diplomatic weapon is to live as
                    democrats abroad, as we do at home, that we shouldn't have a schizophrenia of
                    purpose abroad. Iran's policy was a supreme example of that mistake. It was a
                    bitter experience for me to see this decision made. I was very disappointed in a
                    number of my colleagues who understood, but didn't want to take the risk by
                    speaking out. Holmes, I think, was one of them, really. He talked to me a number
                    of times about this when I brought it up with him. He said to me, “I don't see
                    the Shah losing now. Not in my time.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: However, he could have been right the other way, as well, depending on
                    the decision. To Holmes credit, he always heard me out and always insisted that
                    my views be known and reported. Ambassador Holmes supported me when I got into
                    direct difficulties with the shah. I saw the Shah, the queen and chief courtiers
                    on many occasions. I had a lot of contacts and friends in the court including
                    some of the sons of the Shah's sister. We often played tennis together. One of
                    them was a particularly odious type, for example, he used to sell antiquities
                    from the recent archaeological finds on the market, rather than putting them
                    into museums, a practice many Iranian friends found offensive.</p>
                <p>It came to the shah's attention that I was spending a lot of time with his
                    opponents. So he told Julius Holmes this, and Julius Holmes said, “Don't worry.
                    We need to know what is happening with the people who oppose you. It's good that
                    we know and, in fact, we will, of course, tell you what I understand was
                    happening. Don't worry. He's a young officer. He'll be all right.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned, you say there were two major things that
                        happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The other major event was Khomeini, the emergence of Khomeini.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MILLER: There were discussions at that time about reforms, some of which were put
                    into the five points of the White Revolutioland reform, emancipation, more
                    rights for women, and a number of other reforms that all were actually from the
                    program of the opposition National Front. In Qom, religious people were upset
                    about land reform, about immodesty of women, and changes in the law of
                    inheritance. Land reform affected the Waqf, the giving of bequests of land to
                    the religious establishments. The reforms were contrary to the normal laws of
                    inheritance. The National Front was opposed to land reform because they believed
                    that land distribution should be based on cadastral surveys; on first
                    determining what were viable pieces of land, and how could you create land
                    holdings large enough for individuals to survive under the new circumstances.
                    That was the Mossadeq point of view.</p>
                <p>In Qom a number of the clerics made speeches against one recent law that had been
                    forced through the majlis by the shah, which the United States wanted, which was
                    the so-called Status of Forces Agreement. The nationalists generally opposed
                    this law because it was understood to be a “concession”, an abridgement of
                    Iranian sovereignty, and the religious people took this sensitive nationalist
                    issue up as a cause along with the others. The shah, after hearing that sermons
                    had been given in the mosques and Qom, sent down paratroopers, and killed,
                    brutally, a number of the mullahs in the mosques, in one instance bashing their
                    brains out against the walls of the mosques. The paratrooper attack was an
                    atrocity. So a jihad (holy war) was declared. There was a march from Qom of the
                    religious, dressed in white shrouds. They really were profoundly affected on a
                    deeply felt jihad. No one expected this. The nationalists had no idea that this
                    issue would create such a huge popular uprising. Tens of thousands, came from
                    Qom, hundreds of thousands gathered when they came into Tehran, and in the end
                    many hundreds of thousands rioted.</p>
                <p>The shah sent the troops into battle, in American tanks of course, and killed
                    about six thousand people, six thousand on their approach to Tehran and then the
                    battle in Tehran itself. I was in the midst of some of these battles, observing,
                    and I was almost killed in one case, around the university.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean opposition in that these were armed people
                        shooting at soldiers or was this pretty much ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, they were unarmed. They had no weapons. They were being shot down.
                    They were just pressing forward in their frenzied lunatic way. Bullets were
                    firing everywhere, and the mob came very close to where I was standing and there
                    were bullets firing very close to me. So Khomeini emerges for the first time. I
                    reported this, at this time, about this unknown clerical leader. Khomeini was
                    taken prisoner and sentenced into exile. The importance of the uprising was that
                    in the absence of anything else, that is the nationalist opposition, the
                    religious people had this force to bring the populace into the streets. This
                    astounded the nationalists, astounded the shah. We were somewhat shocked by it
                    at first and then it slipped out of our political consciousness as other events
                    took precedence, as they exiled people and cleaned out, they thought, the
                    religious opposition. I can remember at the time, my good friend Hussein Mahdavy
                    telling me that this was a new force, that we all have to take account of
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think the uprising was so sudden and so violent that it seemed to the
                    military that criminal elements were in the street. I know that the scale of the
                    disorder was terrifying. It was premature to connect the uprising with solely
                    the religious leaders of the country. There were divided views about everything,
                    and religious leaders were way down on the list of significant opposition to the
                    Shah. Religious leaders were not at the top of the agenda; they were near the
                    last. The clergy was the last structural organization in the political system.
                    There were many viable secular structures in between. First were the democratic
                    nationalists than there were Communists, after the Communists the religious
                    structures were of least importance, at that time, 1963.</p>

                    from the bazaar. They were after the shah. The bazaars, they would never touch
                    them, because that's where they come from. The bazaar and the religious people
                    were and are almost an identity.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: They thought this was a phenomenon that they had never believed could
                    happeit happened. They began to take account of it. They had religious people
                    involved in their nationalist politics — they always had religious people among
                    their ranks. This was religious extremism that arose as a result of an extremist
                    action on the part of the shah. That was the new equation, that nationalist drew
                    up at the time. At the time, the National Front couldn't do anything about it.
                    They didn't take charge of it. They had to step aside. The uprising was
                    understood as a signal that in the absence of institutions in-between, the
                    religious structure would be there unless they too were destroyed. The shah's
                    thinking was he could take care of the religious unrest. He would wipe them out.
                    What stands in the way, is the growing international and internal power of human
                    rights, which if applied, would limit the ability of the Shah to exterminate the
                    group. The transparency of the society, the growth of a free press and more open
                    comment, education, travel, the desire to have the respect of the West, a
                    longing to be regarded as a positive world force in the circles of international
                    power, particularly at the enthronement of the monarchy, the celebration of 3000
                    years of monarchy in Persepolis in 1974.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that was at the core of the policy and the intellectual debate. On
                    the desk, at the Middle East bureawere real policy pros, and they understood
                    what was happening. Kay Bracken was the desk officer, John Bowling and John
                    Stutesman were in the NEA Bureau as were David Newsome and Richard Parker. I'd
                    say the issue of the shah versus democratic opposition was a permissible debate
                    within the Department. In the Kennedy years, and into Johnson, the NSC was more
                    important than State covering Iran, but not elsewhere, because of the quality of
                    the Arabists and their domination of the policy debate. Iran policy was an issue
                    in the White House. It was also an issue in Congress. Iran policy was a big
                    issue in the lobbying community. The Iran lobbies had a very powerful impact in
                    Washington. After the Israelis, I suppose, the Iranians at that time were the
                    most active, and spent the most, and got the most out of it. Policy debates
                    about Iran among the academics, was very lively. Certainly the opposition point
                    of view was very strongly held in universities where the students were almost
                    without exception part of the democratic nationalist opposition.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Repeatedly, as the end came near. The Iranian students were of course
                    engaged in their own politics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the dominant figures in this Iranian

                <p>MILLER: At that time?</p>

                <p>MILLER: There was Walt Rostow and the superb Middle East scholar, Bill Polk, who
                    were the most important, and Bob Komer in the Defense Department, called by his
                    allies, a very brilliant bureaucrat but called by his enemies “the Hammer.”</p>

                <p>MILLER: Polk is in retirement in south of France at Mougins. He has a lovely

                <p>MILLER: There were other people, in the universities that were importanCuyler
                    Young at Princeton. People like Herman Eilts, and Richard Parker. Nikki Keddie
                    was very good on Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling for NEA (Bureau for Near Eastern
                        Affairs)? Were they, as so often happened, so enmeshed in the Israeli cause,
                        one way or another that this wayou were sort of a sideline?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, at that point Iran was a major issue. It was also White House issue.
                    Therefore, it was a major policy issue for the whole government. It was also a
                    Hill issue, therefore it was a major policy issue of national importance. The
                    shah, of course, had good relations at that point with Israel. The Israelis had
                    an agricultural mission of sizable proportions. They were also giving technical
                    assistance and training to the SAVAK secret police, on communications,
                    techniques, and sharing intelligence on the Arabs, and on the Soviets. The
                    Soviet factor was important at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Soviet factor important in that it was always a
                        concern that it might extend its influence, and so you had to ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There were several reasons. Yes, one was the possibility that the Soviets
                    would extend its influence agaian influence that receded after the 1953 coup and
                    the removal of, in our minds, of Communist political structures from Iran. The
                    Soviet factor was the reason for the need for bases, listening posts for
                    watching missile launches up along the northern boarder, particularly at sites
                    close to Turkmenistan, on both sides of the Caspian, east and west and even
                    south. These bases were very important to us from the point of view of watching
                    Soviet missile activities.</p>
                <p>The strategic missile, nuclear aspect of our Soviet policy was very important at
                    that time. I should mention that. There was a bill passed in the Parliament in
                    1964 which forbade the placement of foreign missiles on Iranian soil which our
                    government did not like. I remember going to see the shah with Julius Holmes on
                    this question. It was a very sensitive discussion, but it was a practical
                    matter. From a strategic point of view, we didn't need the emplacement of
                    missiles in Iran, particularly after Cuba. The removal of Jupiter missiles from
                    Turkey made very clear that we were now in the age of long range missiles,
                    ICBMs, submarines, and bombers even though coverage of the Soviet Union from
                    Iran could be done, with shorter range missiles. That was one aspect. The Soviet
                    question was always a major concern for American policy. The shah used this
                    American policy imperative very successfully to his advantage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the issue of corruption during the time you

                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MILLER: That was always an issue. It was always an issue, but it was understood
                    in Washington as a normal feature of governments in that part of the world and
                    not treated with more than mild regret, as long as it didn't interfere with
                    major U.S. business interests or government policy, which it didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the shah, particularly the shah's family
                        and the court, was getting greedier and greedier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the family was. I did considerable reporting on that, and others in
                    the embassy did as well. Corruption and greed and the odiousness of the royal
                    family and the court were frequently reported subjects. Corruption didn't seem
                    to matter as long as the shah supported us. I suppose by comparison to the other
                    states in the region, Turkey, Iraq and the Gulf states, Iran did look like the
                    most stable state in the region. It is still the most stable state in the region
                    even if we are not friends at the present.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, one of the great proponents was Richard Helms. Helms was a very
                    strong supporter of the shah and he influenced many key congressmen and senators
                    about Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of CIA at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Helms, the head of CIA, was a school mate, actually, of the shah's in
                    Switzerland as a boy, at Le Rosey. They went to the same school. They had grown
                    up in a similar world and had a shared view of Europe. They shared the same
                    anti-Soviet perspective and had some sense of solidarity that came from that
                    shared understanding. The CIA welcomed the operational convenience that the shah
                    offered. A lot of the influence Iran had in Congress came from that arrangement.
                    Iran had a very positive image that was conveyed to them by the top CIA
                    officials. Of course, Kim Roosevelt had carried out the coup which was then
                    viewed as a great success of policy. Congress had many who believed in the
                    utility of the covert actions of that time. Senators like Stuart Symington and
                    John Stennis, and Richard Russell were great supporters of the shah.</p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, Stuart Symington was from Missouri. He was a Truman democrat and was
                    once head of Emerson Electric in St. Louis, and was the Secretary of the Air
                    Force. Symington was one of the key people in Congress on defense and foreign
                    policy matters. Senator Fulbright was an anomaly. He listened to the Iranian
                    students and believed they were right. The majority in Congress, however, saw
                    the shah as an ally in the Cold War. The Cold War was the test of loyalty to the
                    United States. The Iranians had good relations with India and Pakistan, and
                    relatively speaking, fell on the right side of the Cold War equation.
                    Increasingly, as the Iranian students demonstrations had their presence felt,
                    there was some change in attitude in Congress, the dominant view was determined
                    by the Cold War equation. The nationalist aspirations and the democratic
                    movements were secondary to that first concern, right up to the end, right up
                    until the revolution, which took place in 1979, well before the period of
                    perestroika between 1985 and 199the Gorbachev erand before the formal end of the
                    Cold War.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The first assignment that I had in Washington was in INR (Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research), to write a political dynamics paper on Iran. That
                    was a six-month project. Then I was assigned to the Peace Corps. That was the
                    time when the State Department was encouraging assignments for junior officers
                    in other agencies. I was head of Middle East programs for the Peace Corps for
                    six months or so. That was followed by assignment to the Secretary of State's

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>MILLER: Assignments were being made from the Department of State to other
                    agencies, in order to give familiarity to junior Foreign Service officers to
                    some other parts of the government that were involved in foreign affairs. The
                    Peace Corps being a favorite of the Kennedy administration, it was very vigorous
                    and had considerable funding and political support within the White House and in
                    Congress. It was well funded, and as an idea for creative foreign policy, had
                    great currencthat is, the idealistic youth of working with counterparts in
                    countries less fortunate would build lasting bonds through mutual efforts of
                    improving the lot of those countries.</p>
                <p>When I was in Iran, the Peace Corps had put in place a very large program. It was
                    a good one. It worked in the villages, on education, health and water supply.
                    The Peace Corps had a very big group that worked on teaching in the villages.
                    Literacy corps activity, by the Iranians and other village work by the Peace
                    Corps made it possible to extend education to villages where it was not possible
                    before. It should be noted that in almost all villages of Iran no matter how
                    remote, there was a mullah. He would teach at the village schoocalled maktabfor
                    three grades. They taught the Koran, the great Persian poets, and used whatever
                    literary materials were available. The idea of village education was something
                    that was built into the Iranian system. What the modern world brought, with the
                    shah's so-called literacy corps and programs like the American Peace Corps,
                    accompanying that, which were much smaller in number of course compared to the
                    tens of thousands of teaching mullahs, was a new dimension. The literacy corps
                    and the Peace Corps teachers extended and modernized, meaning secularized, what
                    had been a traditional form of basic literacy that had a strong religious
                    content. As I think about it now, the roots of religious life throughout the
                    country really was reflected in the role of the mullah in the village. The
                    mullah performed marriages. He taught. He buried the dead. The mullahs were a
                    key part of the social structure of villages and cities that had existed for a
                    very long time. I suppose if one did careful research you could go back before
                    Islam and you would have found that Zoroastrian priests carried out these
                    necessary social functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under the shah's regime, were they able to tap a resource
                        to bring about further education of having young, educated Iranians going
                        out to the people, sort of like Narodniki? I mean, of that type?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, that was the way the literacy corps performed. That was
                    characteristic of the most successful programs. The literacy corps was a program
                    whereby young Iranian university graduates, and high school graduates, went out
                    to the villages and taught. In other words, those who were going into education
                    as a profession in the Ministry of Educatiothat was the sole employer of
                    teachers, and a handful of very few private schoolthey went out into the
                    villages as part of their training. Just as our doctors here under the medical
                    student support programs the Congress has mandated, are given free education for
                    medical training, then the doctors were obligated to serve for several years in
                    public health. So the Iranian student teachers went out to the villages as
                    secular, modernizing missionaries.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Most of the teachers were urban, from the big cities. They had never really
                    experienced or seen real life in the villages. They became socialized when they
                    saw, at first hand, realities of Iran. Many of the literacy corps became
                    revolutionaries later. They saw the needs of the country first hand. It was part
                    of the process of what we could call, Iran's democratization. The country was
                    meeting itself on its own terms and seeing what its needs were and responding.
                    The literacy corps, the medical corps, those infrastructure kinds of approaches
                    that were in the so-called White Revolution but were also planned for in the
                    Plan Organization objectives of the time of what was needed for Iran to become a
                    modern state. One could see some of the roots of revolution, the revolution of
                    '79, in the experience those people who went to the villages in the 60's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to your time. You were with the Peace Corps from when
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was after I came back so I would say it was six months really.
                    1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sixty-five. What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was in charge of Middle East Programs in the Peace Corps down the
                    street from here at the Wilson Center. What that job involved was being like a
                    bureau chief in the State Department for the Peace Corps, handling the reporting
                    in and out and visiting the programs in the field and seeing to the budgets and
                    working on personnel assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our programs in the Middle East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: They were varied, but they were largely in education. Teaching of English
                    was the main program. It was very hard to train people to a level high enough so
                    that they could teach in the language of the country, although there was a
                    commendable emphasis on language training. The Peace Corps was very good for our
                    youth, extremely important. In the case in Iran, they did have six months of
                    Persian language training. Many Peace Corps volunteers later went into the State
                    Department. There were, also, a group of doctors sent throughout the Middle
                    East; there were architects sent to some places like Morocco. There were even
                    small business programs. Jimmy Carter's mother, for example, was a retired
                    business person and went out as a Peace Corps volunteer.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Generally, Peace Corps volunteers were working in the villages in some useful
                    way, whether it was trying to deal with cleaning up polluted water, bringing
                    needed medical supplies, or adequate toilets and basic sanitation. Most
                    important, I'd say our best result from our Peace Corps experience was the
                    knowledge that it brought, to young Americans, of the outside world. That was
                    the greatest impact. It had as much impact on us, as the Peace Corps had on
                    other nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this for only about six months, and then
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Then I came back to State. The INR assignment was before the Peace Corps.
                    Then I came back to State, and went to SS (Secretary of State) as a line officer
                    for the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in INR for how long, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you dealing with in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Tom Hughes, who was then the head of INR, asked me to do a political,
                    dynamic study of Iran. That was a form of art at that time, which, as the name
                    implies, is an analysis of how politics works in Iran. Who's who? How do they
                    behave? What are their views, what's their attitude to the United States, what
                    are the long term prospects? The Political Dynamics paper was a useful summary
                    of what Iranian politics was. Certainly the paper made use of what I knew,
                    making use of what I was engaged in, for five years in Iran. This was a
                    marvelous Tom Hughes invention.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The length of the paper was about 75 to 80 pages. The Political Dynamics paper
                    followed a fairly sensible format. It waI've reread this document recently, was
                    a useful comprehensive way of looking at politics in Iran. There was the
                    day-to-day coverage of intelligence concerning Iran, the Middle East, and
                    conferences, the interagency contacts that one has and in Washington. The
                    Political Dynamics paper was a way for a junior officer coming into the
                    Washington policymaking world, and INR, at that time, to do something useful.
                    INR was a good place for a junior officer to be because of Hughes. Tom Hughes
                    was very well wired to the White Houseven the Johnson White House, certainly
                    with the Kennedy White HousINR product was used, valued, and there were very
                    good people in INR at the time. One could expect phone calls from the White
                    House. The NSC staff called frequently. The major people who were interested in
                    foreign affairs would call about Iran. It was a place regarded at that time as a
                    useful resource. I found it extremely good posting, and there were very few
                    bureaucratic restrictions. INR put the highest value on intellectual rigor. INR
                    product was used which is not always the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you finINR, at that time, in your field, Iran,
                        worked with the CIA? Did they have different views, the same views, or
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I don't think there was very much difference between the
                    interrelationships that one has now, in that period. The reason is that in the
                    field in Iran itself, even in the consulate like Isfahan, when you have a spook
                    there, and of course, a very large station in Tehran, you have to work together.
                    We knew each other well. It was a carefully integrated disciplined embassy. This
                    is partially due to Julius Holmes's discipline. Many of the CIA people I knew
                    then I still see from time to time now. I value them very highly. One of the
                    interesting things that I learned at that point was what they could do better
                    than we could do as State diplomats, and what we could do that they
                    couldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they could buy people. They could place agents, recruit agents in
                    the world that we would not frequent normally, that is, the underworld. They
                    were dealing very often with traitors. They were dealing with criminals because
                    they had information and were in position not only to know, but to do. Of
                    course, the legacy of the overthrow of 1953, in the Iran case, was very strong,
                    and they had a very close liaison with the local intelligence service, which
                    diplomats probably would not have. I would say that where the difficulties arose
                    was in the normal world of diplomacy. Officials, who should be working with the
                    diplomats, were often curried by the spooks. They shouldn't have done that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was pressure to get agents. Every scalp that you got
                        you credit, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MILLER: There is a very interesting case in point that comes to mind now. In
                    Isfahan there were several leaders of the National Front, which was the
                    democratic descendant of the Mossadeq National Front. Western educated, highly
                    educated, under any standards, well-to-do, bourgeois democrats. Two of the
                    leaders in Isfahan were good friends of ours. The reasons were our first two
                    children were born in Iran. Our Iranian friends had children at the same time.
                    We'd play tennis together. We liked each other, saw a lot of each other.</p>
                <p>The National Front was a target of the agency. They wanted to know about it. The
                    National Front avoided any Communist ties. I had a clash on this matter because
                    these were my friends and the spooks were saying get out of the way. I said,
                    “No, not at all. That's not your turf.” That's one issue I took to Julius
                    Holmes, and he sorted that one out. These kinds of problems arose on occasion in
                    Tehran too. We had those kinds of disputes. It is very important, it seems to
                    me, for Foreign Service people, even if you are junior and have no power or
                    rank, to make it clear what you think the legitimate grounds are, and to
                    understand what they are, to begin with. Then you can have a good working
                    relationship with CIA on the basis of what people could do best.</p>
                <p>In the interagency arrangements, at the highest levels, it is like many other
                    things. If you are part of the group that goes to the same dinners and parties,
                    it's useful in the long run. I happen to have known Richard Helms because he was
                    a Williams man. I've known him since I was at Williams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What class was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: 1935.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 15 years before my time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and because of that, he would invite us to dinners and dancing
                    parties, for example, at the Chevy Chase Country Club and the Women's Sulgrave
                    Club. He was part of the circle of Washington people often invited to the White
                    House. The reason I mention this is that the social relationships, the
                    friendships you make in the field, if they are also a part of what you do in
                    Washington, give you greater depth, dimension and influence. INR, which is seen
                    by many now as a dead end for the career, was certainly not regarded as that,
                    perhaps because its OSS beginnings were still part of the aura of policy making
                    in Washington. The first INR Directors had influence because they were part of
                    the policy making cadres that carried on after World War II the analysts from
                    INR, as a consequence were very influential, even the long-term civil servants,
                    many of whom came directly to the State Department from OSS. The Soviet analysts
                    and the Middle East experts, were highly valued. They really had a superb group
                    of experienced, brilliant analysts, even though their filing systems were often
                    of the shoebox variety.</p>

                <p>MILLER: People like Hal Sonnenfeldt and Baraz were writing excellent analyses of
                    the Soviet Union. There were some really astonishing intellects of the kind that
                    reflect the closest parallels, in the outside world, to the world of Smiley and

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and the woman in charge of shoebox memory that Smiley went to,
                    saying “What do you know of Karla ...?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeinat that time you were looking at Iran, did
                        you see this is well, 15 years before the overthrow of the shah, but did you
                        see a stable, destabled, troubling situation there, when you were looking at
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I said there's a coming revolution, and I even titled some
                    dispatches, “The Coming Revolution.” An Iranian friend of mine, who I still am
                    very close to, Hossein Mahdavy, who I had met at Oxford when I was a student,
                    wrote an article for Foreign Affairs, which I helped get into Foreign Affairs,
                    called “The Coming Revolution in Iran.” He laid out the difficulties of
                    democratic groups under the shah and the pressure that difficulty was creating
                    in society, and laid out with remarkable accuracy what eventually happened.</p>
                <p>My view, based on my direct experience in Iran was that the shah was imposed,
                    that he was not popular, that the vast majority of Iranians wanted more
                    openness, and a share of governance. The Shah would be removed if he didn't
                    respond to the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across in this as you werat your level, but
                        right above you, was there an almost entrenched Iranian club that felt the
                        shah would go on forever?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there was. There was the shah's “linchpin of the stability group.”
                    That was the phrase that was used in Iran policy documents. Their argument was,
                    this is a traditional monarchical society and had been for thousands of years.
                    This is the way it has been and the majority of the Iranian people are used to
                    it. The democratic idea is a western idea. It wouldn't work in Iran. Further, we
                    have good relations with this shah. He does what we want. We put him there. He's
                    our man.</p>
                <p>That was the policy when I arrived. That was the policy through the Kennedy
                    administration, through the Johnson administration, although it was contested
                    all the way through in the White House, not in State, not in the CIA. Yes, in
                    the Pentagon there were some individuals who pushed a reopening up such as Bob
                    Komer.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with Bill Miller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: “The blowtorch”, Bob Komer, who was very close to Lyndon Johnson, and of
                    course was deeply involved in Vietnam policy, he and Bill Polk, in the White
                    House, who was a good friend of the Kennedys, were raising questions of
                    political stability constantly, based on the Iranian student demonstrations that
                    were increasing in number and size even to the extent of picketing the White
                    House and Congress. The issue was, can the shah withstand unpopularity? Were
                    there alternatives to the shah? So the issues were raised. Komer and Polk, came
                    out, I can vividly remember on one occasion, to Iran on a U.S. military aircraft
                    and annoyed the hell out of Ambassador Holmes because they were very preemptory
                    and imperial in their manners and demanded to see the Shah and all the key
                    figures in the government. They were very short on courtesies.</p>
                <p>So they went throughout Iran, saw everyone they could, and wrote a report saying
                    that the shah was unpopular, and was holding on to an increasingly weakening
                    power base. But in the end, despite this awareness of unpopularity, on all of
                    the critical points, the decision was made to support the shah in the face of
                    the opposition, even democratic opposition. The crucial point, that tipped the
                    balance as I mentioned earlier, was a decision covering roll-over funding for
                    Prime Minister Ali Amini, an IMF rescheduling of debt payment. But the real
                    issue was support for the shah or Parliamentary governments. Yes, there was a
                    dispute in Washington, but the majority view was that the shah's regime was
                    well-financed, he had the military, and would prevail. The contrary view was
                    that he didn't have the military, except at the top. The younger ones were
                    trained in the United States, just like the students. They would take hold of
                    different viewand we knew their views, because we knew them in the field.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're sort of jumping back and forth, but you went to the
                        line of the Secretary owhen did you go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was immediately after the Peace Corpthat was in 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were doing that for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: About a year or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So sort of '66, '67. What sort of things were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The “Line” at that point was organized to give substantive and
                    administrative support to the secretary. The Executive Secretary, at that time,
                    was Ben Read, a fine man, very astute, very well connected to the White House.
                    Read was a lawyer and had come to the State Department from the Hill. He was
                    Senator Joe Clark's legislative assistant and like Senator Clark, was from
                    Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>The organization of the Executive Secretariat was fairly straightforward. It was
                    organized into bureaus, a line officer for each bureau or two bureaus, as in my
                    case. I had Middle East and Southeast Asia. There were several people working on
                    Southeast Asia. Our duties were to read all of the incoming material in those
                    areas, all of it, the complete coverage on a daily basis, all press, and all the
                    outgoing cables. We had to edit the outgoing for the Secretary's signature. So
                    anything that would go to the secretary or the undersecretary would go through
                    SS for clearance. What “clearance” meant was vetting all written material.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that, given the time you were doing this,
                        that you would have been swamped by the “era of reframing” thing. The '67
                        war came around at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Of course, yes, there were a lot of things going oVietnam, the '67 War,
                    the extreme pressures from the Soviet Union on Europe. Then '68 comes along with
                    the Prague uprising in Czechoslovakia. So yes, it was a heady time, very active.
                    Dean Rusk, who was the Secretary of State, was a very vigorous, active
                    secretary, with very decided views and great experience. His views on Vietnam,
                    of course, were very doctrinaire, and, I would say, very contrary to the views
                    of most of his associates, certainly to those of George Ball his deputy and I'd
                    say the junior officers as a whole, even in the pertinent bureaus. But we were
                    loyal to him, and he treated his staff very, very well. We all had great respect
                    and admiration for Dean Rusk despite our belief that he was dead wrong on
                    Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I went to Vietnam, and the Middle East, for a number of long trips
                    with the secretary. My function was to give staff supporat the minimum,
                    physically carrying the bags, at the maximum, writing the speeches that the
                    secretary was giving at the various places we were visiting, and handling the
                    same duties in an airplane or in a hotel or the headquarters that we were doing
                    in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How diyou were with your colleagues, and I realize that
                        you were both loyal to the secretary and also, you didn't have much time for
                        anything but to do your job, but what was, sort of, your feeling and the
                        feeling of others when you had a chance to talk to each other about Vietnam
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We had a lot of time to talk, and to be exposed to it, because the
                    working conditions of SS then, and I'm sure something like it now, was a poop
                    deck on a man-o-war. Little stalls, crammed close to each other, a lot of noise,
                    and constant pressure of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the question of authority here at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. SS was a very lively cockpit of ideas, and we had the best
                    information, available because we'd get the full materials and evidence prepared
                    for the briefings for the secretary every night. Each night he would look at the
                    reports of the bombing runs, of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, how many dead, how many
                    bombs dropped, how many airplanes, etc. We would see all of this informatiothe
                    same data going to the Secretary. We knew exactly what the secretary was
                    getting, and had a hand in preparing the material he was using, so we knew the
                    official reality. This document and reality, was reinforced by seeing the war on
                    the ground during trips to Saigon and elsewhere, in Asia. We knew the views of
                    our own highest officials like Ball and Bundy, and Hubert Humphrey and so many
                    people; McNamara, of course, and the others who were going out to Vietnam
                    repeatedly. So, we knew the reality, and the reality was far from what our
                    leaders hoped it would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the equivalent to almost a dissent channel, or
                        was there anything of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes. There was a lot of dissent channeled. There was easy and direct
                    access to, in the case of Vietnam, to be able to talk to George Ball about
                    Vietnam. I talked often to Ben Read about the contradictions between evidence
                    and policy. I had good conversations with both Bill Bundy and Mac Bundy. There
                    was an internal debate. There was no constraint about thinking or talking
                    privately about Vietnam policy. There was, however, the expectation of support
                    for those who were carrying out policy. I did so until it became, in my case,
                    intolerable, and I left, but that was after I had gone from SS to another
                    assignment. President Johnson created by Executive Order a coordinating
                    committee under George Ball. Lyndon Johnson fully supported the SIG (Senior
                    Interagency Group) idea that all foreign policy issues at the deputy secretary
                    level to be cleared and coordinated by State. It was the last time the State
                    Department was in charge of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>Now, the case, of course, is that all the foreign policy and defense committees
                    are chaired by the White House, and that's been the case since Kissinger, but
                    under Dean Rusk and, particularly, George Ball, the under secretaries committee
                    handled all the foreign policy except for those things that were being directly
                    and personally addressed by President Johnson himself or by Secretary Dean
                    Rusk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with this committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was the staff. The executive secretary, Harry Schwartz, had been my
                    political counselor in Tehran. I thought he was a terrific guy, a wonderful,
                    curmudgeonly character, very smart. He had served in several White Houses as the
                    State Department representative on the NSC, so he knew the NSC structure, all of
                    the NSC lower had history. He was a highly sophisticated, very complicated, man
                    married to a lovely Spanish woman from Jersey. Marishe had red hair, an English
                    background. They were a nice familwe were very good friends. Harry Schwartz gave
                    me free rein in Tehran, actually. He said, “Go for it, you more than anybody
                    else, keep going.” When the SIG was created, he asked me to come as his
                    assistant, special assistant. That was the staff, Harry Schwartz and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from what, '67 to ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Sixty-seven, I worked flat out for about six months and then I resigned.
                    Part of the reason for my resignation was that the SIG in the end failed,
                    because the secretary didn't support it when asked to by George Ball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was thDean Rusthe basic issue was Vietnam, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Dean Rusk was bound and determined to put everything
                        into Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He ignored the rest, yes, basically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the undersecretarwere you sort of there
                        as the note-taker and all? Were they trying to take it at a different tack?
                        George Ball was well-known for being in opposition, loyal opposition, but
                        how about the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: This was the fundamental turf issue affecting all foreign policy. The
                    turf battle that was fought over Vietnam affected all of the other aspects of
                    foreign policy. This interagency grouit was called the SIG, (Senior
                    Interdepartmental Group, S-I-G). The turf battle on all other foreign policy
                    issues than Vietnam was allowed to go on without structural discipline. The
                    Pentagon would handle everything it thought was their concern. Obviously, many
                    issues were of interest to at least two or more departments or agencies. There
                    was a constant battle going on on Vietnam, and the secretary was too busy to
                    support Ball. Although the SIG was a fully empowered by Johnson, the burden of
                    Vietnam prevented it from being a coordinating body. The SIG did not change the
                    landscape.</p>
                <p>I had been becoming increasingly despondent and pessimistic about the direction
                    of Vietnam. In the last trip that I took to Vietnam, with the secretary, that
                    included a number of people from outside of the department, including several
                    senators, one of whom was Senator John Sherman Cooper ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Kentucky senator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Senator Cooper asked me to consider joining his staff to work on
                    Vietnam, and I thought about this and decided that, in all conscience, I
                    couldn't go on within the State Department, being so close to Vietnam policy
                    itself. Even though, I had no policy role, I thought that I really had to do
                    what I could to help to bring the war to an end.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>So I resigned, very regretfully, because I loved the Foreign Service, and I had a
                    wonderful, wonderful career to that point, and I had every reason to believe my
                    career would prosper. Although I could see that each rising appointment would
                    have less and less adventure and direct experience of the kind I had in Iran and
                    on the “line” in Sless tangibility, it would become more and more bureaucratic,
                    and that the odds of having such hands on assignments as I had had would be
                    small, just in the nature of things. I was very torn, but I decided that working
                    on the Hill, with a fine person like Senator John Cooper, on bringing the
                    Vietnam war to an end was what I should do. So I resigned and went to the Hill.
                    The very first day at work in the Senate, May 15, 1967, I wrote a speech on the
                    necessity of stopping the bombing of Vietnam, which was delivered that
                    afternoon. It was a very satisfactory beginning.</p>

                <p>MILLER: He was the ambassador to India.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador to India, yes, but what about John Sherman
                        Cooper at that time. Where was he, what was his background? What party was

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: John Sherman Cooper was a Republican from Somerset, the county seat of
                    Pulaski County, which is in southern central Kentucky. Cooper's family had been
                    there since the frontier days. Cooper was a handsome, tall, courtly gentle soul
                    who, in spite of being a Republican in a Democratic state, won handily because
                    of his appealing charm and experience. He started as a student at Center
                    College, where he was a great football player, in those days. He went from there
                    to Yale as a football player. Then to Harvard Law School, and became a county
                    judge. The position of county judges in those days in Kentucky was a first step
                    to a political career.</p>
                <p>Then World War II came, and he went into the army, even though he was overage, at
                    45. He was given the rank of captain and went to Germany and fought there until
                    the end of the war. After the war Cooper was one of the governors, military
                    governors for occupied Germany. Cooper worked closely with General Lucius Clay
                    and James Conant in the immediate administration of Germany, after the war. He
                    came back to Kentucky and was a prime candidate for election to office. Cooper
                    was elected to the Senate in a by-election when Barkley left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alben Barkley was the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He became the vice president for Truman, and so Cooper was the senator
                    from that election. He was then defeated. Cooper was a close friend of Dean
                    Acheson and Cooper then worked with Acheson at the UN and at NATO (North
                    Atlantic Treaty Organization). President Eisenhower then appointed Cooper
                    ambassador to India. Cooper then ran for election again at the end of his term
                    in India, where he served with great distinction, and was a great friend of
                    Prime Minister Nehru.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nehru.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Nehru, a great Prime Minister, the Indian that caused us so much trouble
                    because their non-aligned position. Cooper also got along well with the Foreign
                    Minister, Krishna Menon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Krishna Menon. Many of the Foreign Service consider him to
                        be the black menace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, Cooper got along with him very well perhaps because Cooper's manner
                    was such that his genuine interest in getting to know and understand difficult
                    characters, like Menon and Nehru. Cooper was a big figure in the Senate from
                    that time, although he was unusual in Democratic Kentucky as a Republican, and
                    unusual as a Republican in the Senate, because he behaved more like a Democrat
                    than a Republican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also an internationalist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was an internationalist and totally independent. No one could tell him
                    what to do, claiming party discipline. If anyone attempted to, he would probably
                    vote the other way or simply turn on his heel and walk away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the staff when you entered in '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Of the Senate?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Both of Coopeand then, was he on the Foreign Relations
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that was the whole point of my going to work as his foreign policy
                    assistant, that he was on the Foreign Relations Committee and I was his staff
                    person for foreign policy and defense. He was very interested in arms control as
                    well.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The staff was wonderful. The Senator's staff director's name was Bailey Guard, a
                    Kentuckian who handled agriculture and interior matters. Bailey Guard was a
                    great friend and we remained good friends until he died a few years ago. He was
                    a lovely human being. Cooper had a very happy staff. There were young students
                    from Kentucky there as interns. Recent college graduates would come as
                    secretaries for several years. They were bright and cheery and happy. He had a
                    wonderful staff totally devoted to him. It was a very small office because
                    Senator Cooper was very austere in his behavior. He had a fierce guardian
                    secretary, Martha, who was extraordinarily protectiveven possessive. The great
                    art was to get through her or around her, but that was easily done. In the end,
                    as we knew each other better, trust between us developed and Martha and I became
                    very good friendthe Senate was a very good place to work, staffs of the senators
                    worked very closely with the staffs of their senate offices and their
                    committees. The Senate was a wonderful place to work. Each senator was accorded
                    full sovereignty and dignity and rights. The senators saw themselves as
                    independent, but as equals as well. Senator's staffs were accorded the same
                    rights, respect and dignity in due measure of course. All 100 senators had the
                    access to all of the parts of the institution as did their staffs. Everything
                    was open. There was no place except one in the Senate that I couldn't go with
                    ease - no badges, no x-raying madness. There was only one place which was out of
                    bounds, which was the “Baths”, the Senate swimming pool. That was reserved for
                    senators. If you were not a senator, you couldn't even approach it.</p>
                <p>For me, the Senate was a great learning experience about my own country. I really
                    saw America in all its variety. The people came fro all over the country, with
                    their petitions, they came with their grievances, they came with their hopes,
                    and every senate office was open to our people. Cooper, particularly, loved to
                    see his constituents. I remember one occasion where a group of Catholic nuns
                    came from LouisvillCooper was a Presbyteriahe said, “I love nuns. They're so
                    pure,” and he would take them into his office and take enormous pleasure in just
                    listening to them and sort of beam. Of course, his schedule would go out the
                    window with them. That was when I learned, that the most important skill for a
                    democratic leader is to listen to your people, hear their concerns and don't
                    worry about scheduling.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>On substance: the substantive work of the Senate was organized around the
                    legislative schedule put together by agreement of the leaders both Democratic
                    and Republican. When I came to the Senate in 1967, the leaders were Mike
                    Mansfield and Hugh Scott. Mansfield and Scott decided what would be taken up on
                    the floor and what would be coming up, the bills. Cooper expected me to learn
                    everything in my area of foreign policy and defense issues, and more,
                    everything. I wrote speeches, I did the research, I prepared the hearings. I sat
                    on the floor of the Senate when speeches I had written were given by Senator
                    Cooper, sitting on an appropriately smaller chair next to Senator Cooper as he
                    gave his speeches. It was like being in a special club. I spent as much time as
                    possible on the floor of the Senate with my more knowledgeable colleagues. I was
                    welcome in the cloak rooms of both parties. In time, I came to know all 100
                    senators and their staff. We were all very close. It was a way of life that was
                    full and enriching at that stage, perhaps because the issues were so compelling
                    and pervasive, not only Vietnam, which was really about the power of making of
                    wathe question of who makes war? For many of us, that became the overriding
                    conceptual and intellectual issue. At that time, what we called framework
                    legislation was very much the most important legislative work to be done. We
                    were contending with issues such as the efficacy of the Constitution's
                    war-making provision. If it is not adequate or too vague, for present
                    conditions, how do you write legislation that doesn't violate or abridge the
                    constitution, but strengthens it? The Gulf of Tonkin issue, the whole problem of
                    executive orders, of secret commands given by the executive were part of the
                    agenda. Can the executive take the country to war without Congressional
                    approval? All of these things were behind the legislative drive of the best of
                    the senators. Cooper was one of them, so was Mansfield, and Fulbright,
                    certainly, after his conversion, post-Gulf of Tonkin, when he realized he had
                    been lied to. George Aiken, Phil Harthe Senate was a great panoply of very
                    thoughtful, senators who saw each other as colleagues and even as brothers in a
                    sense doing vitally important legislative tasks.</p>
                <p>Framework legislation was the first priority, and the always numerous necessary
                    day-to-day legislation was given its due place. There were other “framework”
                    issues beyond Vietnam. One of the most important had to do with nuclear weapons,
                    and this is where I really began my work on nuclear weaponry. The core issue
                    then was, the ABM ?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The anti-ballistic missiles debate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. The complicated AMB-ICBoffensive weaponNPT debate arises in 1967,
                    shortly after I come to the Senate. In 1967, a group of scientists who had built
                    our nuclear weaponry at Los Alamos and at other laboratories, in the early days
                    under Robert Oppenheimer, some of whom were presidential science advisors, were
                    also the leading physicists teaching at our major universities and laboratories.
                    They believed that the ABM if deployed would cause the escalation into a
                    dangerous, uncontrollable arms race. That was the danger they worried about.
                    This group of nuclear physicists were concerned that a technological plateau had
                    been reached on both sides of the Iron curtain. That it was time to stop and
                    negotiate a halt and a downward trend. The weapons scientists in both the U.S.
                    and the Soviet Union had come to this conclusion through their mutual contacts
                    and discussions with each othein the Soviet Union and the United States. Andrei
                    Sakharov, Evgeniy Velikhov, for example, on the Soviet side, with Hans Bethe,
                    W.K.H. Panofsky and Sid Drell, and Dick Garwin, Jack Ruina, Jerry Wiesner and
                    many others on the U.S. side. The discussions were mainly about the levels of
                    their respective technologies. Both sides agreed that a technological plateau or
                    equilibrium had been reached. It was agreed that a joint effort should be made
                    to stop. They were the first of the scientists to engage in informal,
                    professional dialogue, on this paramount issue affecting the security of the
                    U.S. and the Soviet Unioand indeed the fate of the entire earth. These first
                    rank scientists in both the U.S. and the Soviet Union had conceived and made the
                    nuclear arsenals of both sides. They jointly decided that they had to go public,
                    and take this overriding issue affecting the control of nuclear weapons to the
                    government and the people. The most distinguished American physicists began to
                    speak in detail about their concerns, about the nuclear danger, decided it was
                    necessary to come up to the Hill. One of the first Senators they saw was Cooper.
                    They reviewed the history of the development of nuclear weapons and their fear
                    that the nuclear arms race was spinning out of control. I recall how a scientist
                    of great brilliance and integrity convinced him, I was there at the discussions
                    with Dr. Panofsky, Wolfgang KH Panofsky, a little Hobbit of a man, a wonderful
                    character. He has since become a good friend. He was so lucid and so accurate,
                    so well-informed and so compelling that Cooper said, “You're right. We have to
                    stop it.” Cooper was convinced, that the nuclear danger was the greatest threat
                    we faced. It is a mark of the Senate of this time of how and why Cooper became
                    the leader of the effort in the Senate to halt the nuclear arms race. He simply
                    said, “It's the survival of mankind that is at stake,” and believed it. Senator
                    Cooper became the focal point for the education of the Senate on nuclear matters
                    because his colleagues respected his open conviction on this issue. It is
                    important to understand that Senator Cooper, a Republican, was given the role of
                    leadership on this issue of controlling the nuclear danger by decisions of the
                    “Senate Greybeards”, namely, the Democratic majority leader, Mike Mansfield,
                    Phil Hart, Stuart Symington, Bill Fulbright, George Aiken and Jack Javits. This
                    is an example of how the Senate worked by consensus at this tima kind of natural
                    selection. My job, under his direction, was to organize the education of the
                    Senate by our nation's top scientists. So all these former Presidential science
                    advisors, and this cadre of Nobel prize winners, took enormous amounts of time
                    away from their universities and laboratories, came to the Hill over a period of
                    four yearand tutored all the key senators and their key staff on the realities
                    and history of the arms race and the details of nuclear weaponry. This tutoring,
                    this teaching, gave a substantial group of senators the confidence they needed
                    to take on such a serious national debate. In the end, the Senators knew more
                    than the president and his key advisors about the issue and this fact shaped the
                    outcome.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Not completely. It's very interesting why. A similar debate was going on
                    inside the government, too, in the Pentagon, and the State Department. In the
                    State Department, the arms control and disarmament agency had just been created.
                    They focused on the issues of stopping underground testing and fallout from
                    testing. There was a debate, certainly within the government. It was quieter
                    than in the Senate, but even Secretary of Defense McNamara, at that time, had
                    his doubts. In fact, McNamara came to the view that only a limited ABM system
                    was required, and it was clearly a fallback. McNamara couldn't say no to ABM
                    development because he didn't have the political strength to oppose the hawks,
                    to oppose the military on this issue, but he wanted to. He limited the
                    deployment to such an extent, that the system was irrelevant, and would collapse
                    because of its obvious inadequacy, which is, in fact, what happened.</p>
                <p>Key senators like Fulbright, Cooper, Mansfield, and Symington, Fulbright and
                    Javits and others would meet with McNamara over dinner at Senator Cooper's
                    Georgetown house on 29th and N, for example, and talk about the ABM issue and
                    the possibilities for arms control and would discourse often with the scientific
                    community's leading scientists. The scientists were asked, frequently, to come
                    to the Senate and give testimony, letters were written back and forth, and there
                    were many visits to test sites. The ABM issue was the focus of a fundamental,
                    very intensely intellectual, political and philosophical and tangible set of
                    problems. The Senators made the effort to go to the laboratories, they went to
                    the weapon sites, they went to the SALT talkGerry Smith, the head of the SALT
                    Delegation and the Director of ACDA, was a close friend of Cooper's and
                    encouraged his visits to the SALT talks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: George Smith was the lead U.S. negotiator at the SALT (Strategic Arms
                    Limitation Talks) negotiations were held in Helsinki and Vienna. I went to those
                    negotiations in both Helsinki and Vienna with Senator Cooper. We all knew each
                    other well, were very good friends, and the positive sympathies, emotions and
                    intellectual openness allowed for open, detailed and candid discussions. Paul
                    Nitze was among the negotiators at the SALT talks. He was the DOD “hardliner”
                    who balanced the dove, Gerry Smith and the State Department representatives. ABM
                    and SALT were taking place in the context of the Cold War. The “Soviet Threat”
                    was a major factor in the debate. Could the U.S. rely on any agreements made
                    with the Soviets?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>This process of the ABM debate resulted in the education of the Senate, the
                    House, the public. This education was enhanced through the work of journalists
                    as well as scientists. The main newspapers recognized that the “policy revolt”
                    on the part of the leading American scientists, who maintained that the nuclear
                    danger “Was a public issue, and we have to bring it to the public.” with the
                    help of the press and media did, and they won. They said, “It's time to get
                    serious and halt the arms race.” The ABM treaty debate extending over four years
                    was personally very stimulating. I learned a lot. We all knew it was important.
                    I believe I was able to make a contribution. The work I did then is still
                    relevant this day, because I'm working on a similar issue with Iranian and
                    American scientists concerning ways to strengthen the NPT regime.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 12th of December, 2003. Bill, well, we've got a couple of things to
                    begin with. You were with Cooper during the transition between Johnson and
                    Nixon. How did thafrom the viewpoint of Cooper and his stafhow did that go?</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>MILLER: Senator John Sherman Cooper was an independent Republicathe way he
                    described himself was, “I'm from Kentucky, and my family made our choice in the
                    Civil War to side with Lincoln and the Union, and my family has been Republican
                    ever since.” He knew Nixon quite well. Mrs. CoopeLorrainwho was very social,
                    used to entertain the Nixons in her house, although it was very hard to find a
                    guest list that would be compatible. She was very anxioushe more than Johto keep
                    good relations with the White House. Senator Cooper's anti-Vietnam stance caused
                    the White House great distress, in the Johnson period as well as Nixon. They
                    attributeboth the Johnson and Nixon White Houses attributed a lot of the
                    difficulty to me, I was seen as a bad influence on the senator. Of course, that
                    was the worst thing you could possibly suggest to Cooper, because he was so
                    fiercely independent. He made up his own mind. I carefully respected his right
                    of judgment. We were very close. I liked him as a person. I was very grateful
                    for his confidence in my professional knowledge and this genuine kindness to me.
                    The war was something he had made his mind up about in Vietnam itself, when he
                    saw at first hand how the war was being prosecuted and the effect it was having
                    on the country, both countries, Vietnam and the United States. Cooper was deeply
                    affected by World War II. He had seen a great deal of bloodshed and destruction.
                    He saw war as the failure of civilization.</p>
                <p>The White House put a lot of effort into trying to get him back, in support of
                    the Administration position on Vietnam. They worked usually through
                    Congressional relations, and, of course, the efforts to persuade were was to no
                    avail. The reason they were not able to sway Cooper was not only his steadfast
                    judgment based on his direct experience in Vietnam, and his deep study of the
                    matter, but also because his closest colleagues in the Senate were very united
                    on these questions. The colleagues who were of greatest importance to Cooper
                    were Aiken and Mansfield and later, Javits, Percy, Fulbright, Symington and of
                    course, that group represented the majority consensus view of the Senate. The
                    Senate is one of the most tightly-bonded group of human beings you can imagine,
                    and it certainly was even more tightly bonded in those years of intense debate
                    and the prevailing belief that the Senate had a very crucial play in the
                    republic, in the fate of the republic. Senate solidarity was very strong.</p>
                <p>We used to have discussions at the dinner table, at dinners at the Coopers, with
                    the political elite of Washington, and the journalistic elite, where everyone
                    spoke openly about Nixon. Mrs. Cooper got very upset about this openness, and
                    she called me one day and said, “Come have lunch with me,” and I said, “Of
                    course, yes.” We had lunch and she asked, “Why do you dislike Nixon so much? He
                    is our president, after all.” So I gave her my reasons Nixon's duplicitthis
                    lunch took place, this particular discussion about Nixon took place at a
                    Watergate restaurant. I said to Lorraine, “He did those things he is accused of.
                    You know that. And he's going to be impeached.” She said, “Impeached? Never,
                    never. This iyou're politically immature, you just don't know the politics of
                    this town,” says she. We were very good friends. We were very fond of each
                    other, so we could talk very directly. But she made it clear that I was in the
                    doghouse, so to speak. Then, later after, the impeachment, Lorraine very
                    graciously said that I was, unfortunately, correct, and that the whole
                    administration was going down the tubes.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>It was very hard for the White House, any White House, to deal with Cooper,
                    because he was so respected, so courtly, he was so polite and distinguished in
                    his manner that they couldn't attack him personally. The only way they could
                    approach him was to be polite and reasonable. And, of course, the reasons, the
                    evidence, didn't hold up on their side. McNamara was a frequent dinner
                    companion, in the Johnson time, McNamara was there at the Coopers often. He was
                    a good friend of theirs, and became a good friend of mine. He still is to this
                    day. It was a way for him to hear what people thought without being attacked
                    personally. The Coopers were kind to him. He was under tremendous stress,
                    Vietnam affected his familhis children were opposed to the war and angry with
                    him. His wife was opposed to the war and angry with him, so we all understood
                    that McNamara was under tremendous personal strain. The issues he had to contend
                    with also included arms control, on which he moved a long way from being a
                    builder of more and bigger weapons to the very different considered belief that
                    they were a scourge and should be limited and if possible eliminated. In arms
                    control, he was one of the major reasons the limitation of ABM and SALT took
                    place. These realities were achieved because he understood the technological
                    argument that we had reached a plateau of nuclear weaponry. His support of a
                    limited system for the ABM coverage of some of the cities in the United States
                    was the minimum you could get away with in the Pentagon, and the maximum you
                    could get away with politically. That's, of course, where it came out - a
                    two-site system was authorized, but never built.</p>
                <p>What Cooper would do, at every stage in these matters of importance to the White
                    House, was to always tell them what he was going to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say tell thewho was ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: White House. He'd tell the president. On the big issues, he'd go see the
                    president. He was always on that basis with the President. Of course, we met
                    also with the cabinet officers, but if it was a big issue like an anti-war
                    amendment or ABM, he'd go and see the president and say, “This is what I am
                    going to do, and these are my reasons. Send your people to me, if you want, but
                    this is my position.” He would do this long in advance. I have to say, he was
                    one of the most endurable people I have ever met. He would come to a position,
                    and it would be almost impossible to get him to make a change on anything but
                    new, convincing solid evidence. He could never be swayed by anything except
                    sound evidence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, on issues like this, how did he use you
                        and, looking at it, where did you fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it was almost like family, because the Senate offices were small,
                    much smaller than they are now. Everyone was physically close together, so we
                    could see each other all day long. Anything to do with the Foreign Relations or
                    Armed Services committees or when there was relevant debate on the floor I would
                    often sit in the floor of the Senate chamber on a chair next to him, which was
                    then the common practice for senior staff. We'd be in the cloakroom together.
                    We'd often have lunch together with other senators and staff, and in committee
                    we were always together.</p>
                <p>Ours was a very intense personal relationship. He relied on me for accurate
                    information about the issues, briefings from the best most knowledgeable people.
                    I wrote the draft speeches he used to address the Senate. This speech writing
                    process was a very interesting experience, because Senator Cooper was intensely
                    proud of his own judgment, he would ponder, even fight every word. Every speech
                    was an agony for him and for me, because he wouldn't let go of a draft until he
                    had been over every word and challenged everything, changed metaphors, until he
                    was satisfied that the words conveyed the exact sense of what he was thinking.
                    So the speechwriting would take great effort and time. If it was a major speech,
                    on Vietnam or ABM for example, a speech might take an entire week, through many
                    nights, and the poor secretaries would be worn out with the constant redrafting
                    and redrafting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this is before the period of the word
                        processor, so you had to ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We both wrote in longhand. I still write in longhand, and it was, yes, at
                    that time high technology was still typewriters. But in the end I loved the
                    difficult process, because I really valued someone who took every word as a
                    responsibility. I learned a lot, because he had a much simpler style than I
                    have. He had a kind of rhetoric aimed at simple people which I never had. Of
                    course, I had other qualities of writing which he didn't have and he understood
                    that. We were a good team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you see any sort of things spring from his
                        Kentucky roots and all that would come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, his sense of responsibility to the people who elected him. He
                    read every letter that came in. On Vietnam, at the end, there were huge piles of
                    letters on the floor of his officliterally thousands of letters about the war.
                    He was very dear to my heart, because I'm somewhat messy too, but he was messier
                    than I. He would have piles of letters on the floor of his office, two big
                    onepro and con. He'd go through them and say, “Oh, that's from so-and-so from
                    Somerset County. I've got to answer his letter to “Trudy” (one of his favorite
                    secretaries), he called out and dictated an answer on the spot. So coming to
                    understand what the popular will was among his electorate was very important.
                    When the Vietnam War began, the popular will in Kentucky was for the war. So he
                    would answer them and say, “I was in the war, and I know what death is. I've
                    just been to Vietnam.” He'd go out and persuade them. “This is not our war,” and
                    he convinced them. Even if he didn't, they'd say, “John, I trust you even though
                    I oppose you. I know you really think this. You're not doing it for political
                    purposes. It's in your heart.” and it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the influence of a senator on Fulbright and
                        the Lowenstein and Moose that was going out to the area, was this at all
                        much of a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Not for Senator Cooper. Moose and Lowenstein and Pincus, were great
                    Senate staff. They're good friends. They were good friends then, they're good
                    friends now. Fulbright and Cooper were colleagues. There were some things they
                    didn't like about each other, so it was like planets in an orbit. They were
                    different personalitielike different planetout there in the orbits circling
                    around the sun. Some were like Saturn and others were like Venus. But that group
                    of senators, it was impossible to lean on. They came with their decided
                    judgments on the big issue, and what was remarkable was that there was such
                    durable consensus, because they had come to their views individually, not
                    because they were giving favors for other favors given.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they knew I was a major obstacle. They knew that. The White House
                    is not a monolith. On Kissinger's staff, for example, at the beginning, Moose
                    and Lake were Kissinger's chief aides, and they were my friends. I knew
                    Kissinger reasonably well. Kissinger used to call me up, about Iran and ABM.
                    This was because of our Harvard connection. He was a colleague of Bill Polk and
                    others, so he knew of me first through them. And Mort Halperin was Kissinger's
                    chief of staff when Kissinger first went to the NSC. Mort Halperin devised the
                    National Security Decision Memorandum Number One (NSDM-1), which completely
                    paralyzed the bureaucracy. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the one where they sent out and said, “Give us
                        reports on everything.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>MILLER: That's right, The memo asked every part of the bureaucracy to lay out the
                    issueall of them in order of priority. What needs to be done and what should we
                    particularly do about all of the great problems. After two weeks nothing. And
                    after six months, there was still nothing. Halperin knew that that would be the
                    result, and Kissinger, of course, followed that advice when he took over, of
                    having paralyzed the bureaucracy and setting his own course in the resulting
                    policy vacuum.</p>
                <p>Anyway, many of Kissinger's staff were good friends. They were my contemporaries.
                    I would say that most of the NSC staff and the State Department were
                    anti-Vietnam. Most of the staffs were also anti-ABM. These were very, very
                    highly, talented people. I won't say they were disloyal, at all, but those were
                    their personal views. We had very close relations and talked openly about the
                    main policy issues. After all, we were key participants in the debate. I was
                    wiretapped, that I knew, but not directly. I was at the other end of
                    conversations with people who were ordered to be wiretapped, such as Moose and
                    Lake and Halperin and many of the others who were on Kissinger's staff.</p>
                <p>It was hardly necessary to wiretap, because the White House leaders knew the
                    positions of everyone. These views were on the surface. There was nothing
                    clandestine about it, but the atmosphere was very intense. It was a
                    24-hour-a-day kind of life of the mind, memos, telephone calls all the time. The
                    integration of the press in these matters was also very important, because the
                    journalists were on the front lines in all of these issues, in Vietnam,
                    certainly.</p>
                <p>People who had been on the front lines and in the jungle, the battlefields had
                    come back to Washington, and there was such a back and forth of intelligent
                    discourse, nothing like the careful feeding of “embedding”. Reporters in Vietnam
                    were free to go where ever they wished and they went. The Washington policy
                    debate was a very large intellectual landscape, a large unmanageable political
                    landscape, which had very few barriers between them and the White House, the
                    State Department, between the legislature and the journalists. They were all on
                    the same battleground. It was in the best sense, public debate, which included
                    citizen groups and NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) and other nations, too,
                    their embassies and high level visitors.</p>

                <p>MILLER: For the subject of arms control, all of ACDA (Arms Control and
                    Disarmament Agency). The ACDA was very powerful at that point. They had recently
                    been empowered by Hubert Humphrey and the many congressional supporters of the
                    creation of this very special agency. So, in the beginning, the main figures
                    associated with ACDS, Gerry Smith, Paul Warnke and Ron Spiers, Tom Pickering,
                    Phil Farley. There was a whole group of ACDA people who were my neighbors in
                    Hollin Hills who used to go into the Department or up to the Hill together in
                    car pools.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any sort of favoritI don't mean personally

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, he knew all of the leading press reporters and columnists. Many
                    came to dinner at his home in Georgetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Washington Star.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: And certainly bureau chief and chief reporters of the Washington bureau
                    of the New York Times, but the editors in New York, too, and all of the key
                    correspondents. But Cooper saw mainly those that covered the Hill in those
                    years. There was John Finney of the New York Times, the editors of both the Post
                    and the Times, which included the group that had been in the CIA and then went
                    into journalism. There were columnists like the Alsop brothers and Marquis
                    Childs and Mary McGrory. All of the columnists, and the key correspondents who
                    had served in Moscow and Vietnam. All were at the dinner tables. The journalists
                    were very much a part of the Washington social scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told today that the social set is much less, because
                        there's much more scurrying back to your home state or district or
                        something, so that there really isn't the conviviality that existed at that
                        period of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's the case, but I think the so-called Washington social set of
                    that time with its variety of journalists, legislators, diplomats, CIA,
                    scientists and intellectuals existed because they all had shared 40 or 50 years
                    of experience together in battle, literally, in war, in many cases were in the
                    same university before that, and were in different ways all professionals. They
                    made up a group something like what the Russians would call the intelligentsia.
                    There was a bonding that went way beyond contemporary politics. Politics was the
                    last bonding. There were many other earlier bonding experiences, and that
                    included people in the Foreign Service, like Chip Bohlen, Averill Harriman and
                    David Bruce.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>The senior Foreign Service officers, those people who had gone back and forth
                    from Washington and overseas over decades, were all part of it, a natural part
                    of the Washington social set. And, to the extent that phenomenon has grown less
                    evident, I think is regrettable. It's part of the job, I think, and the people
                    who were good at this social life really were performing their professional
                    duties, and it was understood to be so.</p>
                <p>The interaction between the legislature and the executive branch, between the
                    bureaucrats and the lawyers and journalists, it was all seen to be a duty to
                    know each other, in addition to legislators going out to their constituencies,
                    and coming back from their constituencies, really being a part of Washington
                    life. Washington, after all, was and is, capital of the world. In that sense,
                    people like Cooper and Akin and Mansfield and Fulbright, they all played their
                    part and in doing so spoke for their constituencies.</p>
                <p>I saw Cooper at work in Kentucky, and he was just like the people who elected
                    him, and they knew it, that he was one of them. That's why they elected him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sort of sitting from your vantage point see
                        the role of staff people, including yourself, being very much as a staff?
                        Because sometimes I understand, particularly at a later period, it seems
                        like sometimes the staff almost dominates policy in certain sorts of
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, you get accused of that. There were a number of articles written
                    about me and my role. I was called the 101st senator, things like that. But
                    there's a great distinction between the Senator who votes and anyone else.
                    That's the big difference, that's the responsibility. But many of the staff were
                    extraordinarily gifted and qualified, many later became congressmen and
                    senators. They were devoted public servants who were an essential reason for the
                    excellence of the Senate, such as Secretary of the Senate, Frank Valeo, and the
                    chiefs of staff of foreign relations and appropriations Mike Mansfield's
                    Legislative Director Charlie Ferris. These were people, whose qualities could
                    easily have made them senators themselves. They had chosen to serve as staff
                    because the compelling issues were on the table. But arrogance of power, of
                    course, was always a danger. Cutting people down to size was done with great
                    ease, if necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the whole Watergate thing hit Senator Cooper and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>MILLER: That's an interesting story. You can start the story from the break-in
                    and the criminality of the White House approval of the break-in by Liddy and the
                    Plumbers, the cover-up within the White House. Elliot Richardson was the key
                    person that from within the Nixon government stood in the way of the cover-up.
                    His refusal to submit to Nixon's demands led to the Saturday Night Massacre and
                    the beginning of the progress towards impeachment. Richardson brought in Archie
                    Cox and defended him. Elliot Richardson was very close to Senator Cooper,
                    Senator Mathias, Mike Mansfield, George Aiken and a large number of other people
                    on the Hill. Mathias and Richardson were classmates, they were in the war
                    together, they were friends; and their staff, in the case of Elliot Richardson,
                    Mathias and Cooper were also friends. The key staff person for Richardson was
                    Jonathan Moore, he was later an ambassador at the UN. He's still active at the
                    UN. Jonathan Moore was Elliot Richardson's chief aide in the Pentagon, in the
                    State Department, and at Justice. He was a major player in foreign policy,
                    during the same period that I was most active. His wife and family are close to
                    mine, we saw each other often and were neighbors.</p>
                <p>When Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Archie Cox, and he refused, Richardson then
                    threatens to resign. Moore calls me at home. Elliot Richardson calls Senator
                    Cooper, Elliot Richardson calls Mathias, Mathias calls Cooper, they all go to
                    Mansfield. Akin is called, so is Margaret Chase Smith; they all come together
                    almost instantly on this matter. And Elliot says, “What should I do?” They say,
                    “You're doing the right thing. This is a serious matter. They've got to clean it
                    up. If they don't, he's got to go.” That is part of the background of the
                    Saturday Night Massacre, as it was called that I lived through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when Elliot and his supporting group were
                        dismissed by Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and the one who so resigned Dick Thornburgh from Pennsylvania, later
                    he was attorney general. He's a friend. Anyway, he was advised to stay, but he
                    resigned as well. In the end Robert Bork took over as attorney general. That was
                    the beginning of the end, for Nixon. Nixon's attempt to stop or control the
                    investigation of Watergate was the main factor in the consensus that impeachment
                    was necessary.</p>
                <p>The Saturday Night Massacre and how the Senate Leadership reacted recalls how the
                    Senate handled the Pentagon papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did not mention the Pentagon papers.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>MILLER: This was another case in point of the value of constant interaction
                    between legislature and the Pentagon. The chief author of the Pentagon paperLes
                    Gelb, who was put in charge, and many of the other authors of the Pentagon
                    Papers including Daniel Ellsberg were all discussing the content of the report
                    with their colleagues throughout Washington. So what was going on at the
                    Pentagon was already known to everyone.</p>
                <p>After all of the studies known as the Pentagon Papers were put together, nothing
                    to the satisfaction of one of the authors, Daniel Ellsberg was taking place, or
                    at least rapidly enough, so Ellsberg started to bring copies of the Pentagon
                    papers to various parts of official Washington, including The New York
                    Times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Daniel Ellsberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Daniel Ellsberg. He came up to the Hill, and he gave copies to
                    various legislators in the House and the Senate. He gave a copy to Mathias.
                    Mathias immediately went to Cooper, and it was decided to go immediately to
                    Mansfield. Mansfield took the copy, they all read it first and then they put it
                    in the safe of the majority leader. Then Mansfield called up the White House, “I
                    have a copy of the Pentagon papers, and I have read them. I want you to know
                    that.” So that's the way the Pentagon Papers came to the Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by this period, I mean, the White House had pretty
                        well lots its credibility, would you say? I mean, as the Watergate thing,
                        the Saturday Night Massacre, the Pentagon papers and all, I mean, this was
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're seeing ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>MILLER: The balance between the three branches was under attack by Nixon. This
                    was the main issue of governance. The constitutional balance had to be restored,
                    the presidency, the executive branch, the legislature and the courts had to have
                    equal strength and checks on each other's authority in appropriate ways. The
                    balance in foreign affairs, defense and secret activities had tilted way over to
                    a predominance by the Executive. This is the reason for war powers debate, and
                    the War Powers Act, the struggle about treaty making, about who makes war, the
                    efforts to limit the scope of executive orders, and deep inquiries into what
                    actions require Senate ratification, the extent to which the legislature, the
                    courts and the public should have access to information, including every aspect
                    of intelligence. All of this ferment is from the same tapestry, the Gulf of
                    Tonkin being the beginning, the first big lie that really bothered and shook the
                    foundations of acceptable consensus between the White House and the legislature.
                    The Vietnam issue, and the logic and physics of nuclear weapons, and the misuse
                    of power and intelligence in Watergate all are part of the constitutional debate
                    of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is the role of Henry Kissinger seen as this whole
                        thing developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, Kissinger was always understood to be and is still seen as a
                    brilliant person. He was never trusted, certainly not by Nixowho trusted no one.
                    The White House, Nixon, and his chief lieutenants and would listen to his
                    theories and presentations very carefully, and with great pleasure and
                    admiration, but also with great skepticism. It went beyond the White House, the
                    relationship with Fulbright was typical. It was a constant battle between them.
                    Fulbright had several opponents in the intellectual battle about Vietnam policy.
                    Melvin Laird was one opponent, the various Pentagon leaders, as well. Kissinger
                    was another.</p>
                <p>So the hearing process in the Senate, particularly the Foreign Relations
                    Committee, became very important, as debate and as exposure to the great gravity
                    of the claims being made and the shortcomings of these claims were being
                    shown.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it came a little before, but how about the opening

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes. I think he saw, almost everyone saw, it as the right thing to
                    do. You have to recall that for three years before Nixon went to China, that the
                    political strength of the so-called Committee of a Million was being evaluated,
                    and the White House had been told long in advance that their dominant influence
                    on China policy was no longer there.</p>

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>MILLER: This was the Chiang Kai-shek lobby, which blocked all rapprochement
                    approaches to mainland China. They were sort of like the AIPAC (American Israel
                    Public Affairs Committee) is now on Middle East matters, the Chinese AIPAC; the
                    China lobby blocked anything, and for decades they had the votes at least 2/3 of
                    the Senate. But several years before Nixon went to China, Nixon was told they
                    had at best 30 votes in the Senate. Kissinger and Nixon went to China only after
                    he had the absolute certainty that he had the necessary legislative support.
                    There was careful legislative preparations and the work of the US-China
                    Relations Committee, an NGO composed of the top scholars on China whose members
                    came up to the Hill and over several years did the much needed education about
                    the reality in China. Considerable travel to mainland China by legislators and
                    staff took place as well long before Nixon went to China.</p>
                <p>The actual going there was the surprise, but the fact that it was being thought
                    about was known for at least a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about AIPAC, you mentioned the pro-Israeli lobby and
                        all. Where did Cooper fit into the Israeli element?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, one of his closest friends in the Senate was Jack Javits, and also
                    Abe Ribicoff was a good friend. Cooper had been in Europe during the war and saw
                    at first hand concentration camps. He understood. But Cooper was always of the
                    view that the decisions on the Middle East after World War II were a tragedy,
                    that the Palestinians had been given a bad deal from the outset, and that it
                    would come back to haunt all who had played a role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern as the Watergate ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Cooper told AIPAC his view and they respected his candid talk. AIPAC also
                    knew Cooper was not vulnerable in Kentucky on the Arab-Israeli issue. As it
                    happened, my neighbor in Hollin Hills was the director of AIPAC, Sy Kenan. He
                    would bring up Cooper's independence with me very carefully as we pruned our
                    azaleas and hollies. I worked very closely with several AIPAC directors. They
                    were all good friends: Tom Dine, Morie Amitay, Ken Wallock. Peter Lakeland,
                    Javits' foreign policy key aide, was and is a close lifelong friend. Given my
                    views on the Middle East, it helped to have them as friends. We would discushe
                    would say, “Senator Cooper is not onboard, so to speak.” And I would say, “You
                    know why. You know his position and how he came to it.” And they would say,
                    “Yes. We'd like him on the list.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any concern that as the Watergate crisis
                        heated up, that Nixon might try some dramatic foreign affairs venture to get
                        the country behind him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>MILLER: The senators knew Nixon very well. He had been a senator and a colleague
                    for some time. They'd lived with him for much of their lives, but they were
                    ready to deal with him. They were ready. They thought they knew his scope. I
                    don't think people were ever very proud of him, but they treated him with great
                    caution and watched very carefully. It was extraordinary, how tense the
                    situation was. I remember when Nixon came to the Senate floor and senators and
                    staff were invited to meet him, there were a number who refused to meet him and
                    shake his hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at the resignation of Nixon, what happened? The Ford
                        pardon and all of that, how was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: There was a split on whether a full catharsis had been reached. A correct
                    appropriate political conclusiomany felt the Ford pardon was a mistake, but I
                    think in general they felt that Ford had poured oil on troubled waters and at
                    great personal political cost. They understood that the pardon would cost him
                    the election, because there was a great bitterness among many of the country,
                    particularly those who had been targets. But most senators liked Gerald Ford,
                    and liked some of his people who had been House functionaries for quite a while.
                    I had extensive meetings with Jack Marsh, he had been Secretary of the Army,
                    under Ford. He was an able decent man.</p>
                <p>Ford had a very good staff for legislative purposes. Ford was the right person at
                    that very divisive point. The Ford presidency was seen as an excellent
                    transition back to normal politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, from your career, what happened after Ford is
                        in, and how long did you stay with the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Ford period was very important busy time for me, because at that
                    point Cooper retires and I go as Chief of Staff of the Senate Select Committee.
                    This is the period of an important effort to get rid of Emergency Powers and War
                    Powers. 2,300 statutes had been passed since 1790, that gave the president
                    extraordinary powers in time of war or so-called national emergency. Among the
                    emergency powers which the President could exercise without legislative approval
                    was the power to freeze currency, seize all communications, declare military
                    zones, and put people in concentration camps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, would you explain? This was an act that set up a
                        temporary committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>MILLER: This was an ad hoc committee that was set up by the House and the Senate,
                    a joint select committee. Select committees have an equal number from each party
                    and ours had co-chairman. The Select Committee has a limited life, as a
                    committee; it has a requirement to complete work within that specified
                    period.</p>
                <p>At first there were two separate committees: one in the House, one in the Senate.
                    The House Committee was disbanded after some internal difficulties while the
                    Senate Select Committee continued its work. For three years, we worked closely
                    with the executive branch and the Supreme Court on the legal status of
                    declarations of war, declarations of emergency and the powers that were
                    delegated from the legislature to the president as a result of declarations. It
                    was a huge research project, that I directed. Frank Church and Charles Mac
                    Mathias were the co-chairman. Our staff had 20 lawyers, mostly seniors in
                    several law schools who took time off from their law studies to work for a
                    semester at the Committee. We all spent most of our time in the Library of
                    Congress. The first task was a so-called “hand search” of all statutes, that is,
                    going through all laws passed by the Congress from number one to the present
                    time.</p>
                <p>This search of all statutes in the Statutes at Large was necessary because there
                    had never been a catalog made by the government of emergency powers or the
                    special powers of the president, much less executive orders. So, after a year,
                    we had gained a thorough understanding of the task. Our research revealed that
                    there were over 2,300 statutes that delegated from the congress to the president
                    emergency powers. They included 120 secret statutes, which bestowed upon the
                    president extraordinary powers. The committee decided to undertake a “dead wood”
                    operation to eliminate all unneeded or egregious statutes by repeal. We went to
                    every department and agency, “Look over these 2,300 statutes. What do you need,
                    why do you need it?” By agreement with the White House, all the relevant
                    departments and agencies, and with the concurrence of all standing committees
                    with jurisdiction in both houses of congress, we repealed all but a few. The
                    National Emergencies Act, which prescribes the procedure that the president has
                    to follow when he declares a national emergency was passed by both houses and
                    signed into law on September 14, 1976. The president must first state the
                    reasons for the declaration of an emergency, specify in particular the statutory
                    powers he wished to put into force; the declaration and the powers triggered are
                    limited in time. If more time is needed, it can be extended by vote of both
                    houses of congress.</p>
                <p>After the several years of Emergency Powers and War Powers, I took up the issues
                    of secret activities and intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back to the emergency acts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I should talk about President Ford, because Ford was very much
                    involved in the successful outcome of the Emergency Powers Act and he was a
                    great help, a tremendous help.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had Nixon been playing around in this sort of mass of
                        almost unknown authority?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes he had. Nixon had used money from unaccountable slush funds that were
                    triggered by the declaration of a state of emergency; rather huge amounts of
                    monethree billion dollars, for example - that were tucked away in Commerce, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because nobody knew about that, did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Almost no one knew about it. These funds were not accountable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is cleaning up all the bits and pieces of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Right, and what was interesting about the state of knowledge about
                    emergency powers was that the only place in the government that had a partial
                    catalog was the Air Force, which had put some Air Force defense related statutes
                    on a computer program. The Supreme Court, for example, had never had a complete
                    knowledge of national emergencies law. They were shocked, deeply shocked when we
                    brought the realities of the state of the law in this area to their attention.
                    They were also very helpful to our work. Several justices worked closely with us
                    on the research. The Supreme Court was very grateful to receive the results of
                    our research.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, I can see in your office, all of a sudden
                        with these bright young lawyers coming in, “Guess what I just found.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, every day it was like that, and it was very exciting, because it was
                    a benign legislative inquirit was not controversial or partisan in any way.
                    There was some controversy of course on whether to keep a particular statute on
                    the books or not, but most of those involved were of the view that, “We better
                    found out what the hell we have done since the beginning of the republic and
                    then set it right.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but most of the secret statutes concerned the annexation of Florida.
                    But there are other surprising secret statutes. The whole idea of a secret
                    statute is a contradiction for an open democratic governmenbut we had them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Some, say they're taking it back. The Special Select Committee on
                    Emergency Powers and War Powers was good fun. It was wonderful for me, working,
                    for example, with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, the chief justice, all
                    of the clerks, of course, but many of the justices and the retired justices were
                    very intelligent and very helpful. Justice Tom Clark was still active, and
                    somehow he had extraordinary knowledge of this problem. His awareness went back
                    to the time of the Youngstown steel case in 1948. So this committee's work was a
                    way for me to really learn about the workings of the Court, and all of the
                    departments and agencies of the Executive Branch couldn't have been more
                    helpful. The legal community and the academic community, legal community, were
                    all tremendously helpful to us. It was one of the most interesting things I've
                    ever done. It was also one of the most difficult.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Idaho. Frank Church, who had been a partner of John Sherman Cooper on the
                    Cooper-Church end the war amendments. Senator Church had led the cause to stop
                    the invasion of Cambodia. He was a decent, wonderful man, very interesting to
                    work with. He had a great wife, Bethine, who was daughter of the former governor
                    of Idaho. Bethine was, in many ways a better politician than Frank Church, but
                    they were a very good team. The Senate inquiry into intelligence has its origins
                    in the “family jewels” report called for by CIA Director, Bill Colby. The
                    “family jewels” was the list of improprieties, abuses and allegations done by
                    CIA officials over the years. It was an internal compendium of self criticism.
                    Sy Hersh's articles in the New York Times about abuses by the intelligence
                    agencies that affected the rights of American citizens were based on the “Family
                    Jewels” report to Colby. The family jewels was a collection of allegations and
                    evidence reported by members of the intelligence agencies themselves of
                    illegalities or improprieties. They were collected by the inspector general of
                    the CIA in a report to Colby. A copy had somehow gotten out to the press and Sy
                    Hersh. The report included charges of activities by CIA agents against legal
                    activities of innocent Americans. Among the charges were that CIA had made
                    assassination attempts against foreign leaders. It was clear from the public and
                    press reaction that there needed to be an investigation to clear up the
                    situation. Majority leader Mike Mansfield decided there had to be a separate
                    Senate inquiry into the issues raised by the charges of inequalities and
                    improprieties raised by the Colby Report. Mike Mansfield asked me to be staff
                    director even before he had chosen the senators who would be members and before
                    he had chosen a chairman. This was a highly politically charged issue, as you
                    might expect, and the issue of who should be chairman was an extremely difficult
                    one.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The chairman Mike Mansfield first had in mind was supposed to be Phil Hart of
                    Michigan, who was much beloved for his objectivity, fairness and gentle nature,
                    and for the Republicans, Barry Goldwater was to be the co-chairman. Phil Hart in
                    fact had been diagnosed with serious cancer, so he couldn't do it, though he
                    stayed on the committee. Senator Frank Church wanted to be chairman. Mansfield
                    said to him, “If you do this, your chance for the presidency is much
                    diminished.” He said, “I understand, I want to be chairman.” This was an
                    extraordinarily, extremely difficult decision for Mansfield, because he had to
                    put together a committee fully reflecting the spectrum of political views in the
                    Senate. He and Hugh Scott knew they had to choose a committee that could work
                    together on very delicate, even explosive issues, so they carefully chose every
                    member from left to right taking account of the major relevant standing
                    committees, seniority, youth, experience and expertise. It was a true consensus
                    committee. The co-chairmen church and Goldwater certainly was a
                    liberal-conservative balance. As it turned out, on most matters they worked well
                    together.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The “family jewels” had been the primary impetus that led to the decision
                    to create an investigative committee, and some of the charges that came out in
                    repeated, multiple forms, was assassination of foreign leaders, and among other
                    things, the lesser violence, the reading of the mail of Americans, the illegal
                    unwarranted wiretaps, the intercept of telephone calls, so on and so forth, as
                    well as covert actions that were undertaken contrary to declared foreign policy
                    objectives. It was a whole m�lange of secret, in some cases secret high
                    technology, often violent and illegal activities that had been engaged in since
                    the end of the Second World War and it all needed to be looked at.</p>
                <p>The Ford White House moved first and appointed the Rockefeller Commission to look
                    into the issue of assassinations. The Ford White House thought that that would
                    answer the question, and it would lessen the necessity to have any extensive
                    congressional inquiries into such secretive areas as intelligence. At first,
                    Ford, particularly, and many senior committee chairmen in the establishment of
                    Congress, both House and the Senate, and the senior executive branch, felt that
                    intelligence was too delicate to withstand rigorous investigation by the
                    legislature.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>The Rockefeller Commission, a Presidentially appointed commission, it was
                    believed by Ford would probe the issue carefully, protect national security
                    secrets, do the right thing and lance the boil. The Rockefeller Commission was a
                    failure. It was seen as a whitewash in the view of almost everyone involved. As
                    a result, both the House and Senate established Select Committees, separate
                    committees. The Senate had had the recent successful experience of setting up a
                    bipartisan committee on emergency powers, so the Senate set up a similar
                    bipartisan committee. I think it was to have an equal number. The chairman would
                    be from the majority party, but there would be a co-chairman, and no meetings or
                    votes could be held without the co-chairman in agreement. All staff had to be
                    approved by the full committee. The rules of the Senate required that the
                    creation of a new Select Committee had to go through the gauntlet of review by
                    all the other relevant committees. The resulting approval was extraordinary:
                    Armed Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations and Rules, all reluctantly
                    gave up tremendous power, under pressure because the majority leader insisted a
                    Select Committee investigating intelligence had to be created. Mansfield made
                    the difference.</p>
                <p>He said to his leading committee chairmen, “You haven't done your jobs, but it's
                    not your fault. The system of oversight hasn't worked. We've got to do it right.
                    You will have membership on the committee.” This was the art of constructing a
                    consensus, and it's much to the credit of Mike Mansfield. He was perhaps the
                    only one who could have done this. Mansfield and the Senate leadership chose
                    left wing, right wing, age, youth, intelligence background, no background, every
                    possible point of view and faction. The result was a mirror of the body. The
                    rules that set up the committee also provided that any member of the Senate had
                    a right to know anything produced by the investigation. For example, a Senator
                    could come to the committee and say, “I want to know if my file that's in the
                    FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation),” and the committee would say, “Here's
                    your file,” but these are the rules under which you can have access to your
                    file. The rules provided for clearances, security, and the process for
                    disclosure of secret information. The mandate and regulations for the committee
                    were drawn up not only by the Senate, but also with advice of the executive
                    branch, with particular attention to the security need to protect intelligence
                    sources and personnel.</p>
                <p>The most difficult issue was the extent of access to information that would be
                    permitted. There was a huge fight on the question, which was decided by
                    referring to precedents, meaning in particular an earlier power contained in the
                    Atomic Energy Act of 1945 in which the Atomic Energy Committee had in 1945
                    inserted the following phrase all departments and agencies had the obligation,
                    “to keep the committee fully and currently informed of all matters pertaining to
                    the jurisdiction of the committee.” The language was clear: all information had
                    to be given to the committee. There was no information in the intelligence world
                    that could be denied to the committee. Whatever the president got, the committee
                    would get. There were to be no exceptions. That was the most difficult issue. It
                    was contested repeatedly, but in the end, the committee prevailed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, the one place where it really would hurt would be
                        the divulging of sources of information who were at risk, like Penkovsky and
                        others ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Who were alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, so how was that treated, because this was a big
                        committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it was treated very carefully. For example, the clearances of all
                    the staff. The committee in the end decided on all staff appointments, but the
                    security clearances were made by the FBI and the intelligence agencies. The
                    intelligence agencies, on their part, were very astute, probably to the credit
                    of Bill Colby and Dick Helms, is my understanding, and the people who were
                    assigned the task of dealing with us. And, in particular Admiral Bobby Inman
                    said, “The best answer here is to educate the Senators and their staff on why
                    it's necessary.” So the intelligence agencies undertook a huge security
                    education program. I, for example, I was the only staff person that had access
                    to the information in every single classified compartment, every compartment in
                    existence at that time. At every stage, they would first say, “These are the
                    risks, now here is the information.”</p>
                <p>Storage of classified material and its protection was done well. The people I had
                    who were in charge of security were experienced and from the intelligence
                    agencies. Security of material was a very rigorous affair. There were no
                    instances of leaks. Two people were dismissed from the staff, one for losing his
                    briefcase in a phone booth. The briefcase was given to the FBI. There was no
                    security damage. The other was an unauthorized discussion with a journalist
                    about the deliberations of the committeno security information was given but it
                    was an unauthorized meeting and he was dismissed.</p>
                <p>Maintaining security was extremely difficult, extremely difficult. The discipline
                    required was extraordinary for any place, but particularly for the Hill. We had
                    the requirement of getting space within the Senate building, so they gave us the
                    auditorium of the new senate office building. The auditorium was converted into
                    offices and working space for staff. There was only one entrance, security
                    guards constantly checked all activities. There were frequent sweeps, hearings
                    were held only in secure hearing rooms, such as the Atomic Energy Committee
                    hearing rooms in the Capitol. The staff numbered about 150, half of whom were
                    lawyers, mostly litigators, who were pursuing the cases involving the
                    assassinations of foreign leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>The other half were people from the intelligence agencies, State, and from the
                    universities. We had several ambassadors, for example, Bill Trueheart and panels
                    of advisers on particular issues, of course. We had a number of excellent
                    historians and a good group of recent graduates from the best graduate schools.
                    The historians did our most successful research projects. We had about 55
                    separate investigations going on simultaneously, and hearings three days a week,
                    for a year and a half. We produced 12 volumes of unclassified material and 10
                    times that of classified reports, and in the end we produced a final report with
                    recommendations for action which stands up pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, first place, where did the FBI fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they were considered an intelligence agency, a domestic
                    intelligence agency. They were the ones who keep watch on Americans. The FBI are
                    the ones who wiretapped Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was J. Edgar Hoover still around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, it was Gray at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had deadly ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Hoover people were still there at the top and in charge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That Hoover's great power was that he had his own sort of
                        personal files ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: On many politicians, which he did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get to those and sort of clean that
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, that was one of the first interests, as you might expect. As
                    senators, they wanted to know what the FBI had on themselves, so they went to
                    the FBI saying, “We want to see our files,” which the FBI had to provide. I'll
                    never forget one of the meetings, when the House Committee went with us as well.
                    This took place when the House still had a committee. They went down in flames
                    after they leaked classified information to Dan Shore and to the Village Voice
                    and the House voted to disband the committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>The group that went to the FBI included Frank Church, Barry Goldwater, Mac
                    Mathias, and Dee Huddleston from the senators, and among the House members,
                    there was Pike, who was the chairman, and Bella Abzug. I recall the moments the
                    members got into the file room where the files of each of the visiting members
                    were indicated on colored sheets sticking up from the file drawers so that they
                    can go see their file, pull it out and read the contents.</p>
                <p>So, Bella Abzug, was wearing her usual big hat ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had a big, polka-dot hat. She always had it, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: She ran to the file cabinet, pulled it out and started to put the
                    contents in her big leather bag. The FBI agent leapt to the file, and then there
                    was this wrestling match between Bella Abzug and the FBI agent. It was a
                    wonderful moment. So Bella Abzug's colleagues calmed her down and they all sat
                    at a table. She was outraged, of course, because they had a huge telephone file
                    containing Bella's many phone conversations and all her speeches, and all the
                    newspaper clippings and a host of accusations. Anything to do with X person was
                    thergarbage, thoughtful letters, lunatic letters that said that Bella Abzug is
                    unpatriotic, etc. Barry Goldwater said, “I don't want to see my file. I'm not
                    looking at it. I know I haven't done anything wrong. I have confidence in the
                    FBI.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were these files essentially cleaned up, or did you
                        have access to them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the committee established that they had a right of access to them.
                    They never knew was whether there was more in unseen file cabinets. The claim
                    was that was that the senators had been shown all there was. This was always the
                    deepest problem. Was there more? What hasn't been shown? How do you know?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, gradually, all of the impediments to access to the information we
                    sought were removed and we believe we were able to do serious research and
                    inquiry based on plausibly complete information. The committee, both staff and
                    senators, decide to divide the work into two parts: first, those who are
                    interested in pursuing abuse, investigate assassinations and overthrows, of
                    leaders like Allende.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Allende.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>MILLER: Allende, Lumumba, all of the classic cases. The station chiefs from
                    Chile, Congo and those in charge of such activities were brought in for
                    questioning, and of course when Castro and Kennedy appeared in the records, the
                    issues became charged politically and I'd say that was the most delicate part of
                    the investigation, because they were so charged politically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you also had Senator Edward Kennedy around, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, he wasn't on the committee, but he certainly was interested. Many
                    senators were, of course, interested in Kennedy's girlfriends and the connection
                    with the Mob, Sam Giancana and his girlfriend and the White House trysts and all
                    of that. You can imagine how charged that was, and somehow we kept it contained.
                    Barry Goldwater had a very important role, and Howard Baker, in knowing about it
                    but not using it politically. And Goldwater's approach to all of this, his
                    philosophical view waI won't say philosophy, I'd say his opinion and his
                    dogmatism was that, “All presidents did these things. It was necessary for the
                    security of the United States, and that's enough. That was it. They're all the
                    same. We have to respect the president, and that's it.”</p>
                <p>The others had some immediate partisan interests. Others were just interested
                    personally in some voyeuristic peering, you might say, but most were very
                    disciplined among all of these matters. But seeing the underworld was really
                    something, but extremely dangerous, too. It was dangerous to the underworld
                    people. When our group of underworld figures came to testify, they put large
                    paper bags on their heads. The paper bags with cut-out eye holes were so comic.
                    There was cartoon I remember, I guess it was a Washington Post Herblock cartoon,
                    that shows the committee sitting at the table and in comes a man with a paper
                    bag over his head and all of the senators are pictured as rushing to duck under
                    the table. As it happened, three of the witnesses that came for testimony were
                    disposed of later by the Mob.</p>
                <p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was dangerous for them. After their testimony, several met
                    violent deaths. One mobster was found in pieces stuffed into a barrel floating
                    in Miami Bay. Sam Giancana was one of these gangsters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>MILLER: Sam Giancana, a mobster from Chicago who attempted one of the
                    assassinations of Castro. I recall his testimony before the committee when he
                    was asked about his attempted assassination. The chairman asked, “So why did you
                    do these things? Did you get paid by the CIA?” Giancana replies, “No.” The
                    chairman the asked, “Well, why did you do it?” Giancana, pulled himself up with
                    a look of offended dignity and said in clipped tones, “It was my patriotic
                    duty.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, looking at the various assassination, coup
                        attempts, destabilizing this, were you also looking at thias somebody
                        looking at this thing, were these things really effective, or really
                        advancing the cause?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I said the committee divided itself into two parts. One was
                    investigative, the hunting ground of litigators and trial lawyers who were
                    looking to say “guilty,” or “not guilty.” My colleague, Fritz Schwartz, who was
                    a superb litigator, a good friend, handled many of the hearings on those
                    subjects. The majority of senators and I wanted to deal with the constitutional
                    issues concerning the authority for secret activities, the substance of
                    intelligence activities, the evaluation of its quality and what should be done
                    with the intelligence agencies in the future. We researched and evaluated all
                    intelligence activity in the United States from the time of the Revolutionary
                    War, but with a particular emphasis since the formation of the CIA, 1945 up to
                    1975, and governmental activities that were normal categories of intelligence
                    collection, counterintelligence, analysis, and technical means. We were able to
                    carry out a rigorous top to bottom the survey of intelligence broadly construed,
                    that would be of service to the president and the United States, the congress
                    and in the end as a benefit to our people and our country.</p>
                <p>So, the approaches were legality, utility, needs, what is needed to do a good
                    job? Who does the best job? Is the organization properly structured to do a good
                    job? Should it be revamped, recreated, reinvented? That was the main work of the
                    committee. We came out with conclusion that the best political reporting came
                    from the State Department; that much of the clandestine activity was
                    destructive; and that a good part of the highly touted clandestinely gathered
                    intelligence material was not in fact of great value; that the National
                    Technical Means were the best sources of information on nuclear questions; that
                    there had been a huge misstep in developing paramilitary capability at the
                    expense of traditional humint intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this be Bay of Pigs-type things, or Vietnam/Bay of
                        Pigs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: All of the coups had heavy paramilitary aspects. There may have been
                    utility during the Vietnam and Cuba episodes, but that the fact that these large
                    paramilitary structures lingered long after their original missions distorted
                    later missions of particularly the CIA and the military intelligence agencies.
                    This is where Edward Wilson comes from, with his pearl handled pistols that
                    world of paramilitary soldiers of fortune, the one who was just pardoned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a CIA ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In the eyes of the CIA, he was an out of control cowboy, of the worst
                    sort, and he was a freelancea soldier of fortune. I was surprised that they came
                    up with that conclusion, but I'm sure it was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean pardoning him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but I think that has to do with the attitude of the White House,
                    this particular White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting sort of from the other side saying,
                        from the intelligence people, “You're cutting our hands off, we're not going
                        to be able to do our work?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, no. This was the amazing part of it, that the many intelligence
                    officers assigned to work with us, during the investigation which was a quite
                    extensive number, from each agency, supervised by the directors of the CIA over
                    a period of time, and by the White House, and the successive presidents. The
                    investigation went on for six years. It went into the terms of the Carter
                    administration, and successive secretaries of state and directors of the FBI,
                    including Bill Webster. They were all extremely helpful, and, I think believed
                    they had been given a chance to work out the best solution in the fairest
                    way.</p>
                <p>I was awarded a medal, by the CIA which was a surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, it was an intelligence medal of gratitude for service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feelinthe director of the CIA was Colby,
                        wasn't it at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: At the time, at the beginning in 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That there was almost a relief as far as get the act
                        cleaned up or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, very definitely. And one human element that was fascinating to me
                    was the difference between Colby and Helms. I already knew Helms very well, he
                    was a Williams man, we knew each other later; I came to know Colby well. They
                    had a very different understanding of the legal boundaries for their work. Colby
                    was a lawyer, and he said, “Our first loyalty is to the Constitution. The rules
                    have changed, we have to change with the rules. Under the Constitution, the
                    legislature has a right to do that.”</p>
                <p>Helms was what we called a “kings man”, he believed in the inherent right of the
                    president to have such an arm as secret intelligence agencies independent of
                    legislative checks. There were proponents on both sides of the issue within the
                    agency. On the whole, the CIA did its duty. In any area, CIA thought was
                    extremely fragile they fought tooth and nail to limit giving up full
                    information, but in the end they always were guided by the rules.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you see sort of a divide, almost a war divide? I
                        mean, in the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), these were people during
                        World War II, sort of who were making up the rules as they went, and
                        anything went, really.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, this was interesting, because as part of the final report we did a
                    history of the intelligence agencies. It was a very good volume done by a very
                    able historian named, Anne Karalekas. It covered the origins of modern
                    intelligence from OSS to 1975. We interviewed all of the key players who were
                    still alive, from OSS times through all the directors who were still alive, all
                    of the deputy directors, all of the main consultants and the heads of
                    intelligence collection, and covert action, all throughout the period. The
                    historical perspective, we gained, I think, was unique and the agency gained
                    considerable benefit because they were doing a similar history at the same time.
                    They were forced by our investigation to do it from a perspective that they
                    themselves would not normally have chosen.</p>
                <p>The constituency for intelligence in the legislature, was a net plus for the
                    intelligence agencies. They had to undergo a rugged budget review every year,
                    and for the first two years quarterly reviews throughout the year. CIA actually
                    got more funds, in the end, as a result of the committee findings and
                    recommendations, and more substantial legitimate support. The people who did my
                    budget analysis, that is, the analysis of expenditures throughout the history of
                    the CIA, were former comptrollers of the CIA. They couldn't have been better
                    informed, in that respect.</p>
                <p>The work on the Intelligence Committee was extremely interesting for me, and an
                    important period of my life. I learned a lot and made friends in the
                    intelligence world that I value to this day.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this overall, particularly, and we're talking
                        about in these sorts of interviews dealing with international affairs, how
                        important is intelligence to the pursuit of relations with other
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, that was a key question for our inquiry, of course. There was no
                    fixed pattern. George Kennan was one of those we interviewed extensively, and,
                    as you know, he was in charge of covert action for the government for the first
                    two years after the war. Covert action policy decisions were then made in the
                    State Department. George Kennan ran the French and Italian elections covert
                    actions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 1948 Italian election, the famous or infamous, who
                        could spend the most money, the Soviet Union or the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Communist Party, having robbed the French and Italian banks of all
                    the gold holdings, so the West pumped in more money. Kennan's view was that
                    there was utility for particular covert actions like this one in Italy and
                    France. He believed that covert actions could be used in particular
                    circumstances, and that covert intelligence efforts should then be organized
                    upon the basis of immediate real need, that the capabilities to do so should be
                    in place, if not, covert action should not be used. He was speaking mostly about
                    the covert action structures, not analysis and collection. Kennan believed each
                    covert action's structures should be disbanded after use. In his view, covert
                    action structures were too dangerous to leave in place.</p>
                <p>His sense of the quality of intelligence waand this was a general view, because
                    the technical material was very good and not obtainable in any other way. The
                    human intelligence was only rarely useful, and that was my sense of things, too,
                    having gone through almost all of it. For example, the Penkovsky papers, much
                    celebrated, had very little utility in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Soviet general who was at the Kremlin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Who turned over tactical battle details, but on examination, while it was
                    highly classified secret material, no doubt, and it did tell details of
                    deployments, the knowledge gained didn't make any difference. It certainly
                    wasn't worth lives, and that this was one of the problems of such forms of
                    espionage. The Penkovsky case was daring and exciting, but courage and utility
                    are not the same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any look at the practice, which, I don't
                        know, may still continue, and that is of the stations in our various
                        embassies almost seem to get credit for recruiting people, which means
                        putting people of foreign nationality, particularly in positions of
                        importance, on the CIA payroll, which can, one, be counterproductive, as
                        found out, and, two, often if they do this, then these people are declared
                        off-limits to the State Department, who would be their normal contacts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That was and is a constant issue. Most informed judgments about this,
                    come from the best of the Foreign Service and the intelligence community, as
                    well. This is a matter for the ambassador to decide, to govern. If the
                    ambassador is strong enough and wise enough, experienced enough, he decides.
                    Ambassadorial control in the field was where the committee came out at the end
                    of the investigation. The conclusion was confirmed in a presidential order that
                    said the ambassador is in charge of all operations in his country, including
                    intelligence and military, the only exception being the activities of the CINCS
                    in theatre operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the overall military commander in the area, where
                        you're talking about troops in the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Talking about divisions in the field, armies. But anything within his
                    country of jurisdiction, the ambassador had to know about, and has primary
                    responsibility for. When I went to Ukraine as ambassador, that was the case. The
                    agency declared everything it was doing to me and I set the rules of what CIA
                    personnel could do. The basic rule was they could do nothing without telling me
                    first and had an obligation to keep me fully and currently informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, sometimes you want to croswhere do you go
                        for advice and all. I was interviewing Phyllis Oakley, and she was the head
                        of the Intelligence and Research Bureau, which was State Department's
                        intelligence thing, and she was excluded from briefing Secretary Albright.
                        They'd say, “Well, Secretary Albright has already been briefed by a CIA
                        person.” This is where you start running intbut that's a judgment call on
                        the part of the secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It's a mistake that she wasn't included.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was a serious problem, but it shows how this is an

                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>MILLER: I'll tell you, before I went to Ukraine, of the briefings that I had. Of
                    course, the directors have to be directed, the chief of operations and down the
                    chain to country. My station chief was someone I knew from the Iran times. We
                    worked very well together, and his successors were just as good, just as
                    helpful. So I think the experience that I had in this case, maybe it is a little
                    different than for most ambassadors, gave me the ability to handle this
                    particular question in the field. I knew quite a bit about the intelligence
                    world from the experience I had, particularly in Iran, but also the great
                    experience of the intelligence committee from 1975-1981.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this is the place where sort of the State
                        Department was frozen out and the CIA had close ties to the SAVAK, and, oh,
                        he's a flag understood. I mean, it was not a good situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We looked at all of the instances of covert action. We had about a dozen
                    hotspots at the time, in 1975, and we looked at them all in depth as case
                    studies. We did very thorough case studies, and in depth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Iran? Was this sending up warning signals to us
                        about the relationship between the CIA and the Iranian ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the pattern was consistent. It was the same noise that was coming out
                    of Iran from the embassies and the analysts here. There was an opposition, they
                    said, but it's weak, the shah has them under control. There are always faults,
                    but the Shah is still the linchpin of stability and he still does what we want.
                    He's providing us access to listening sites in the north. We think he can ride
                    out any storm. That was the consistent analysis and the view in 1976.</p>
                <p>There often were sub-themes voiced that he was pressuring, even destroying the
                    opposition, democratic opposition, and that he could be overthrown at any time,
                    which was my view. So, the analyses, I think, were useful. The case studies were
                    done working closely with the agencies, using as a common basis a rigorous
                    review of all available historical material. The agency's history section, which
                    was first class, worked with our historians.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel at the conclusion of this, had the
                        stables been cleaned out, pretty much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No. What was clear was the rules had changed, and the rules were
                    understood, but that the culture was such that it wouldn't change, and that it
                    was a culture that required constant oversight. Perhaps the culture was
                    necessary in order to engage in this work, which on the clandestine side
                    certainly involves corruption of the other side, and which in turn has a
                    corrosive effect on those who carry it out. That was a constant finding, that
                    the cost for covert operators is very heavy, destructive of their own psyche and
                    behavior. The record bears that out, right to the present day.</p>
                <p>So it was an arrangement in a sense, the price of secret intelligent activities
                    necessary for the state was that the legislature and courts, as appropriate, or
                    the executive branch, had to be fully informed of everything that was done and
                    take responsibility for it, for better or for worse.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but all the methods are known, and they all can be fitted within a
                    legal framework, and, in the end, I don't see, from what I understand, of Al
                    Qaeda and the other terrorist groups, that the phenomenon is anything new.
                    There's nothing different between the 17th of November Greek crowd and Al Qaeda,
                    as far as being criminals and willing to use violent and dangerous means.</p>

                <p>MILLER: They were a right-wing terrorist group, and had some association with the
                    so-called colonels' coup. They saw any accommodation with the left, in their
                    view, as something that had to be destroyed. I think this phenomenon that we're
                    living through what we call “terrorism” requires specialized police work, a
                    specialized form of international police work. So far we're applying the wrong
                    instruments by invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and the occupation of those
                    turbulent countries. The 101st Airborne or Delta group or Seals are not the

                        you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We were completing the report, the final report, on the investigation
                    into the intelligence activities of the United States. This was a twelve-volume
                    public document and about 50 volumes of classified material. It was a
                    comprehensive look into everything the United States had done in the world of
                    secrecy, with the purpose of defining, in 1976, what the proper role of secret
                    government was in a democratic society, and how secrecy could be governed by our
                    constitutional processeprocesses that were established several centuries before,
                    and that the United States never had to contend with the kinds of issues we were
                    facing in 1976.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The outcome, intellectually, was the conclusion that secrecy was a necessary part
                    of democratic governments in the 20th century, and that there was no way that
                    could be avoided. However, in a democratic society such as ours, it was
                    necessary that secrets, no matter how sensitive, could not be left to one man,
                    that is, the president. Secrecy required the participation of all three
                    branches, in their appropriate ways. It was an assertion that authoritarianism
                    should not be permitted in a democratic society, and that secrecy held by one
                    branch, that is, the president, would lend considerable power to the possibility
                    of authoritarianism. So after a year and a half of very turbulent, difficult
                    investigations and tremendous struggle between the brancheparticularly with the
                    intelligence agencies, and most difficult, with the president's officthe
                    formulation, which, I think, pertains even now, under the great stresses of the
                    war on terrorism, is that no decision affecting the security of the United
                    States should be left to one person. The president should not be given that
                    responsibility, that such decisions had to be a shared responsibility despite
                    the obvious difficultiesharing knowledge, even dangerous knowledge, with the
                    legislature and the courts. I was very pleased to see the decision of the New
                    York federal court, which ruled that it is unconstitutional to hold American
                    citizens prisoner without recourse to available protections in the court.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Of course, that was a case that I worked with Senator Inouye on. Inouye
                    was the first Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Inouye,
                    many of whose relatives and friends were in prison while he was off fighting the
                    second World War in Italy, losing an arI understood his feelings very deeply. I
                    was delighted by the recent comments of Nina Totenberg on this constitutional
                    case, I think her analysis was absolutely first rate, and such a tribute to the
                    professional quality of NPR (National Public Radio) reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Public Radio, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>MILLER: NPR is a tremendous asset. Well, in 1976, aside from the constitutional
                    understanding about the nature of secrecy and constitutional governmennamely,
                    that it had to be shared among the three branches in an appropriate wathe
                    outcome that affected me directly was the creation of the permanent oversight
                    committee. I was asked to help put together a permanent oversight committee in
                    the Senate, that would address the issues of oversight of intelligence
                    activities, and to head the staff of the committee. That involved drawing up the
                    charter and the committee rules, hiring the staff and beginning the process of
                    regular and routine contacts with the intelligence agencies, preparation of
                    budgets for approval, and the monitoring of all of their activities on a
                    periodic basis. The formulas that we worked out were: first, to have a
                    nonpartisan stafI'm sorry to say that's no longer the casthat all decisions
                    should be made by both parties on a nonpartisan basis to the extent that was
                    possible. There should be a unitary staff, and the highest levels of knowledge
                    and promptness should be the reasons for hiring staff.</p>
                <p>The establishment of a permanent standing committee for the oversight of
                    intelligence went quite well, because there was a spirit in the Senate at this
                    point that this was a very good idea, that the investigations had come out far
                    better than anyone had hoped, and that the intelligence agencies and the
                    president were fully cooperative about the enterprise. So the procedures were
                    set up for the sharing of information, the review of programs, and the analyses
                    of budget and regular oversight activities, including visits to field sites and
                    review of extensive operations, whether successes or failures.</p>
                <p>As an organizational matter, this was a very big job. There was a lot of money
                    involved, tens of billions of dollars in the budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where would the money go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the figures are generally classified.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about on the Senate side. What would be the

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The expenses for the committee? I was talking about the expenses for the
                    nation's intelligence activities. The expenses for the committees were, I'd say,
                    regular not extraordinary, like any committee, mainly the costs of staff and
                    office expenses.</p>

                <p>MILLER: No, I was talking about the expenditure of the United States government
                    for purposes of intelligence, and there the amounts were enormous, and the role
                    of the senators was very important, because here's a Senate committemost of
                    whose work is in secret, so the public never sees it. This is a committee that
                    has no benefits for a politician. On the other hand it's a committee that's
                    regarded with great respect because it's a significant form of power. Senators
                    know what's going on to the extent that intelligence can provide that. It's a
                    bonding of an even smaller group than the 100 senators, who work under very high
                    pressure and disciplined circumstancefar higher presence than anything else they
                    do. So it was forming an organization with a new way of conducting government
                    business.</p>

                    conferences, so the parties chose, in fact, the leaders. This is a very
                    important point, that the leadership of the parties took it very seriously and
                    appointed the best people they could possibly ?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I can discuss the differences between both committees, the
                    investigative committee and the oversight committee. In the investigative
                    committee, senators were fighting with one another to get on the committee
                    because many of them saw political advantage to being in a high profile,
                    investigative committee. I would say, almost without exception, they found
                    intelligence committee work extraordinarily interesting and highly desirable as
                    a kind of professional upgrading of their work, in a sense, and it was something
                    they could use in their other more public worlit had a multiplier effect, and it
                    was, for most of them, extremely interesting, so they enjoyed it, and it was
                    also a way of working outside of public scrutiny, for the most part.</p>

                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>MILLER: A year and a half on the investigative committee and then from '76 on I
                    stayed with the oversight committee until 1981, when the Reagan election took
                    place and I thought I had had enough. It was a very high pressure and very
                    demanding time and I needed a change in 1981, so I decided to leave at that
                    point and go to the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy as associate dean and
                    adjunct professor of international politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the committehow did you finwhen Carter came in, he
                        really had sort of come in with more of a populist approach, didn't he? How
                        did this affect you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Carter was extremely helpful in a direct personal way. He had a sense of
                    intelligence needs; he had been a submarine commander, and he had that kind of
                    disciplined approach to information that really made it possible for a submarine
                    to survive and do its work. Carter's people were very accessible, and on this
                    issue of intelligence they were open. So Carter, personally, was extremely
                    helpful. He was interested, he endorsed the idea of shared information, he
                    instructed his cabinet officers to cooperate fully, and he kept himself informed
                    about it. I went with Senator Inouye, I suppose we had about seven or eight
                    meetings with Carter, the oversight committee, in working out the final
                    arrangements. On this set of issues the heads of the intelligence agencies were
                    extremely important, they were satisfied with the equilibrium that had been
                    achieved, and they did what they had to do to make it work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you fintaking two olet's start with the FBI. I
                        would think, since the Hoover legacy of collecting political dirt and all
                        thawas that around any more? Were you able to get to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I think there wawith people like Webster, William Webster, and the
                    idea that there would be a term limitation on the director of the FBI, a long
                    term, ten years, but still not a lifetime. It was very important, that the FBI
                    should be apolitical it should not be used by presidents to get dirt on their
                    political enemies. Mind you, there was a recent background of several presidents
                    who were very aggressive in the use of this kind of knowledge.</p>
                <p>Webster made a big difference. All of the post-Hoover directors were very
                    sensitive to what had happened to Hoover in his later years, so under Webster on
                    the question of constitutional protections for Americans, the FBI was really
                    on-board and very disciplined. The difficulties between the FBI and the CIA, the
                    territory of where domestic intelligence work and foreign intelligence work met,
                    and what the boundaries were, was very difficult then and, of course, far more
                    difficult now, with the loosening of boundaries because of the new terrorism.
                    The classic issue was in New York, at the UN, where the FBI and CIA stumbled
                    over one another, both trampling on the State Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you finwas the FBI, was there a problem with the FBI
                        sharing its information of who are the bad guys they have identified in the
                        United States? They were the State Department, there were the pro-visa (ph)
                        officers, that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Because of institutional loyalties, information sharing was always
                    difficult. Part of the difficulty was technological, of coursthe storage systems
                    for information were different through all the agencies, and the “concessions”,
                    you might say, were jealously protected and it was very hard to get easy access
                    to files in the one agency with the other.</p>
                <p>The most able people, of course, were those who had long experience, and they
                    knew where everything was, and they knew the people who had the shoeboxes, and,
                    they knew the issues. That will never changexperience will be the most important
                    element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel ththe Soviet Union agents, were they sniffing
                        around all the time? Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. There was a very high level of activity by the Soviet embassy in
                    Washington, the very able ambassador, Dobrynin, who was courted by our
                    secretaries of state and as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps had been there a long
                    time, twenty-three years, he knew key personalities and he was a great help. I
                    would say the activity of the Soviet embassa very large embasshelped modify
                    Soviet policy towards the United States, that the Soviet-American hands, the
                    American desk contingent, which came from Moscow, was a softening element at the
                    end of the Cold War. They became extremely helpful.</p>
                <p>To a far lesser degree, the American group in Moscow, I would say, up until the
                    end, was kept under relative constraint, far greater constraint there in Moscow
                    than with the Soviets here. The American diplomats had more of a hard line
                    attitude about the Soviets than the Soviets had about the Americans. Watching
                    them, I think, from everything I could tell, and I know they were watched fairly
                    closely, they were given more and more access, and they took more and more
                    advantage of access. From my point of view, I thought it modified the Soviet
                    diplomats' behavior, so it was a plus to loosen things. The kind of Dr.
                    Strangelove, Soviet ambassador clicking his Minox camera at the big board, was,
                    of course, an attitude of the past.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about relations with the CIA? Carter put his own staff

                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. The biggest change was weeding out the paramilitary component and
                    getting control of covert action. The design of covert action, the approval
                    proceswhich had to include Congreschanged the nature of the game. But the
                    behavior of the Soviet Union also was modified, and the major targets were
                    changing, too, so the once perceived necessity for covert actions was lessening,
                    and the nature of what was needed to be known was also changing and so too the
                    means of doing these things were changing.</p>

                <p>MILLER: What was interesting, I'd say, about post-1975 presidents, in all
                    presidents since that time up to Bush, is they understood, fully, not only the
                    vocabulary of intelligence but they had a sense of its limitations. It wasn't a
                    gee-whiz, whiz-bang kind of game, they had some sense of its value and
                    limitations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of that, of course, came from John F. Kennedy, when

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and the whole Bay of Pigs exercise that we've seen from the
                    post-mortems showed his wisdom in looking at his own Cabinet, and in different
                    ways depending on the importance of the issue and the pressures on a particular
                    secretary of a department. That was extremely illuminating and what it shows, in
                    part, is that the airing, pf a dangerous crisis even in the Cabinet room, with a
                    large group, a group large enough and competent enough to raise contrary views
                    is extremely helpful.</p>

                        particularly the conflict in Iraq, where there is concern that maybe one
                        power, being particularly the Pentagon, under Rumsfeld, is dominating and
                        overwriting a lot of contrary views, particularly those of Secretary of
                        State Colin Powell, and others. The full story isn't out there, but it is
                        developing right now.</hi>

                <p>MILLER: Yes. The intellectual capacities of a president is a defining factor. The
                    willingness to sit down and hear a variety of arguments and study them varies
                    from president to president, as we have seen. This only underlines the wisdom of
                    not allowing any president to have sole access to anything that touches on great
                    power. There have to be checks and balances in place even in time of war.</p>

                    and B-Team issue, you may recall that ?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: A-Team, B-Team. This was an evaluation method which the CIA used, not
                    unique to CIA, when the usual standard analysis was subjected to yet another
                    analysis by a hand-picked review board. That's the B-Team, the A-Team being the
                    agency itself. Here the issue was the quality of intelligence on the Soviet
                    Union, its intentions, particularly in nuclear weaponry and deployments. The
                    agency, over the years, had submitted its appreciation of Soviet power, nuclear
                    power, and as you might expect there was a controversy about whether it was
                    rigorous enough or whether it was too hard line. The NIEs on ?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: On Soviet power were always contested. Mind you, NIEs were an
                    inter-agency producthat is, State Department had to give its views as did
                    Defense and so on. As you might expect, all of the agencies werwell, they were
                    almost never in agreement. The exact conclusions were never congruent, but they
                    were almost always roughly in the same ball park, generally. NIEs were an
                    attempt to give a sense of what the various agencies thought the final judgment
                    was made by the CIA Director. All of the footnoting would be in the NIthat is,
                    the State Department's dissenting view, or DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) or
                    the National Reconnaissance Organization, or whatever.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>The B-Team came in, and this was a hard right group. The B-Team was tilted in its
                    makeup, why an attempt was not made to find a catholic, broad-gauge body of
                    opinion perplexed many who were concerned with the problem of how to improve the
                    quality of intelligence. It was all tilted to the hard-line right, and they
                    castigated the NIEs as being soft on the Soviets and dangerously soft. The
                    committee had to look into the A-Team, B-Team controversy because of the
                    extensive even better discussion of the matter in the press. We came out with
                    the judgment that I've just recounted to you, that the agency had done its job,
                    it was properly footnoted, the director's views were laid out, his views were
                    not necessarily accepted, but any reader of the NIE could see, and by and large
                    it was the best we could do, with obvious room for improvements. We also said
                    that the B-Team was tilted to the right and was making judgments that could not
                    be supported.</p>
                <p>The committee was attacked by the right for this view, and there was a
                    controversy within the committee. Non-substantive emotion about the Soviet Union
                    obviously arose. It was difficult, but because the overwhelming majority of the
                    committee supported the diligent staff work, that had been done. It was bruising
                    because it was a politically charged issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of national intelligence, I've been interviewing,
                        over a period of time, somebody who was involvethe assistant secretary for
                        European affairs, one named Roz Ridgeway. She's quite dismissive of the
                        National Intelligence Estimate by saying, “This is a series of
                        compromises.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I would dispute that. Of course, having been forceas one of my tasks I
                    read all of the estimates on the Soviet Union from day one twell, certainly
                    through 198and carefully. I think they're very good, very helpful, particularly
                    if you are involved in the process. If you were working on having to know what
                    the status of forces was, between, particularly, nuclear forces, there's nothing
                    better. If you really studied the material and read the reports carefully, all
                    the foot-noting, it's a form of ara necessary form of art, you would learn knew
                    quite a bit. They were very high value. But having said that, it also implies a
                    base of knowledge of the part of all the readers. So you could not take a
                    document like this in the abstract, suddenly, a man from Mars reads this and
                    knows the full story, without having lived through the making of these documents
                    and really knew how to read them. If footnotes were suppressed, it would be a
                    different story. They were not, the footnotes were there. If the directors
                    conclusion did not meet particular policy preferences, there was a problem of
                    accepting the NIE as valuable by many occasional readers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, this is also the problem. Here you are, the
                        experyou, and others of your ilk know what these things are, who's saying
                        what, and how to read it, and yet a policymaker is up there having to make
                        rather instantaneous judgments, with no time to get enmeshed in all
                        this.</hi>

                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>MILLER: Then you get to the question of what is necessary for policymakers to
                    know when they presume to head a government as complicated as ours, in a world
                    so dangerous as the one we live in. Can we afford to have people lead us who
                    have not been schooled, at least in part, in these matters? And I would say we
                    are taking a huge risk if we elect people as our president who can't do these
                    things. It really is a huge risk. The fallback is to have staff, including your
                    vice-president and secretaries, who do know, and who can bring you up to speed.
                    The president would have to have the personal characteristics of allowing
                    himself to be tutored by his subordinates.</p>
                <p>Jimmy Carter had that. Of the presidents I've observed, at first hand, in these
                    kinds of situationJohnson, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, ClintoCarteBusJerry Ford
                    was too busy with other things, but he allowed his subordinates to do what was
                    necessary; he was there too short a time to really judge. Certainly
                    ClintoClinton just ate it up. He had this enormous, voracious appetite for
                    knowledge of all kinds, as we know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at two thingone, it was on your watch when the
                        whole Iranian revolution happened. How good werlooking at it now, how do you
                        feel we were doing, intelligence-wise, with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The most important information about Iran was on the surface. It was
                    always on the surface. It was not an intelligence issue, it was a societal
                    judgment, or should have beeit was a judgment about the nature of Iranian
                    society and how rapidly it was moving. I would say it was policy directions that
                    were crucial to our leaders. The judgments about Iranian society were not
                    dependent on correct intelligence, they were not dependent othe kind of
                    intelligence provided by the CIA and the military intelligence agencies, or the
                    FBI or cooperation with other intelligence agencies. The necessary information
                    and analysis was coming from State, from journalists, from academics, from
                    business. Iran was at that time an open society. Iran was not closed. It was
                    wide open, there was a huge American presence; it was easy to have a full
                    awareness of what was happening. It was the psychological problem of denial
                    about what was happening, you might say, and an unmovable comfort with past
                    arrangements that needed to be changed. The public warning signals were very
                    strong. They began in the most dramatic way, in 1976, when the shah had the
                    spectacular Persepolis celebration of the 3,000 years of monarchy in Iran, where
                    he crowned himself, and the great excesses of his regime were seen by all of the
                    world who came to this great mega-party in Persepolis. They could see the
                    poverty and wealth, the dramatic excess.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Iranian students who were here, in the United States 50,000 a
                    year, made it very clear by their constant demonstrations against the shah where
                    they thought Iran should gand these students were the hope of the future. I
                    would say many of the most diligent scholars, and academics of contemporary Iran
                    spoke of the dangers. When Helms went out, in the Nixon period ?</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and he was sent out to Iran in exile, so to speak. This was in '75,
                    in that period. It was very clear that things were rumbling, and within the
                    embassy there was a dispute. The decisions really came down to, in the Jimmy
                    Carter period, when the unpopularity of the shah was extremely pronounced and
                    growing, and the issue was, what's happening? “Is there an alternative to the
                    Shah?” And the answer was, he's extremely unpopular. The judgment question was,
                    do we stick with him or do we support an alternativwhat is the alternative? The
                    debate in the Carter administration was between Brzezinski and Vancthe NSC vs.
                    State.</p>
                <p>Vance was of the view that the shah was finished and we should support the
                    nationalist democrats, as weak as they were. Brzezinski was of the vieas was
                    Kissinger and the establishmenthat the shah had served us well, and we should
                    stick with him. So it was that issue until the very end. A year before the end,
                    when George Ball was brought in to have an independent review. He made a review,
                    and he said, “Support the nationalist democrats,” but it was too late.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Kissinger asked for views, as did Brzezinski, and I knew them both, and

                    his inquiry. The Iranianparticularly the democrats, but also including the
                    shah's peoplI saw them all constantly, as I had done through the years. I
                    conveyed their respective opinions and views back and forth. I think there was a
                    very full awareness of what was going on. The Iran debate turned on the judgment
                    about whether the shah could make it. There was a profound misunderstanding of
                    how deep the discontent was, within Iranian society. The sub-corollary to this,
                    and it is an important one, is how deeply the American experience had affected

                <p>MILLER: How deeply the American experience had affected the elite of Iran.
                    American values were the issue for Iranians in large measure, both positive and
                    negative. The negative view of American values resonated very deeply within
                    traditional Iranian society. The clerics, those who were offended by the casual
                    informality, what they saw as indulgent promiscuity and an assault on
                    traditional values, you might say, the traditional Iranians had a sort of
                    fundamentalist, somewhat similar to some American fundamentalist, kind of
                    revulsion. The positive values of democratic governance, of freedom of
                    expression, which the shah unwisely crushed, had only theoretical resonance.
                    That's something about Iran that still remains to be understood by our leaders,
                    namely, how profound the American effect has been in the Middle East, not to
                    mention just Iran.</p>

                        of this, and other people looking at this and not with these ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Cultural understanding is a very loose term, but it is an important part
                    of the work of Foreign Service, of diplomacy, even now. It has always been, but
                    understanding these great social movements that are in turmoil now, that affect
                    our interests so directly in ways they did not in the past, because they were so
                    far away, so remote, and now no place is remote, given the technology that
                    exists in weaponry and communications. The Foreign Service mission is even
                    greater: the understanding of cultures and where they're headed and who is
                    leading those cultures and where they come from, what their thinking is. This
                    makes the Foreign Service mission, it seems to me, of far greater in importance
                    now than it ever was, say, through the Cold War, where there was an imposed
                    distance, there was a barrier of a kind that was hard to breach.</p>
                <p>But now, that gap has disappeared forever. That's one aspect of my own
                    understanding about Iran. The importance of knowing why Hezbollah, who
                    Hezbollah, and do you really know what Hezbollah is? What are you going to do
                    about Hezbollah bands of popular movements as opposed to small lunatic bands of
                    terrorist killers?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hezbollah being? You might explain who Hezbollah is.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>MILLER: Hezbollah is one of the main groups on our terrorist list. They are Shia,
                    a Shia group that's based in Lebanon, heavily supported by Syria, logistically,
                    and financially in the past by Iran in the effort against the Israelis in the
                    Middle East conflict. In recent years, since Israel withdrew from Lebanon,
                    southern Lebanon, the militant side of Hezbollah has diminished. Their cadres of
                    killers remain, but Hezbollah is a main political party in Lebanon, perhaps the
                    largest, representing the Shias of Lebanon. Their leaders are well known to the
                    leaders of the Middle Eastern countries, including Iran. They're the same age as
                    the American-trained, educated heads of ministries in Iran now, and they had
                    many common causes that we should know about. The Iranians have made clear to
                    me, for example, and to others, that they would be willing to bring Hezbollah
                    leaders together with serious Americans for discussion, and it seems to me this
                    is the kind of thing that Foreign Service people should do, as ordinary bread
                    and butter activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other thing, looking at it again, during the time when
                        you were dealing with the oversight, to the layman, not a Soviet hand, I
                        look upon the tremendous amount of effort we put into finding out what makes
                        the Soviet Union tick and all this, beyond the military, I mean, the
                        Kremlinology, the politics and all this. But, somehow, we didn't seem to get
                        it right. I mean, when the Soviet Union collapsed, as you mentioned before,
                        our embassy was almost a drag on the process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think that illustrates the necessity for flexibility in our
                    instruments. What I mean by that is that embassy officers, let's say the core
                    officers who are singled out early in their career because they seem to have a
                    gift for understanding movements and have the abilities to deal with leadership,
                    and who are assigned in the area in order to deepen their knowledge and range of
                    contact, ought to have the ability to go in and out, and to deal with groups
                    that are outside of the formal structures.</p>
                <p>What I mean by that is to give Foreign Service officers the broadest possible
                    range of contacts, a greater chance to travel, to be involved in the societies,
                    particularly the intellectual groups. For the Soviet Union that put such a high
                    value on intelligentsia, we should target the Russian intelligence in order to
                    understand what's going on there now that the Soviet Union is gone.</p>
                <p>I would say that a number of the Foreign Service officers were very sensitive to
                    the changes as they were taking place in the Soviet Union. They reported very
                    well as they were taking place, but they were not prophetic, with the exceptions
                    of people like George Kennan, who saw it instantly. When Gorbachev came in, he
                    said, “This man is different,” and that judgment came out of his deep knowledge
                    of the place and its people and even the regime. There were others in other
                    foreign services, colleagues of Kennan who understood that, and certainly in the
                    academic world, the debate about the significance of Gorbachev was something
                    that began immediately.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the other things was almost a structural
                        thing. I mean, at the time that you were looking over our intelligence
                        activities, did you see, were we reporting on this Soviet Union really has
                        major difficulties and they're falling farther and farther behind, sort of
                        information gathering and the knowledge business and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: You mean the idea of the Soviet Union as a failed society? Yes, but among
                    the tools that are available to the Foreign Service, I'll narrow it to that. One
                    is access to all the other groups that were involved in the Soviet Union, the
                    academics, the journalists, the nuclear scientists, the NGO world, their
                    advisers. This is where I would say there's a real need, a constant need, in the
                    Foreign Service to bring in the outside world, as advisers, colleagues and to
                    take the Washington life far more seriously than they do.</p>
                <p>The assignment in Washington, it's my impression, was for many a real drag and
                    still is, they couldn't wait to get back out to the field. Valuable Department
                    assignments can be given, but there's also the opportunity to make generational
                    contacts on the Hill. That's an obvious work they have to do throughout their
                    career, to take advantage of expert knowledge of other groups. Presently, a low
                    value is placed on that. There's a lot of busywork, but there's not enough study
                    and contemplation and taking advantage of what the rest of our society knows
                    about the people elsewhere in the world we re interested in. I would think from
                    Bureau Directors on down in the Middle East Bureau, they should be meeting at
                    least once a week with the academics and journalists about what is going on in
                    the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm afraid, as you put it, busywork absorbs our
                        people far too much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think that's a matter of leadership, and that's one aspect of Foreign
                    Service life, as you well know, that you have to steel yourself against the
                    numbing effect of the grind, and as you rise in rank, you have to create space
                    rather than getting constricted. And I think all too often it has the
                    constricting effect rather than the expanding effect, but that may have to do
                    with personalities.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. With Reagan's presidency, there was a profound change in attitude
                    towards all aspects of life. Domestically, the agenda changed, and the whole
                    idea of national security changed. National security became a patriotic value,
                    even if unexamined. It was unpatriotic to question or even examine the given
                    idea of national security, that the tilt was now in that direction, whereas in
                    the immediate post-Vietnam period, the issue of national security was constantly
                    examined: What is it? Don't sell me bill of goods. What is it? How am I secure?
                    What price am I paying for my security? They were asking these kinds of
                    questions everywhere in Congress, in universities, in the press, in the
                    churches. With Reagan, the questions were not asked, rather than acceptance
                    there was optimism: “Don't ask questions about national security. I'm telling
                    you it's national security. Trust me. It's sunshine, and we have to get over the
                    syndrome of examining ourselves. We have to value these American ideals again.”
                    That was a change in mentality by the very people whose views on these matters
                    were questioned, so they came back in, they're saying, “You question our values?
                    We're here again, we're back in power now. Our values are now dominant.”</p>
                <p>I daresay that's been the pattern since Vietnam, back and forth, back and forth
                    on this issue of whether our values can be examined and still be a patriot.
                    That's the issue now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, I'm talking about really just before you left
                        the committee staff, was there concern about Reagan, who was coming in from
                        pretty far right on the political spectrum, that this is going to change
                        what you all were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there was a concern, of course, but there was also a belief that the
                    statutory base could not be reversed, which proved to be largely correct, that
                    the threshold of required awareness had been raised irrevocably. The key to the
                    issues that we were contending with depended on informed awareness, and while
                    that might vary a few degrees in one direction or another, the threshold had
                    been raised sufficiently to never go back to the past where the president could
                    say, “I know this, nobody else should know it, trust me.”</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, I think that's the case. The first two generations of intelligence
                    operatives, as well as Foreign Service officers, as well as legislators, had
                    passed from the scene. This was the beginning of a post-Vietnam generation. And,
                    for Reagan and Reagan's people, confronted with the dramatic change in the
                    Soviet Union, you were having a thorough, radical change, where the threat
                    disappears, and a very valuable political tool, the threat is lost. The Reagan
                    period is so interesting, Reagan himself, but even the neocons who came with him
                    were faced with this conceptual problem of how to deal with a disappeared
                    threat. Of course, they found more threats.</p>
                <p>I've asked myself the question repeatedly, “If a different president had been in
                    place on 9/11, wouldn't the response have been different?” He could have defined
                    it as requiring a police action to deal with a small group of deranged lunatic
                    fanatics rather than suggesting a world conspiracy, and I think that's still at
                    issue. In 1981 what was driving me to go to Fletcher was fatigue, more than
                    anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were at Fletcher from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: From 1981 until 1986, when I responded to George Kennan's judgment about
                    Gorbachev and took over the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, and
                    then later the International Foundation. But my time at Fletcher was wonderful.
                    My friend, Ted Eliot, was the dean. Ted Eliot was a colleague of mine in Iran.
                    He was economic officer at what was one of my first posts, and we were very good
                    friends. Our families were close. He was later ambassador in Afghanistan, and a
                    very fine person. He asked me to come to Fletcher as one of his associate deans
                    and as Adjunct Professor of International Politics. I was happy to do that to
                    recharge, really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think the training of diplomats, across the board,
                        is very important. If somebody says, “I want to be a diplomat,” I'm talking
                        about almost of any country, particularly of America, what did Fletcher do
                        and didn't do, do you feel, to prepare them to be a diplomat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I think you're asking a radical on this. I think the best Foreign
                    Service officers should come from the best universities, places where their
                    minds can be stretched the most. The study of diplomacy is less important than
                    the study of any subject to its maximum, to develop the mind, the analytic
                    capacity to understand new situations, new ideas, new concepts.</p>
                <p>The British Foreign Service, for example, looked for people who were from the
                    best universities and did well in the Classics. Greek and Latin was more
                    desirable than modern history, on the arrogant assumption, perhaps, that if you
                    were educated you knew modern history anyway. You went to university to study
                    things that you couldn't pick up in the normal course of things. Of course,
                    that's a fiction, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I think that the best preparation is deep study in any subject, certainly as an
                    undergraduate. Fletcher's great value, and at other places like Fletcher, of
                    which there are six, perhaps, in our country, like SAIS (School of Advanced
                    International Studies), Maxwell, Chicago, a handful, MA programs, is the mix
                    with students from other countries. In the case of Fletcher, they trained
                    diplomats from a number of newly emerging countries, Pakistan being one, and so
                    on and so forth, and those long-term contacts are very important, I think.
                    China, from 1980 on, sent their young diplomats there. I had in one of my
                    classes several Chinese, and they became very good friends. One of my students,
                    who wrote an excellent paper on Taiwan, which I still have, is ambassador in
                    Egypt now, and he was prior DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission) here in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>That's the value of Fletcher, and, of course, Fletcher provides training in
                    quantitative economics and some of the tools of analysis. But none of the tools
                    of analysis were of such a nature that they couldn't be obtained in the Foreign
                    Service itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm wondering, what was your view during the '80s of
                        political science as performed in American academic institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was deeply immersed in several of the major institutions in the Boston
                    areMIT, HarvarI was a fellow at both places, as well as at Fletcher, in arms
                    control, in foreign policy generally, and then the discussions expanded to other
                    universities. So I had a fairly good feel for academic thinking at that time.
                    Quantification, put it in numbers, bar graphs, trends that were measurable was a
                    first priority. It was a hard approach, in a way, hard meaning politics wasn't a
                    number, politics was soft, so it was misleading in that sense, but the numbers
                    approach was helpful. As far as political science writing goes, the academic
                    conceptual discussions were rather barren, I would say, given the issues of
                    tremendous change taking place in the Soviet Union and other parts of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>The most valuable academic writing was in the direction of history, what actually
                    happened, who the players were and what they were thinking, what they stood for,
                    who supported them. Political science as a science I've never believed in. As a
                    way of thinking, looking carefully at political systems, and comparing
                    institutions of governments and their histories is extremely valuable and
                    important. But the theoretical constructs out beyond the historical framework I
                    don't think were very interesting to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I come from more or less the same background as you,
                        of Fred Schumann and all this sort of stuff, and we learnepolitical science
                        in our era was how governments work, which is very good. But I've talked to
                        people who later on have gone back to universities as part of their training
                        and all, and almost completely there's no relevance for their work in what
                        the political scientists are doing. I mean, there doesn't seem to be any
                        connect there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, well, that's the consequence of quantification, I'd say, is that you
                    get more and more abstract as you get closer to the numbers rather than trying
                    to understand the humans that produced the material for the numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did Fletcher deal with this? I mean, basically,
                        Fletcher is a place to train people to go out and do things in international
                        relations, isn't it, as opposed to being an institution that's going out to
                        teach more teachers of teachers and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I'd say at least in the time I was there, it was successful in what
                    it was doing. It put a high value on area study and disciplines of international
                    law, international economics, institutionally defined, that is, the activities
                    of the major international financial and economic institutions. Yes, I'd say it
                    stressed the practical. But I think the best that one could say about Fletcher
                    and places like it are the collegial beginnings for students that take place
                    there, internationally and among your own countrymen. That's the greatest
                    value.</p>
                <p>A lot of very able people went to Fletcher. My friend Tom Pickering and a whole
                    host of people who were there, were they any better for going there? Maybe. But
                    is it absolutely necessary as a step? No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, but it does open the mind up. In a way, there's a
                        certain self-selection process, isn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You look at this, you look at Tom Pickering and you look
                        at, say, Winston Lord and others, these are people who moved on. Steve Lowe
                        I think was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, he was. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there's a selection process that people don't really
                        know is happening, but it is happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it's the selection process and who is selected that's the subject I
                    want to focus on. That's good, and it's a deepening of the mind in subjects that
                    they might not have otherwise had. But I would say, for Americans, isolated as
                    we are on our continent, we need to go to other places, other cultures. I was
                    very blessed to have gone to England at the end of the empire and Europe at the
                    end of the terrible world war, and to be allowed to see those places at a very
                    impressionable age, and to meet my contemporaries who had that experience. Of
                    course, Fletcher is a way of doing some of that without leaving the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of our people found it a broadening experience and a
                        good experience, slightly different, who attended the war colleges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly now that so many of our people who come in
                        have not had military experience, and who both pass on their knowledge but
                        also understand the military is of great value.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I would subscribe to that. I have given many talks at the war
                    colleges, and I can see that interaction. I think it's very important to the
                    military to have the exposure to our diplomats and people who are doing
                    non-military things. But our exposure to the military is throughout the career.
                    I mean, my first post, I had the military at a MAAG mission in Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, most of us have lived with the military. Looking
                        at it, again, going back to your time at Fletcher, did you have any contact
                        with schools of diplomacy elsewhere? I know this June the Diplomatic Academy
                        of Vienna is having its 250th anniversary, but how about other schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, we went to all of them, because there's a network and the
                    faculty has gone through each other's schools, taught at each other's schools,
                    and the diplomats who become professors either long term or short term move
                    around a bit. There's a community of interest and exposure, and that's
                    helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a different approach, a European approach or
                        individual approach or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Of the places I've seen in Europe, there is a difference. Yes, there is a
                    difference. The Europeans were like their universities. There was far less
                    attention and more individual freedom. Students were left to their own devices.
                    The American schools were much better, much better. The academies of actual
                    diplomacy that I've seen in Moscow and Kyiv, and I saw a little bit of how the
                    British trained their people at the end, before going A-100 equivalent, or
                    A-100, like ...</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anyone that would be in our basic officer corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: With one exception is that for most of the Europeans, you had to get into
                    the training school to get into the service, with the exception of England,
                    where Oxford and Cambridge or London were required to get in. Certainly in
                    recent years, way beyond Oxford and Cambridge and London.</p>
                <p>The specialized education in foreign affairs and of the kind we have at Fletcher,
                    is useful. One can do advanced work at traditional universities, as well, with
                    equal effect, I would say, with the exception of the interaction with pros in
                    your line of work. But what was happening at Fletcher at that time was that
                    fewer people were going into the Foreign Service, and more and more were going
                    into business, international finance and business, seeing that path as more
                    lucrative, certainly, but also as more interesting in their minds, because of a
                    disillusionment with, in some cases with policies, but more often a
                    disillusionment with bureaucratic life. I don't think that pattern and its
                    dilemmas have changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think so either, no. How about the nongovernmental
                        organizations, excluding the financthe other one is not very lucrative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, NGO life is very different, it seems to me. It's advocacy, for the
                    most part, most dramatically evident in the foreign field, in human rights
                    activity. The Human Rights activists have a special mentality, deeper at work
                    using that compelling moral sense that some people have. And they're willing to
                    devote their lives to these kinds of causes. There is a kind of life work that's
                    very important. It certainly was in the Cold War period, in the time of
                    international tyrannies of the kind we've lived through.</p>
                <p>But NGO life, which I know quite well, having spent a number of years doing it,
                    about 10 years very intensively, is a form of commitment, very closely related
                    to the major issues, if it's effective. NGOs are a characteristic of democratic
                    societies. That's very important, fueled as they are by the remarkable
                    phenomenon of foundations, philanthropic foundations. NGOs absolutely require
                    free money that is not attached to governments, but given because of the merits
                    of a particular view or a proposition. NGOs give a kind of focus that is not
                    available to governments themselves. NGOs become an adjunct and impetus to
                    policymaking. They are a remarkable part of democratic governance in a way that
                    is peculiarly American.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, it's wonderful, and we're so lucky to live in this remarkable country
                    that makes such things possible, which underlines the itinerant point of my
                    life, which, I suppose, is that foreign affairs in American democratic society
                    is enhanced by all of these variants that allow knowledge and conviction to have
                    expression. And the contrary is that you can stifle, in the absence of these
                    qualities, extremely important ways of doing things. If you do stifle them, you
                    move in the direction of authoritarianism, particularly in large societies of
                    our dimension.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was President from 1986 until 1992, when I knew I was going to Ukraine
                    as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. That's an interesting thing. For one thing, the
                        committee had twell, it didn't have to change its name, did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It did change its name, and as with many other organizations, university
                    programs that had to do with the Soviet Union, they had to find some new way of
                    describing what had been the largest country in the world. The American
                    Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations Board had a great debate on whether they
                    should include all the countries of the former Soviet Union, or just some, or
                    one. And George Kennan said, “The big one is Russia. It should become the
                    American Committee on U.S.-Russian Relations. And that's what happened, even
                    though the rubric was broad enough to include the relations that Russia had with
                    other former states of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The State Department, you'll recall, had great trouble figuring out what it was
                    going to be called and where it would be placed, whether it would be a power
                    unto itself or subsumed under Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something like that, divvying up at the State Department,
                        probably took as much diplomacy as the Congress of Vienna or something like
                        that, more power plays than one can imagine.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I had gone to the Soviet Union on a trip in 1982 with Lugar and

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are two senators.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>MILLER: From the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Bill Cohen, who was then
                    a member of the House. This was a marvelous exploratory trip in which we met a
                    lot of the new leadership coming into power. In Moscow itself, we really had a
                    good look at the ongoing Kremlin politics. It was a very interesting trip. I can
                    recall going to Zagorsk, the city where the Russian Orthodox Church had its
                    permitted seminary. It was one of the two or three places that monks were
                    allowed to be trained.</p>
                <p>Of course, it was still a museum, technically, under the Soviet Union. The law on
                    religion had been relaxed enough to allow people who were believers to practice
                    their religion, including continuing advanced religious education. There was
                    still no proselytizing permitted, although it did go on. But in Zagorsk, we had
                    this extraordinary set of conversations with the future leaders of the Orthodox
                    Church of the independent Russia.</p>
                <p>It was a deeply moving experience, because it was very clear that religion, that
                    the great enemy of the Soviet state ideologically was not only being permitted,
                    but it was flourishing, and this was certainly an indication of change. That was
                    the beginning of, I'd say, my interest in getting involved in the changing
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you get onto this trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, each of the senators I knew quite well from the earlier days, when
                    I was staff director of the Intelligence Committees. All of the senators served
                    on the committees and they were good friends, Senator Lugar was s student at
                    Oxford when I was there. We have known each other well since then. I had
                    testified on the Hill I'd say once or twice a year on two subjects, intelligence
                    matters and Iran. It's interesting to me, looking back now, Iran was a constant
                    subject for me, and I was able to contribute certainly on the question of what
                    was happening in Iran, throughout my adult life, from the time I first went to
                    Iran.</p>
                <p>But I'd say in 1986 is when this interest in the Soviet Union became a focus,
                    when I was asked by the board of the American Committee, whose chair was George
                    Kennan, if I'd become the director and the president of the organization. This
                    was a small 501(c)(3) organization, that is, a nonprofit organization, an NGO,
                    whose purpose was to bridge the gap between the official world and the private
                    world on matters pertaining to U.S.- Soviet relations. It was composed of people
                    who had had and still had contact with the Soviet Union in diplomacy, science,
                    education, journalism, business, the arts.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>George Kennan, who I had known first in the '50s, felt deeply that fundamental
                    change was taking place in the Soviet Union and that the American Committee
                    could play a very important, present role in the new circumstances. The American
                    Committee had been one of three major organizations that had been bridged
                    between the two countries. Pugwash (a group of scientists) and The Dartmouth
                    Conference were the other two. They were conveyors of opinions and positions of
                    the governments of both sides, as well as that of universities and
                    nongovernmental groups. These three NGOs were examples of track-two diplomacy,
                    and they played a very important part. The American Committee was not a big
                    membership organization. It was always intended to have an active board which
                    would undertake to go to the Soviet Union and were able to have interaction with
                    both our government and their government.</p>
                <p>The board was very attractive to me because of their varied experience. George
                    Kennan convinced me that my lack of knowledge of the Soviet Union at the present
                    time was not a drawback, but possibly an advantage, and that what was needed was
                    intense activity in the Soviet Union to describe what was happening and to learn
                    from that immediate experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got into this in '86. What was the attitude? This was
                        sort of still the early Gorbachev period, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Just the beginning of Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that things reallboth the
                        generational thing, but was this going to be a different Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Most of the board thought that it was going to be a very different
                    Soviet Union, and that reform and involvement in the world community in a less
                    hostile way was the direction that the Soviet Union was going under Gorbachev.
                    The reasoning for that was that Yuri Andropov had begun the process with a set
                    of reforms that were aimed at temporarily picking up of the pieces of the
                    fundamental reforms begun from Khrushchev after the long, deadening regime of
                    Brezhnev, particular the end of Brezhnev's life, when he was a vegetable.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Andropov's previous job as head of the KGB was to know what was happening inside
                    the country, looking out for subversive activity, as well as knowing what was
                    happening throughout the world. A lot of the interesting people that emerged
                    from the Andropov period were experts on the United States. I'd say Arbatov's
                    institute, George Arbatov himself, Fyodor Burlatsky, who was the editor of
                    Iturnaya Gazeta, the leading Soviet literary magazine and one of the Soviet's
                    leading intellectuals, Posner, the Kremlin spokesman with a Western sounding
                    voice, who came from Brooklyn were typical of the Andropov political
                    intellectual cadre. The awareness of having to engage with the United States in
                    a more civilized way was evident in Andropov's attempts to soften the hostile
                    rhetoric. Andropov died after a year and then came the deading leadership of a
                    Siberian, Anatoly Chernenko, the octogenarian, who lasted two years before his
                    death. The Politburo and the Central Committee decided it was necessary to bring
                    in a younger generation after the experience of the last years of Brezhnev and
                    the two successors when the Soviet Union seemed increasingly adrift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about Andropov.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: After Andropov, and Chernenko. The battle in the Central Committee and
                    within the Politburo for leadership was between the major factions. Gorbachev
                    had been promoted by the reformers who had been brought along by Andropov, and
                    the hard-line faction, you might say, the more orthodox group, the rogues whose
                    views were more in the direction of Marxist-Leninist ideological positions. The
                    leading contender of that group, Romanov of Leningrad, who fortunately for
                    Gorbachev and for us was a drunkard and had collected many enemies along the
                    way. Gorbachev had risen from relatively modest circumstances and had found far
                    fewer enemies along the way to the top, was seen as a very amiable, bright and
                    pleasant personality, even among that group. Because of Molotov's vote, he was
                    chosen.</p>
                <p>With that history, Kennan and the other American Committee on U.S.-soviet
                    Relations thought there was going to be a very different way of looking at
                    things in the Soviet Union, and that it was time to press for much closer
                    relations, particularly in the light of the aftermath of Vietnam and in the face
                    of a deep sense of nuclear danger. We've forgotten now how intense that fearful
                    thought was, and how strong the belief was of the necessity to bring the nuclear
                    arms race to a halt. I decided to take the offered position of President. The
                    members of the board, being as prominent and committed as they were, were able
                    to get substantial support from the major foundations for the committee's future
                    expanded activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the major figures on the board?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>MILLER: From the business world there was Donald Kendall of Pepsi. He was
                    symptomatic of the trade between the United States and the Soviet Union that had
                    existed in the past, of the exchange of Stolichnaya Vodka for Pepsi and Fanta
                    soft drinks, and as it turned out, shipping, and many other things that produced
                    money. On the fringe was Armand Hammer of that uncertainty, but that's oil
                    development and a long history of working very closely with the Soviet Union as
                    some have suggested as a fellow traveler, even an agent, as his full biographic
                    history has unfolded. Father Ted Hesburgh, who was president of Notre Dame at
                    the time, and Jerry Wiesner, who was president of MIT, Bob McNamara, McGeorge
                    Bundy, people of that character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in bureau, when you got there, did you see, was
                        there sort of the same division as in the Politburo, the ones who saw the
                        Soviet Union as being sort of cast in concrete and the other ones saying,
                        “This is a real seismic change that's happening.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, what was interesting about this board was that they had all traveled
                    to the Soviet Union and they had been on the ground, so to speak, and they
                    thought there was a change. Where they differed was where the change would end
                    up, but that a process of change was underway, we all agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of in the climate of opinion, there's two major
                        factormore, but one would be on the Hill and have people who basically made
                        their careers anti-Communists, and the State Department expertise, which had
                        always seen the Soviet Union as being a bastion and not a loose
                        structure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's true, but the arms control issue was a focus for that debate, and
                    the majority, substantial majority, a treaty majority, that is, two thirds, was
                    for exploring the possibility of rapprochement, of a real opening. I think one
                    reason I was asked to become President of the American Committee, is because of
                    my long experience on the Hill, for being very involved in arms control issues,
                    and intelligence. And I certainly knew the Soviet estimates and the
                    bureaucracies. That mix, knowing the department, having served as a Foreign
                    Service officer, knowing the Hill, having been there for 15 years in major staff
                    positions and knowing the Washington bureaucracy, and, as a result of many
                    interactions with USA-Canada, I knew Arbatov from the time he first came to
                    Washington. Arbatov came to Senator Cooper's office in his first visit to the
                    Hill in 1967. USA-Canada became the official interface with the American
                    Committee. They made the arrangements for visas and access in the first
                    instance. That access expanded to the Academy of Sciences, generally, and then
                    in the later Gorbachev period from 1988 on, when we were bringing young
                    Gorbachev reformists to the United States, we had direct access to the reform
                    political movements such as the Inter-regional group and to the dissidents like
                    Andrei Sakharov and Sergei Kovalev directly.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The State Department, the Embassy in Moscow for a long time had been a bastion, a
                    fortress, contained by the Soviet security apparatus. It was a very difficult
                    place to work, although not impossible, but all Embassy officials were
                    constrained in their movements at a minimum. It was easier for nongovernmental
                    groups to see individuals in the other sectors of society beyond the diplomatic
                    realm. NGOs were a very valuable source of information, obviously, for our
                    government. At the end of the Gorbachev period, the embassies were relatively
                    free from official constraints, but not completely. Access that was available to
                    the track two world was completely opeeven to the inner recesses of the Kremlin,
                    to every political party, including the die-hard Communists, every corner of the
                    military-industrial complex, the Academy of Sciences, and all the dissident
                    groups.</p>

                        this was not the case, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No. It happened very quickly. What Kennan thought would happen happened,
                    and the opening up happened very quickly. It happened so quickly, in fact, that
                    the idea of setting up an office in Moscow seemed a very good idea. It seemed to
                    be possible to create an operating foundation, which in my view would be a
                    natural progression from the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. The
                    operating foundation would be intended to be a viable way of actively and
                    usefully pushing ideas and stimulating initiatives back and forth. Such a
                    foundation could assist the dynamic, positive movements that were taking place
                    in Soviet society as a whole, beyond the government. This was an extraordinary
                    possibility, because until 1986, only Soviet government initiatives were
                    possible. There was nothing else, no other way.</p>
                <p>A new foundation was created along these lines by the joint initiative of
                    MacArthur Foundation, Carnegie, Rockefeller and Ford and Alton Jones
                    Foundations. They created a foundation that expanded the American Committee
                    Board and added Nobel Prize winners and also included members from several other
                    countries, as far-flung as Brazil. The new foundation board included the West
                    Germans and East Germans, some Swedes and Africans. The idea was to connect the
                    intelligentsia of the Western world that had worked with the Soviet
                    intelligentsia, particularly the Gorbachevians into one Board. Such a foundation
                    was created; and I was asked to be the president of the American part of the
                    foundation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the one in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>MILLER: Moscow and Washington. It was formally called the International
                    Foundation For the Survival and Development of Humanity. That long name, that
                    large concept, was insisted upon by Andrei Sakharov, who was a founding board
                    member and whose return to Moscow after exile in Gorky was partially a result of
                    pressure from the International Foundation Board. We asked Gorbachev to release
                    him, and that we wanted to make him a board member. Gorbachev agreed to that. He
                    was released, and the founding meeting of the foundation, in 1998, took place
                    after a conference, a very Soviet-like conference on world environmental
                    problems and what should be done about it. It was one of these
                    super-extravaganzas where there would be lectures on the nuclear danger and
                    poetry readings by Yevgeny Yevtushenko discussed in his velvet suit reading from
                    his poetry and gala presentations of folk dancing and ballet pas de deux, of
                    course, and opera arias. Everything at these stupendous affairs, was
                    spectacular, as the Russians would say.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the conference, Gorbachev convened a meeting in the Kremlin with
                    the newly formed foundation board and the just-returned Sakharov. It was decided
                    that there would be a foundation, that Gorbachev would support it and he would
                    meet with them several times a year on the subject of arms control, the
                    environment and better political and economic relations between the Soviet Union
                    and the United States and the west, and economic development. The name for the
                    foundation that Sakharov insisted upon was really the correct one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it gave you a fairly broad hunting license.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and the importance of this group was very clear to me from the
                    meeting between Sakharov and Gorbachev, which I may have described to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you haven't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Gorbachev and Sakharov had not met each other since Sakharov and Elena
                    Bonner's return from exile in Gorky. Gorbachev had telephoned Sakharov in Gorky
                    and said, “You're free to come back,” and Sakharov came back. Our board meeting
                    took place in an elegant, very elegant room in the inner recesses of the
                    Kremlin. It is called the malachite room. Indeed, the whole room was made out of
                    malachite, the green mineral from the Urals that is so characteristic of Russian
                    taste. It was one of the favorite inner meeting rooms of Kremlin leaders and the
                    Czars before the Soviets.</p>
                <p>The perestroika group of Gorbachev was there, which included the great historian
                    Dmitri Likhachev, a Leningrad academician, from St. Petersburg, really. He's a
                    historian of ancient Russia who had been exiled early in the '20s to the north
                    to the Solovetsky monastery because of his anti-Soviet interest in Russian
                    history and religion. He had survived that, and was now the tutor to Raisa
                    Gorbachev teaching her about the history of early Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Gorbachev's wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. He was a highly respected figure, a moral force, even in the Soviet
                    times, someone who never accepted the Soviet ideology, but was so highly
                    respected that he was allowed to work on early Russian history and religion as
                    an academician. And there was Alexander Yakovlev, Gorbachev's major
                    speechwriter. There was Tatiana Zaslavskaya, who was the great sociologist from
                    Novosibirsk, who did the crucially important societal analysis for Andropov,
                    that said the Soviet man had developed to such a level that it was no longer
                    possible to rule him in the ways of Stalinist times. It was now (this was
                    written in 1979) necessary to have demokratizia (democratization), perestroika
                    (reconstruction), and glasnost (openness). This was because she maintained, the
                    education, the increase in economic well being, the mobility of the Soviet
                    citizen to see the world, was such that the Soviet man could understand what was
                    happening to him, and in the world as a whole. As a consequence a change of the
                    Soviet system that Stalin had created had to take place. It was no longer
                    possible to control information. Information had to be extended through
                    education and with accurate reporting. Gorbachev also read this report and used
                    it as a basis for his reforms.</p>
                <p>And there were a number of scientists, very important ones, Eugeniy Velikhov, who
                    was the vice president of the Academy of Science, a nuclear scientist, and head
                    of the arms control group in the Soviet Union. Roald Sagdeev, who is now here in
                    the United States, was head of the Soviet space program, and a number of others
                    including the Bulgarian mathematician, Blagovest Sendov who later was prime
                    minister of Independent Bulgaria.</p>
                <p>When Gorbachev was introduced to Sakharov and Sakharov shook his hand almost like
                    a bullfighter. There was no “Thank you very much for bringing me back from
                    exile,” he just said, “How do you do?” Sakharov was polite, certainly not
                    deferential. It was mano a mano (hand to hand). I had been talking to Sakharov
                    at that moment when Gorbachev came forward to Sakharov. I could see the power of
                    this electric situation where they both knew they had a role to play in the
                    future and, indeed, they did. The meeting that followed, this is even more
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>We were placed around the oval table in the Malachite room, and an introduction
                    was given by Dr. Jerry Wiesner about the purposes of the foundation, the whole
                    objectives were to improve relations between East and West, ideas for nuclear
                    arms control and an improved environment, all of these very compelling issues
                    could only be solved by international cooperation. This organization, the
                    International Foundation could do much to promote this, by meeting with the
                    leaders of the major countries involved, and with major public and NGO
                    international organizations. Then Gorbachev gave a review of his program of
                    perestroika and where he wanted to take the country. He went through a very
                    familiar reviefamiliar to the group there, using a rhetoric of great promise and
                    optimism. He spoke for about 40 minutes, then stopped, and said, “I would like
                    to hear your opinion,” and went around the group of about 15 or so of us.</p>
                <p>The very first person, because of his age, on his left was academician Dmitri
                    Likhachev, and Likhachev said, “This is very encouraging, Mr. Secretary. We hope
                    that these changes come about that you're advocating. We all advocate this. But
                    I have to tell you that even in your regime, under perestroika, there is great
                    injustice in the Soviet Union, still. There are people imprisoned unjustly even
                    now.”</p>
                <p>The next person to speak was Sakharov. Sakharov was holding his head in his left
                    hand and his head was tilted toward Gorbachev. This was a characteristic pose of
                    his. Sakharov wouldn't say a word for what seemed a very long time, an eternity.
                    It was only a few seconds, obviously, but then he spoke and said, “Yes, Dmitri
                    Likhachev is right. There is great injustice in the Soviet Union, still, and you
                    have promised to do much about it, and here are 200 cases of people unjustly
                    imprisoned.” He stood up and put the filed dossiers right in front of Gorbachev,
                    right in front of his place at the table.</p>
                <p>Gorbachev looked at this pile of dossiers and handed the file to Yakovlev, who
                    seated was next to him, and said, “I will look into these.” He said in response,
                    “Unfortunately, the law lags behind the reality of society,” Gorbachev said. As
                    a footnote, 198 of the 200 cases came out positively. That is, they released 198
                    of the 200 persons in the files Sakharov gave to him. So this was the beginning
                    of the work of the foundation. We went around the table turning to other
                    subjects like the prospects for reductions in nuclear arms.</p>
                <p>I focus on Likhachev and Sakharov, because I found them the most appealing of the
                    group, although all of the perestroika group were extraordinary. I and the
                    others of the International Foundation saw them frequently and worked closely
                    with them, and I think it had a very profound influence. Likhachev was such an
                    extraordinary decent, appealing human being. He acted as a host of the
                    foundation, when all of the members of the foundation went to St. Petersburg.
                    Leningrad was becoming St. Petersburg at that point. It was called Petersburg at
                    that point. The “Saint” was added towards the end of Gorbachev's career.</p>

                <p>MILLER: But you could see the symbol of change on the buses and taxis. They put
                    Petersburg on their public vehicles. It was not quite St. Petersburg. Anyway, we
                    met in the Academy of Sciences in Petersburg/Leningrad and in the places of the
                    academy, scientific institutes, where the nuclear scientists congregated, as
                    well as academics from other disciplines.</p>
                <p>Sakharov, who I had admired since I first read his 1968 essay, Progress,
                    Co-existence and Intellectual Freedom, which really changed the world of my
                    thinking on the possibilities of rapprochement with the Soviet Union. In 1968
                    when a remarkable edition of the New York Times printed the entire essay. Some
                    time later; Sakharov signed a copy of this great essay for me, which I treasure
                    greatly. This is one of the most important documents leading to the end of the
                    Cold War. The essay is the Russian intelligentsias' appreciation of the state
                    the world at the end of the Soviet empire.</p>

                        or something, but with the apparatchiks, the Gorbachevs and all who had
                        risen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Gorbachev was different. Earlier, in the Leninist period in Khrushchev's
                    time, Brezhnev, these were revolutionaries, and later the nomenklatura. These
                    were the people who were fighting the Whites, who were passing out the tracts
                    and killing their opponents and sending them to the gulag (forced labor camp).
                    Gorbachev is from the next generation. He was a younger man, in his 50s. His
                    father had fought in what the Soviets called the Great Patriotic War.
                    Gorbachev's family were declared enemies of the people in 1936. This is an
                    extraordinary background for a party first secretary. He was a different kind
                    than the first two generations of Soviets.</p>
                <p>All of the perestroika group were different from the earlier Soviet leaders. In a
                    reuse, it was the third generation challenging and fighting against the second
                    generation. The second generation were still revolutionaries. The third
                    generation had not been revolutionaries. They were sons of revolutionaries or
                    they were sons of people who were knowledgeable about the revolution. So there
                    was a generational distinction. Gorbachev didn't fight in the war, he was too
                    young. His father did.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Sakharov was older. He was not a veteran of the wars, but he was certainly a
                    veteran of the scientific effort in the war as the inventor of the H-Bomb. He
                    was a very young scientist at that point. But Gorbachev himself was a giant of
                    the world of the mind. Gorbachev has a very interesting intellect, not of the
                    world of the intelligentsia, in the Russian sense, but he could have been a
                    member of the intelligentsia were he born in the fourth generation. But for a
                    Soviet leader, he certainly had more education than his predecessors, coming up
                    from the roots. He was trained in the law, he had studied comparative law, and
                    had a good mind, was interested intellectually in a broad variety of subjects
                    and had respect for other intellects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, your group, committee, in this, what was the
                        role of your group? Did you set up these conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, we did. We worked with Gorbachev's people, closely, to prepare these
                    meetings. We prepared for board meetings by going into the Kremlin to work out
                    the agenda. We discussed when Gorbachev would be available and when it would be
                    convenient to have meetings and they wanted to be the host. The Kremlin was the
                    host. In some ways, this was a strange groucan you imagine Father Hesburgh and
                    Robert McNamara and Metropolitan Pitirim meeting together in the Kremlin? The
                    president of Greenpeace, David McTaggart, was there, and a number of the world's
                    leading environmental scientists. It was an extraordinary, absolutely
                    extraordinary, time. Gorbachev's relationship with Sakharov was instrumental in
                    this, because he looked on Sakharov as a moral weathervane for his own
                    activities. He took Sakharov very seriously, wanted the approval and acceptance
                    of Sakharov. Sakharov, being the rigorous person he was, would only give credit
                    when he thought it was merited, and he was very quick to criticize Gorbachev
                    openly when he was on the wrong path in Sakharov's mind.</p>
                <p>Right after this meeting, the Interregional Group was formed. The Interregional
                    Group was the major political force created during perestroika outside of the
                    Communist Party structure. Many who were in the International Group were
                    Communists who had burned their cards, or had left the party, formally or
                    informally. They formed a new party made up of a group of political leaders from
                    the various parts of the Soviet Union; Ukraine and the Baltics, the 'stans,
                    agreeing in large measure on principles of perestroika, glasnost and
                    democratization. So they picked up Gorbachev's slogans, and they became the
                    slogans for the Interregional Group, which was really a party of reform
                    democrats. This group included Yeltsin. Yeltsin was mayor of Moscow at the time
                    and a curious prot�g� of Sakharov's. Yeltsin admired Sakharov enormously. They
                    had nothing in common whatsoever, except the respect that Yeltsin gave to
                    Sakharov. Sakharov admired Yeltsin's straightforward intention to destroy the
                    Communist Party, which absolutely troubled Gorbachev.</p>

                <p>The Interregional Group was composed of the younger Komsomol (young Communists)
                    people, people who would have been Soviet politicians in the old order, but were
                    now the leaders to the successors to the Soviet state. They knew they could
                    become the dominant force in the last two Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union,
                    the legislatures of the Soviet Union. This new party, the interregional group,
                    was the great impetus leading to the end of the Soviet Union. They were the
                    great support for Gorbachev's program of reform and ironically reform led to the
                    end of the entity that Gorbachev led and believed in.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape seven, side one with Bill Miller. As you were
                        watching this, were you seeing a change between the beginning of the split
                        of the Soviet Union, the different ethnic groupwere they sort of coming into
                        their own now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Certainly there was an expression of the difference, but at that time
                    there was really no sense of breaking away. The idea that the Soviet Union could
                    be reformed as Gorbachev was suggesting was still a viable possibility. In fact,
                    reform of the Soviet Union was even the program of Sakharov and people in the
                    inter-regional group advocated. They then thought that liberalization of the
                    Soviet regime was possible, and this was reflected best in the effort to write a
                    new constitution for the Soviet Union. The constitution-writing was a huge
                    effort undertaken for about three years, 1988 to 1990. In 1990, the idea of
                    splitting up the Soviet Union had gained powerful support, but not until
                    then.</p>
                <p>Sakharov wrote a draft of the constitution, which I was involved in. A marvelous
                    person, Ed Kline, who was a great friend of the Sakharovs from the human rights
                    community here in the United States. Ed Kline was a major supporter of human
                    rights and was a principal channel for dissidents coming to the United States.
                    He was the founder of the Chalidze Press, which printed much of the samizdat
                    literature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the underground publishing phenomenon ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the reports of the human rights committee in the Soviet Union which
                    were printed in the United States and in Geneva, Chalidze was the founder, along
                    with Sakharov, of the human rights committee in the early 1970s.</p>

                <p>There was one incident that highlights one of the weaknesses and the
                    vulnerability of Gorbachev, in these turbulent years before the end of the
                    Soviet Union. The KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti) suppression of
                    demonstrations took place in Vilnius, Lithuania, in '89, February. The Board of
                    the International Foundation had a meeting in the Kremlin, at the same time that
                    the Vilnius demonstration was taking place outside the Vilnius Parliament, where
                    some deputies were beginning to express the desire to be independent, and most
                    were demanding to have political representation other than the communist
                    party.</p>
                <p>The KGB was sent into action and brutally suppressed the Lithuanians. A number of
                    people were killed. This happened just before we were to meet, so when we
                    gathered togetheSakharoand the other Soviet Board members said, “What are you
                    doing?” They said this to Gorbachev's face, in the Kremlin. “How could you
                    permit this? Why did this happen?” Gorbachev said almost apologetically, “I
                    didn't know about it! As soon as I found out I stopped it.” They looked at him
                    in disbelief, and then Gorbachev went off into a long monologue in which he
                    saiand I remember this very clearl“I feel as though I were in a boat, adrift in
                    the sea, and I can't see the shore. I don't know where this boat is going, but I
                    know I will reach the shore.” Everyone took note of this psychological state and
                    offered advice about the dangers of the use of force and the necessity of
                    restraint in the use of violence.</p>
                <p>It had a profound effect, because this was not the only incident of repressive
                    brutality in Gorbachev's regimthe suppressions in Tbilisi and Baku and the war
                    in Nagorno-Karabakh all reflected the contradictions in perestroika.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: You mean allowing access to them in that way?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, tin a way, you are interfering, because here you

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was remarkable. That's all you can say. It normally would not
                    have happened. I'll go further. The kinds of things that I was able to do, I
                    mean, I wasn't alone but I was one of the few. I helped write the rules of the
                    Supreme Soviet, and I did that by bringing Congressional manuals for all of our
                    legislative practice. The manuals were used and adapted for the Russian
                    condition.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The rules of procedure, basically, Jefferson's rules, I gave the manuals
                    to the person we had brought here to the United States as a young legislator,
                    Konstantin Lubenchenko, who became speaker of the Parliamenof the last Supreme
                    Soviet. He used the manuals, and he gave them to another deputy, Eugeniy
                    Velikhov, vice president of the Academy of Sciences, who was also on the board
                    of the foundation. Velikhov held the manual up before all the deputies in the
                    Supreme Soviet and up before the Parliament and said, “These are our new rules.”
                    So, yes, I was a party to that kind of interference.</p>
                <p>Some time later, I interviewed all of the justices that were appointed to the new
                    Soviet constitutional court. I brought a number of Justices here to Washington
                    to meet with our Justices from our Supreme Court. I saw the Ministers of Justice
                    frequently, along with lawyers and judges I brought from the United States, from
                    the American Bar Association. After Russia and the Soviet Union split, the first
                    Minister of Justice of Russia, Nikolai Federov, was one of the people I brought
                    here. He wanted help in the form of legal technical assistance. I provided it
                    for him. He was a very close friend, and still is. He's now president of
                    Chuvashia, one of the Tatar republics on the Volga River.</p>
                <p>Wile discussing possible nuclear arms limitation proposals, I went to a number of
                    secret nuclear installations and was shown their weaponry. Everything was open,
                    and the same was true of the church and every corner of the Academy, every
                    corner of the Supreme Soviet, the Moscow Duma, every corner of any ministry,
                    including ministry of defense.</p>
                <p>The battle for the survival of the Soviet Union was personified in the rivalry
                    between Gorbachev and Yeltsin. I was there, in the Kremlin, in the Great Hall,
                    when Gorbachev came back from the coup attempt in August. Yeltsin received him
                    on the stage with such visible great contempt, at the swearing-in of Yeltsin as
                    president of Russia. I was present at the trial of the Communist party, which
                    was held in the former offices of the Central Committee, which was then being
                    transformed into the offices of the constitutional court. And I was present at
                    committee meetings of the Supreme Soviet on human rights and arms control. A
                    number of my American and European colleagues testified at those committee
                    meetings.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Jim Collins was an example of our very best officers. He was well aware
                    of what was going on. Collins had the knowledge, respect and empathy for the
                    post. Jim Collins, for example, was DCM and I would see him frequently. I saw
                    the ambassador, of course, and they welcomed the information and were glad to
                    meet with us. I think Moscow of the time was such an expanded world. They
                    hathose in the embasshad an enormous amount of work to do because their
                    traditional mandates and possibilities had suddenly expanded so remarkably. They
                    could barely keep up with the pace of traditional reporting. Then there was this
                    revolutionary systemic change that was going on, which they could not handle.
                    They could observe, they could read all the papers, the mushrooming numbers of
                    suddenly independent papers, and they could formally have many more meetings
                    with Soviet officials, but they were still under constraint of diplomatic
                    practice. The political situation had gone way beyond formal discourse, and
                    except for a few junior officers of the embassy who did circulate with their now
                    revolutionary counterparts, their contemporaries, I would say that the embassy
                    had a full plate that was much fuller than it had ever had during the previous
                    70 years. The appreciation of other parts of the new societgetting involved in
                    other parts of the rapidly changing Soviet/Russian societwas a new but crucially
                    important job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What abouwhat was the role of nongovernmental committees

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: NGOs came in to Moscow in abundance starting after the last Central
                    Committee Congress, in 1988, during which Gorbachev gave his landmark speech
                    admitting “there were white spots in history” and that “it was possible to have
                    different views than that of the party”, - an admission and permission that
                    began the end of the party. Groups started coming in from the West, of every
                    conceivable nature. Russian religious groups were openly proselytizing,
                    missionaries were coming from Salt Lake, Jehovah's Witnesses, the missionaries
                    of all sorts. Every conceivable nongovernmental interest group started to
                    arrive, and they multiplied almost like a plague of locusts. Their Russian hosts
                    began to resist when the numbers grew so large as to be unmanageable.</p>

                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>MILLER: The multiplication of nongovernmental organizations roughly paralleled
                    the multiplication of indigenous nongovernmental organizations in Russia, and
                    throughout the former Soviet Union; it was messy and contradictory and
                    difficult, but all of it was a part of the turbulence going on at the time. I
                    don't think the burgeoning of either NGOs from the West affected the major
                    thrust or useful work of the American committee or the International Foundation.
                    Our board members, testified on the Hill, they would see the Secretary of State,
                    as we all did. When we were back in the United States, there were a lot of
                    meetings to hold and reporting to dthere were a lot of interesting writing of
                    reports and analyses. I wrote “a letter from Moscow” for the American Committee
                    journal, a dozen or so articles which describe events in Moscow between
                    1988-1992.</p>
                <p>The reforms in Moscow were encouraging our major American institutionaformal
                    institutionastructures to get involved in assisting those who were leading the
                    systemic changes. They reached to our executive branch, the legislature and the
                    courts, because a long needed systemic governmental change was underway in the
                    Soviet Union, indeed it was a systemic collapse. There was an openness and
                    desire to have help from our three branches of government, not to mention
                    counterpart academic institutions, and scientific institutions. The
                    International Foundation was doing a lot of joint work with the American Academy
                    of Sciences, with the Academies in Moscow, St. Petersburg and elsewhere in
                    Russia. We helped them make their arrangements, initially, with the American Bar
                    Association, law schools, with universities, and museums. So much was going on
                    that it's hard for me to recall it all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much we were all doing ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We were very fortunate to have an apartment right across the river from
                    the White House, the Parliament, just beyond the Kutuzov Bridge, the Ukraine
                    hotel was a street away. We lived in a pleasant sunny apartment in a rundown
                    Khrushchev era apartment house, Suzanne and I lived there very happily during
                    those exciting years.</p>
                <p>For us, it was total immersion and constant activity, taking part in this
                    momentous change with the most marvelous people, ranging from Gorbachev and
                    Yeltsin to the oppressed gulagis and the Human Rights Group. These human rights
                    people who were able to survive are so remarkable. They are our good friends to
                    this day. I can recall at first we were afraid to meet anyone in their apartment
                    because it would be bugged and it was a risk for them to have Americans in their
                    home. We'd have to go outside and walk and sit on park bencheit was at first,
                    dangerous for our friends to talk to us. After 1988, there were absolutely no
                    inhibitions whatsoever. While sitting in kitchen apartments, we'd point to the
                    ceiling and say, “did you hear that” and go on.</p>

                    highest form of socialism, you might say, because it was so social that you
                    would go everywhere, concerts, then to people's houses, move from one house to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got there, had things reached a pass? I'm
                        told, a little earlier on, by people who served in Poland, who said that
                        they were convinced there must be maybe four dedicated Marxists in the whole
                        country. Had the Sovietreally the Russians we're talking abouhad they pretty
                        well shucked Marx's ideology or was this still a major theme?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was still a major belief. Marxism was still deeply held. The
                    Gorbachevian proposition was that Marxism could be reformed, that the era of
                    change was necessary because of the failure of Stalin and his regime's
                    brutality. The 1968 Czech Prague uprising had a profound effect on Gorbachev.
                    The idea that it was necessary for socialism to have a human face was then
                    widely believed. It is still a strong element of belief in Russia, and as I
                    found, in Ukraine. He believed in reformed Marxist solutions, he believes in it
                    to this day. It's still a strong school of thought in all of the former Soviet
                    statealthough it is a minority view, whereas it was once the only permitted
                    view. The hardliners, who were in charge of the security organizations, were the
                    holdouts, but in the perestroika time, they were the ideological minority,
                    although they were in charge of the security ministries. The August coup of 1991
                    was their last attempt to maintain control.</p>
                <p>And that was the question, whether the ideological change, the “new thinking” so
                    called would prevail, or whether the hard-liners would allow the change to take
                    place. What was interesting, again, was the Zaslavskaya thesis about the change
                    in the Soviet man was correct. She said that the change in socialist society
                    permeated everythinthe military, the intelligence agenciethere was a
                    generational change. The Soviet man was now close to the socialist goaeducation
                    being the big key. She did not think there would be violence. She was right, and
                    the futile comic coup attempt, by the pathetic coup group, was a clear sign the
                    change was irreversible. The Stalinist hard-liners didn't have the conviction
                    that a militant group in charge of the power and security ministries in the past
                    would have had.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>The children of the Bolshevik Revolution had a different idea. The failure of
                    Gorbachev to handle the expectations and demands of the intellectuals, the
                    inability to control or at least steer the new freedom that had been acquired by
                    the younger generation, was the main reason, I think, for the end of the Soviet
                    Union. Gorbachev couldn't accommodate or adapt fully enough to the consequences
                    of this new freedom. The nature of the new idea of governance and freedom was
                    explained in the draft Sakharov constitution. This was a remarkable document,
                    intellectually, and it provided a conceptual structure. The Sakharov
                    constitution described, in 1989, exactly where the Soviet Union was, and where
                    it needed to go to hang together. It had to loosen up in order to stay together.
                    Gorbachev resisted that loosening up. He wanted to hold the Soviet Union
                    together in the old arrangement, in the old Brezhnev concepts basically. He
                    wasn't a big enough mind, although we owe so much to Gorbachev for the capacity
                    of intellect and compassion that he had.</p>
                <p>I should say something about journalists. The American journalists, and British
                    journalists, and all the journalists, from all over the world, including the
                    Russians themselveall contributed to an explosion of analytic writing brought by
                    the new openness. TV also was suddenly free, and television programming was
                    absolutely remarkable for its brilliance and innovation. There were the man on
                    the street interviews, speaking his mind in a very delightful; there were
                    entertaining interview programs of profoundly stimulating, exciting character,
                    and wonderful films. The perestroika films are among the most important of the
                    20th century, brilliant, funny, ironic and extremely entertaining films that I
                    hope, will be revived, over and over again because they were and are of such
                    extraordinary quality. This was a hell of a time to be in Moscow as a Foreign
                    Service officer, as an NGO president, as I was, as a journalist, as a tourist.
                    It was an extraordinary moment and a great expression of the best in the human
                    spirit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about all these things, but one thing you
                        haven't mentioned during this time, and that's often been pointed from the
                        United States, as being the real cause of things breaking down, and that's
                        essentially the Soviet economy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That has no fundamental bearing. I think that's a desire on the part of
                    some of our leaders to think that they were responsible for the end of the
                    Soviet Union. The end of the Soviet Union was Soviet, from within. It had little
                    or nothing to do with us. The awareness of the futility of the arms race was
                    something that the Soviets and the United States both came to, the awareness of
                    the enormous cost was something that they felt more deeply than we did. But they
                    would have borne any burden, any cost, to use Kennedy's phrases, if their
                    security was at stake, and they had proved that, as in the past, throughout 75
                    years if necessary, and they would do it again. They'd do it again now if their
                    integrity or sovereignty as a nation were affected. I put no credence in the
                    neoconservative trumpeting that we caused the collapse of the Soviet Union at
                    all. I think it was an ultimate form of vanity on the part of our hard-line
                    neoconservative leaders to think that they did it. They didn't do it. Like
                    Sampson, the Soviets brought down their own house.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Computers were just coming in. In fact, computers were one of the

                    the first Macintoshes into Russia and gave them to Gorbachev technically against
                    our sanctions, actually. They were little Macs and the ability to have any

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes. We followed that quite closely. As was the case with other
                    leaders from the West, like Thatcher and the Germans and the French, we had a
                    good direct feel for that in Moscow, and Gorbachev liked this kind of direct
                    contact. He found it stimulating and interesting and informative and useful in
                    dealing with his problems internally. Gorbachev became a conduiand he knew he
                    was the channethe world had come to the Soviet Union, because he had gone out
                    and reached out to the world. He became the arbiter of estimates on what the
                    world might do for the Soviet Union. He said, “They're not going to do anything
                    to us. They can only help us.” This is a perspective which goes right in the
                    face of the strategies of spending the Soviet Union into collapse, or using the
                    threat of nuclear annihilation.</p>

                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>MILLER: We had a Chinese member on the Board of the International Foundation,
                    from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was a devoted Chinese communist. She
                    had been educated at Berkeley as well as a nuclear physicisa civilized well
                    educated woman, a lovely woman. The Chinese factor was in the background, and of
                    course, in the future. For the Chinese, their view was that China was watching
                    what would happen to Soviet Socialism. I know this because a few years later I
                    went to China, was invited to China to meet with the Chinese Soviet-watchers in
                    Beijing on these questions at a Dartmouth conference meeting. We had a wonderful
                    conference in 1992. The Chinese included survivors of the Mao Zedong reforms.
                    Their stories about Mao Zedong were absolutely marvelous, a parallel to the
                    excesses of Stalin. As Marxists they saw the Soviet experience as a part of
                    their own historical path.</p>
                <p>The Chinese factor was always a part of Soviet/Russian foreign policy concerns.
                    The Chinese, clearly feared the effect of the changes in the Soviet system on
                    their system, but they concluded, and this was in 1992, the last time I was
                    there, they concluded it wouldn't affect them. The Russians would go one way,
                    had gone one way, and they would not be deterred in their ideological direction.
                    They had their own strengths, their own path, the Chinese believed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, no, no. We were close colleagues and friends. Our presence and
                    activity gave them great power and access, it gave them even greater power to
                    their own new changed government. They were partially KGB, but being analytic
                    and academics who said, “We taught American studies at Moscow University as well
                    as being in the Institute,” Arbatov's expertise became extremely valuable, even
                    more valuable than it had been originally. The USA-Canada Institute still
                    exists, but it has suffered the decline that all the Soviet institutions have,
                    including the Academy of Sciences itself. They have to find new sources of
                    funding and their place in society is much different even though it is still a
                    privileged group. They're one of among many others. New universities, and the
                    reformed old universities are transforming the education system. For example,
                    the privileged place of institutes as opposed to university faculties is a great
                    issue of contention now. I'm sure it will result in further diminishing of the
                    institutes from first place toward the direction of university education.</p>

                <p>MILLER: No, because KGB was disintegrating so fast, changing itself, into
                    institutions under more direct public civilian control. CIA was very interested.
                    Of course, our American board members would tell them whatever they wanted to
                    know. Beyond the analytic side, CIA's covert work, was not relevant at this

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The fundamental necessary decisions had been made by Gorbachev and by the
                    Soviets, that there would be a strategic weapons halt; there would be an agreed
                    nuclear plateau of technology. Gorbachev was convinced that there was not going
                    to be a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, that these
                    nuclear weapons should be reduced to the lowest possible levels. Gorbachev
                    himself proposed zero. The argument became not how large a force you could have,
                    but how small a force you could have. There were many proposals abut minimum
                    nuclear force levels. For example, I wrote a proposal in 1987 which showed how
                    2,000 warheads was the number that would give you at least double insurance,
                    even triple insurance, to be able to hit all targets believed strategic. That is
                    where we are, now. It was a matter of planning. The Russian military are now at
                    that level, too. They're retargeting, of course, to other placeChina.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. The encouragement of high school students from the Soviet Union
                    coming to the United States was called the Bradley Program, which is named for
                    Senator Bill Bradley. His arrangement called for large numbers of high school
                    students coming to the United States. The original proposal was for 50,000. It
                    has never reached that level, but greater numbers of Soviets came to the United
                    States than had ever come before, at any period in their history. Exchanges of
                    professors reached high levels, and the normal channels of academic exchange
                    burgeoned so the IREX (International Research and Exchanges Board) wasn't
                    sufficient.</p>

                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>MILLER: This is the NGO that for many years handled student exchange from abroad.
                    IREX was the main channel of student and academic exchange with the Soviet
                    Union. IREX was funded by the academic institutions in the United States and the
                    major foundations as a logistical clearing house for getting visas and handling
                    travel and housing. So a number of new organizations supplemented what IREX had
                    been doing all throughout the Soviet period.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, of course, until Gorbachev, the United States was seen as a
                    bourgeois, failing capitalist society. But it all changed when the Soviets
                    themselves traveled to the United States. It was what was learned directly while
                    traveling in the United States that caused a change in textbooks and overall
                    perceptions of the United States. I'll never forget the remarks of a fellow
                    named Yuri Travkin, who was head of the transportation workers union, and a
                    deputy in the Supreme Soviet. When he went out to the West for the first time,
                    he came back and gave a speech in the Supreme Soviet, saying “I've been deceived
                    my all of my life. The scales have dropped from my eyes. The West is not what
                    they told us! It's utterly different. We have been living a great sham. We have
                    to reform.” So I'm deeply convinced that we should bring Russians here to see
                    the reality.</p>

                        Gorbachev, when Yeltsin came into his own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was, at the time, was there concern that the coup people
                        might bring it off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, of course, but there was also the suspicion that Gorbachev was part
                    of the coup. That's a thought that persists to this day, that Gorbachev was
                    trying, in some way, to get rid of Yeltsin, that Yeltsin was such a threat to
                    Gorbachev that this coup may have been a clumsy effort to get rid of Yeltsin.
                    Yeltsin was warned by the KGB in Moscow and he escapehe was about to be
                    captured. When I was ambassador in Ukraine I stayed at Foros there, where
                    Gorbachev had been seized by KGB.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In the Crimea, yes, in the CrimeForos is in the southwest coast of the
                    Crimea. It is a beautiful place, and with a magnificent dacha. The director of
                    Foros told me details during my stay there in 1996, of the days of the coup. He
                    was there at the time of the coup. He said that during the coup, Gorbachev
                    always had full communications with Moscow, he was very well-treated. The
                    director believed that Gorbachev was really free to leave, but did not do so
                    until Yeltsin sent Sergei Shakhrai down with a plane to bring him back after the
                    coup effort collapsed. The Director of Foros believed that Gorbachev was part of
                    the coup. I know that Yeltsin's people believed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, I mean, before and all, how were you
                        observing your committee and you yourself the rise of Yeltsin or the
                        appearance of Yeltsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, we saw that very directly. I saw it really directly because we were
                    in close contact with Yeltsin's key aides who we had brought to the United
                    States on exchange visits. Some of Yeltsin's closest aides were among the young
                    leaders that were chosen to go to the United States under our auspices, and they
                    were very important. They included some of Yeltsin's chief advisors. Yeltsin's
                    staff were those who decided the Soviet Union was an empty shell and going with
                    Russia. Russia, they believed, was where their future lay. Most of the young
                    people chosen by Gorbachev's perestroika cadre went with Russia when they saw
                    the end coming. Fortunately, our contacts with Yeltsin and his chief aides were
                    extremely good.</p>
                <p>After Sakharov's death in 1989, Yeltsin, who admired Sakharov greatly, was very
                    solicitous of Yelena Bonner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: His wife. She was a good friend, and still is a good friend of mine. We
                    worked together on a number of matters of human rights issues and continue to do
                    so. I am presently on the board of the Sakharov Foundation. Yelena Bonner is the
                    chairman.</p>
                <p>Our contacts with the Yeltsin group, in early years of the Russian Republic were
                    very close, particularly in the new Parliament, the new courts, the
                    constitutional court, the Supreme Court, legal education, and in many parts of
                    the new Russian society.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point, when the rivalry between Yeltsin and
                        Gorbachev was becoming more and more apparent, there were attempts to
                        downplay Yeltsin. We put our money on Gorbachev, so Yeltsin was sort of
                        portrayed as a drunken clown, sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, he was, sometimes hopelessly drunk, but he was also the leader of
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But during sort of the period when he was not quite there
                        and all, did you sense within our own government a concern or an attempt to
                        put all their money onto Gorbachev and not onto Yeltsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I think they would have preferred Gorbachev, as he was more coherent
                    and predictable, they liked Gorbachev more. Clinton was fascinated by Yeltsin.
                    It seems he couldn't get enough of this phenomenal man. And, of course,
                    Gorbachev was gone as a leader when Clinton came to power, so they didn't have a
                    chance to share that direct chemistry of power that Clinton understands almost
                    better than anyone else I've ever seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about during the Bush administration and Baker and
                        all. From your observation, how did you find that chemistry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Baker was very helpful. Baker, when he was secretary of state, came to an
                    American Committee dinner to honor George Kennan. Baker's daughter worked for me
                    at the committee as my assistant. He was very knowledgeable and Baker's interest
                    in Russian matters goes back to a time when he was a child. He told me this
                    anecdote: in Houston his tennis coach was a Russian immigrant. He first became
                    interested in Russia from the stories his tennis coach told him. Baker is a very
                    bright man, and he was very helpful to us at the time. His handling of the fast
                    changing situation was skillful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the viewpoint from the Moscow side that you were
                        seeing of the fall and all, the Berlin wall in '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>MILLER: The fall of the Berlin Wall cannot be understood by itself. The impact of
                    the 1968 Prague uprising on Gorbachev, the power of the human rights movement
                    and the example of people liked Andrei Sakharov, and Havel, the Solidarity
                    Movement under Lech Walesa all contributed to the eventual fall of the Berlin
                    Wall. But most important was Gorbachev's decision that people of each nation
                    will make their own decision about the government they want to have. Self
                    determination is a view that he came to in 1968 in the Prague uprising. Some of
                    his close friends were Czechs. Gorbachev had deep sympathy for Dubcek, and some
                    admiration for Vaclav Havel. Some excellent histories have been written about
                    the fall of the Berlin Wall, including film documentaries that show that the key
                    decision was Gorbachev's. I would say further, that an important influence upon
                    Gorbachev was that of Sakharov who said to Gorbachev, “The republics should make
                    their own choices.”</p>
                <p>At the same time, Yeltsin was saying, “Russia has got enough to do to sort itself
                    out,” Russia meaning greater Russia, and he said further that these people in
                    the East, “they're not a threat, the West is not a threat. We don't need to have
                    a German dependencit's too much. We have enough of our own to do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Baltic republics? It seems that Gorbachev
                        sort of had a hope to keep them within thwhich sounds about as far out as
                        you can come, because they never really were a part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: If Russification had continued for another generation or so, the three
                    Baltic city-states would have been Russified. The current ethnic situation in
                    Lithuania gives some idea of what the policy of Russification was intended to
                    achieve.</p>
                <p>I think Gorbachev's view was that the Soviet Union was still a good idea, and
                    with reform everybody would be happy, there wouldn't be repression and everyone
                    could prosper. Yeltsin's view was somewhat different. His view was we'll
                    probably be together at some later point, but not now, we've got enough to do
                    separately, Yeltsin wasn't very worried about the future, his concerns were
                    getting from one day to the next.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it as a practical point of view, some sort of
                        economic union, close union, probably makes more sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>MILLER: A good friend of mine is an Estonian. Igor Grazin was in the Supreme
                    Soviet, the last two Supreme Soviets. He experienced the Prague uprisinhe was
                    there. Grazin is a distinguished lawyer, international lawyer. When I first met
                    him Grazin lived with his wife and son in a remarkable commune, you might say,
                    of Soviet legislators who were elected from the regions outside of Moscow. Many
                    of the deputies lived together, dangerous, in a modern apartment complex in a
                    suburb called Krylatsky in the outskirts of Moscow, a lovely part of Moscow.
                    Krylatsky is in an area of parks. We used to go cross-country skiing there in
                    the winter. Grazin lived out there with all these Supreme Soviet deputies and
                    their families. Their children went to school together. The deputies often ate
                    meals together and the political issues of the Supreme Soviet were carried on
                    into the night in Krylatsky. A substantial number of the Interregional group
                    lived in Krylatsky.</p>
                <p>Igor Grazin became a major figure in the last Soviet legislature. Grazin is a
                    pure Estonian, but he believes, even though he is a capitalist, that the
                    survival of the Soviet Union would have been a better result. He later went to
                    Notre Dame as a professor and taught these heretical ideas. As an Estonian
                    politician he's against entering the EU (European Union) because he believes it
                    would be prejudicial to the best interests of the Baltic states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, Bill, it's probably a good place to stop. And
                        we might pick this up, unless there's something else you want to mention
                        during this time. I'm sure there was so much going on that I hope you'll be
                        able to take a look and add. But we might pick this up in, what, '92 or '93,
                        when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think '91 is probably a good time. Ninety-one is the end of the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we talk about '91 and the end of the
                        Soviet Union and continue from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Okay, today is the 5th of July, 2004. Bill, back to 1991. As you watched this,
                    can you tell the events that unfolded, all of a sudden the dissolution of the
                    Soviet empire?</p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Sakharov had died in 1989 and the moral compass and the intellectual
                    basis for a continued Soviet Union was lost at that point. The possibilities of
                    working out a new democratic rationale for the Soviet Union was lost with the
                    death of Sakharov. Sakharov was the only one who could have crafted a new viable
                    confederation, a looser democratic arrangement of states within the territorial
                    framework of the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would Sakharov? He was a nuclear physicist and all of
                        that. When you think about all these nationalists running around from the
                        Ukraine and from the 'stans and all of that, and particularly when you think
                        about the Baltic states, Sakharov may have been an important figure, but
                        ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the debate at that time centered on the issues of whether it was
                    possible to have a confederation on new principles, principles of democracy,
                    human rights, decent civic and civil behavior. I would say up until the time of
                    his death, certainly, the debate was running in favor of a loose confederation.
                    I say this because the issue of constitutions, the war of laws, as it was then
                    called, were in structural terms that focused on this issue in 1989 and 1990.
                    And the place in which this crucial structural battle was being waged was the
                    Supreme Soviet, the last two Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union, which were
                    extraordinary in their character because of the quality of the people who had
                    been elected to serve there. They were the best from all of the regions of the
                    former Soviet Union, from Russia, Ukraine and the other republics and regions.
                    They were heavily peopled by the intelligentsia, of course, most of whom were
                    democrats. It was the most distinguished group of Russian figures and Soviet
                    figures that had ever been assembled in a Supreme Soviet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused this? You had had these guys with the steel
                        teeth and these apparatchiks who had controlled everything. How did they get
                        bypassed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We've already forgotten how powerful the reform movement was. It was a
                    brief period of two years when this remarkable group of Russians were looking at
                    the possibilities of a great new future. After all, the Soviet Union was a
                    country that was founded on dreams, dreams that were almost never realized, of
                    course. These dreams and hopes perhaps were never intended by the Stalinists and
                    the leaders of the Communist Party to be anything ore than temporary illusions.
                    But in those years, there were dreams and hopes that seemed to have meaning and
                    possibility. People were coming to Moscow from all over the Warsaw Pact region.
                    I can remember very well Dubcek coming to Moscow, meeting with the Sakharovs,
                    and I recall their discussions about what the new order could be for the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>The whole idea of self determination, which was implicit, didn't exclude being
                    sovereign, but within a changed Soviet Unioa democratic Soviet Union. It was a
                    very real hopthat is, the possibility of a democratic Soviet Union. The chance
                    for a democratic Soviet Union is challenged by the drive to create an
                    independent Russia. Yeltsin, as you remember, championed the independence
                    movement of Russia. His motivations I would say were primarily personal. Yeltsin
                    wanted to break the power of Gorbachev, his sworn enemy. I don't think it was
                    the highest of motives. At the same time, many members of the Supreme Soviet
                    were also elected to the Russian Parliament, so they served, for a time, in the
                    legislature in both places. In the opinion of most political observers of the
                    time, the very best, the most talented were those who decided to stay with the
                    Soviet Union. I thought so too. They said our highest duty is with the Soviet
                    Union. We can't serve two masters and it doesn't make any sense.</p>
                <p>It was very clear at the time, that the quality of the people in Supreme Soviet,
                    the last Supreme Soviet, was far higher than those who made up the new Russian
                    Parliament. I knew many of the legislators who served in both, and I would say
                    the very best stayed, mistakenly, as it turned out, in the Supreme Soviet.</p>
                <p>That crucial period in Moscow was extraordinarily hopeful from the point of view
                    of the possibilities of constructing a new Europe, a new world after the failed
                    experiment of the Communist Party. Russia lost its direction when it lost
                    Sakharov. I can't emphasize how important he was. He was able to lead and have
                    effect on people like Havel in Prague, or Lech Walesa in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, yes, and within the Soviet states. I would say once the Sakharov's
                    moral and intellectual leadership was gone and there was a divided struggle for
                    power between Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the impetus for self determination,
                    independent states, gained sway, and that was really the end. The coup attempt
                    was very symptomatic. The coup was the last gasp, a last-ditch effort by a
                    military coup, by those who wanted t keep the Soviet Union together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your organization and you see, first place,
                        developments prior to the coup? Was this euphoric, more or less, or were you
                        doing anything, passing on information?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>MILLER: We were just as active after the coup as before in working in the
                    parliaments of both of these structures, and in the new ministries of Russia,
                    particularly the Ministry of Justice, while at the same time the existing Soviet
                    structures were in place. There was a kind of joint responsibility of many of
                    those who were Russian and those from outside who were really helping both
                    places, because it was all seen at that time as useful. But, certainly, there
                    was an overall sense of waiting, waiting for the decision. There was a peculiar
                    sense of stasis even in the midst of dynamic change. Many efforts were made to
                    bridge the gap between Gorbachev and Yeltsin in the last year, but after the
                    August failed coup Yeltsin had the upper hand and he used his advantage to
                    destroy Gorbachev's power.</p>
                <p>Gorbachev knew that a coup was being considered and he may have been complicit,
                    even if he was not directly involved in the actual carrying out of the attempted
                    takeover. The Politburo had fractured, obviously, with the creation of Russia
                    earlier in the year, and all that were left in the Soviet leadership structure
                    were second-raters, but they were certainly controllable by Gorbachev, even in
                    the diminished circumstances. I think the coup, which Shevardnadze warned about
                    very clearlhe said, “They're coming.” was not a surprise to Gorbachev.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He resigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Shevardnadze resigned over the issue after he warned about the
                    possibility. I think Gorbachev knew. There was a lot of evidence pointing to
                    that, and had the coup been successful in removing Yeltsin from the scene,
                    Gorbachev would have acted in a very forceful way in moving in the direction of
                    a loose federation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting rumors of coups and all? I mean, was this
                        something that was sort of in the air in Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, yes, it was certainly in the air. The talk about possible coups were
                    everywhere. One forgets how porous and open everything was in Moscow. There were
                    no secrets, because these were issues that the public had to determine and not
                    just the Politburo members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time, or was there a movement
                        afoot, to bring back the equivalent of Stalinism? In other words, the iron
                        fist was going to take over again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, no, the most extreme headline elements, those who advocated force to
                    the greatest degree, were reflected in Yegor Ligachev, who was head of the
                    security forces, the KGB. Ligachev had already ideologically, as he expressed in
                    the previous party congresses of the previous several years, moved in the
                    direction of rule of larule of law, rigorously applied, and national security,
                    put it that way.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>The security forces were deeply involved in this debate. General Yazov, for
                    example, the chief of staff, who I had met on a number of occasions assisted me
                    to undertake a trip that to Nagorno-Karabakh. Yazov was instrumental in
                    providing logistical support for a group from the Sakharov Human Rights
                    Committee and the International Foundation to go to Nagorno-Karabakh and to
                    Azerbaijan to look into the condition of prisoners from both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Armenian ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Armenian-Azerbaijanian conflict.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... problem, which had predated the independence of these
                        countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's right, the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict had been, in part,
                    fomented by the disintegrating situation of the Soviet Union. Yazov was very
                    loquacious, extremely decorous and polite to our group, particularly to Yelena
                    Bonner, which astonished me, because she was not decorous or polite to him in
                    any way. This was an extraordinary business meeting in the Ministry of Defense,
                    but Yazov's discussions of the future of the Soviet Union and the dire straights
                    that the country was in. The conversation was very direct and to the point. This
                    was a group of people Yazov was not accustomed to having discussions with, a
                    delegation of foreigners and human rights activists. It also included some
                    important people in the new Russia who were emerging, as well as the leader of
                    the last Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The leadership group at the end of the Soviet Union and the beginnings of Russia
                    was so broad and so reflective of the south as a whole that it succeeded in
                    breaking down all the old preconceptions. I'm stressing the importance of this
                    time because of the, I won't say amorphous, but the very malleable moment that
                    it was. Moscow and Russia could have gone in any number of directions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the intellectuals sort of grab hold of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they fit into this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, they talked a lot, of course. They talked, and talked, often
                    brilliantly. When they wrote, there was a resulting great explosion of
                    newspapers, great exposure of new ideas in new forms of television commentary.
                    There was also an enormous amount of tract writing, of handbills, these
                    handbills and essays that were widely distributed in the parliaments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost an offshoot from the old Samizdat, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: With a public kind of Samizdat. That sounds contradictory. There was so
                    much to read that people were exhausted by the end of the day from reading about
                    what allegedly was happening and what it all meant, even though the readers were
                    part of what was happening and many readers were writing these very same things
                    they were reading about. It was an extraordinary time, and it was extraordinary
                    to be in the middle of it. The reason I was able to be in the middle of it was
                    certainly the support of people like Sakharov and his group, I also had an
                    instinct, an empathy for what was going on.</p>
                <p>My Russian and Soviet colleagues looked on Americans like me and my fellow board
                    members on the International Foundation as part of what they were undergoing,
                    and not as the cause. They didn't look on the United States as a potential
                    occupier, as a threat. They saw the United States as a source of a model for
                    future governance and as a help for their new construction of a decent
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our history of federal government and all was considered
                        kind of a model.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it was the historical model that was foremost in their minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your group, was there a state of mind for you all? The
                        committee was called what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, during the early years of perestroika, the American Committee on
                    U.S.-Soviet Relations, was the focal point for our activities, but the
                    institutional focus at that point was the International Foundation for the
                    Survival and Development of Humanity. This was the group, you recall, that
                    Gorbachev took under his wing, you might say, as a sounding board for the major
                    ideas that were underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize, was there a state of mind either
                        of wanting to keep the whole sort of Soviet Union somehow together, or at
                        least mostly together, maybe with the Baltics being somewhere to one side,
                        that this would be best rather than to see it splintering?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. I would say the state of mind of most official Americans was that it
                    would be better to keep the Soviet Union together. That was the official
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was a Yugoslav hand at one point and I know my

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Were of that view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were of that view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: And that was the presidential view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was wondering, how abouyou were outside, you really
                        weren't a Soviet hand, you weren't part of this mindset. How did you all
                        feel, or you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was deeply influenced by the people who were in the midst of the
                    ferment. I was reflecting here, thinking about how influenced I was by their
                    thinking and actions. As I indicated a few minutes ago, I thought the very best
                    of the legislators in Moscow were those who wanted to keep the Soviet Union
                    together, and who saw some merit in the Gorbachevian idea that a reformed Soviet
                    Union was possible, and that they, being decent democrats, could carry it out.
                    For them, a reformed democratic Soviet Union was far preferable to the model
                    that was being proposed by Yeltsin and Yeltsin's people, who they looked on as
                    self seeking opportunists. It was very much the view of the intelligentsia at
                    the time, that most of the Yeltsin people, were second rate. I think that was
                    the view of the embassy, too at that moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm asking about various groups. What about the students?
                        Were the students and faculty engaged in this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, they were. The faculties, certainly, the most distinguished among
                    the faculties, were in the parliaments. The composition of those last several
                    parliaments was absolutely remarkable, and a really good history of the time
                    would focus, on these figures who were in the last Supreme Soviets of the Soviet
                    Union and the first two parliaments of the independent states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with this set, from your perspective, what
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>MILLER: Gorbachev was cut to pieces by Yeltsin, particularly after Shevardnadze's
                    departure. He lost his majority in the ruling group, the Soviet ruling group,
                    and what was left was the Gorbachevian rump. The coup plotters group was
                    reflective of the greatly diminished quality. It just wasn't any good. He had
                    lost the leadership role and he didn't convert the disintegration of the
                    Politburo and the Central Committee into a majority group in the legislature,
                    which was where the leadership was. Political leadership had gone from the party
                    to the legislature. This was the great change in the Soviet structure of the
                    last several years of perestroika.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the party was where you thought the cream of the crop
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It wasn't the party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, it was the Supreme Soviet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was the Supreme Soviet. The Party, the Communist Partthe Party of
                    Power - had disintegrated. The party, as an instrument of power, had
                    disintegrated. The party as a reflection of intellectual allegiances remained,
                    but it was now in splinters, it no longer was the identity to the state. The
                    party was the state up until 1989. After the collapse of the single party in the
                    last congress of the party in 1988, it was no longer the main structural
                    instrument of governance. It wasn't the state any longer, so the state was
                    somewhere out there, but the legislature was from where legitimate leadership
                    and policy direction would come.</p>
                <p>Here, again, I go back to the huge mistake that Gorbachev made, which was not to
                    run for president and to receive legitimacy by being elected by the people.
                    Sakharov and others pled with him, “Run, get the new legitimacy necessary.” He
                    refused to do it, and some people think because he was afraid he might lose. It
                    is the view of almost all that he wouldn't have lost, he would have won by 80 or
                    90 percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been between him and Yeltsin. Was that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, but he would have won easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, did Yeltsin have the following, or was he
                        considered still ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was considered quite an erratic character, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. But Yeltsin's popularity came from the reform work that he did as
                    mayor of Moscow and the support that he had from the Interregional Group. The
                    Interregional Group was the place where political opinion and popular support
                    was molded at that time. It was a very short period of a year or so. Gorbachev's
                    refusal to acquire this legitimacy by election as president marked the end of
                    his leadership, in the view of many. I subscribe to that. He just couldn't put

                    electoral support of the group that was running the country in the legislatures
                    and not just party leadership. It just had never happened in the 1970s or 1980s
                    when the Party and the State were an identity. Gorbachev couldn't grasp the full
                    extent of the loss of power by the Parteven though he was the catalyst for that
                    loss of singular powers by declaring that pluralism was permitted..</p>

                        end. But prior to that, it hadn't happened and he wasn't tarred with that

                <p>MILLER: No. No, because Gorbachev still had the remnants of the power in his

                    it together again. But the coup of August 21st was ...</p>

                <p>MILLER: Ninety-one, yewas the last desperate effort to hold it together. The coup
                    was a crude device carried out by primitives and incompetents, as we saw. It
                    ended disastrously, in such humiliation for Gorbachev. I witnessed the public
                    humiliation when he came back from Foros in Crimea. I was in the Great Hall in
                    the Kremlin, in the assembly, and it was horrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it was the coronation, really, of Yeltsin, and a symbolic transfer
                    of power. Yeltsin treated him very much in a way of a Roman emperor treating a
                    king that had been defeated by the legions. It was symbolic, it was powerfully
                    conveyed, on television and throughout the world. Psychologically the death blow
                    was administered. One could see it, and everyone was affected. That was the
                    decisive moment, when Gorbachev came back. After that, independence declared
                    first by Russia in June and by Ukraine in August, was ratified Christmas day of
                    1991.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>So I was a witness to these events. I'm sure some of the officers in the embassy
                    were witnesses, but perhaps not in the same way. I'm certain that the collapse
                    of the Soviet Union was an action brought about by the people of the Soviet
                    Union; it was not significantly affected by outside forces.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's right, less significant is more accurate. The long standing
                    desire of the Baltics to be independent was understood. The ability of the
                    Soviet system to keep them inside was also understood, that they had the ability
                    to do that. Whether they would permit them to go their own way really depended
                    on everything else. This issue is something that I know about from the
                    legislators from the three states, city-states that were in the last Supreme
                    Soviets, who I knew really well.</p>
                <p>The leaders in the Baltic states faced the same dilemma as those from Russia and
                    the core republics of the Soviet Union in the last Supreme Soviets as to whether
                    there could be a reformed Soviet Union. The Baltic leaders could see the
                    possibility of ethnic or even national separate or autonomous identity within a
                    reformed democratic Soviet Union. That was the debate, and it was still in 1990
                    a live issue. What had to go was the Stalinist experience and all the excesses
                    of the previous 70 years.</p>
                <p>Yeltsin had the clearest view, the simplest view, in a way, the primitive view,
                    which was Russia by itself was big enough, and the problems of Russia were
                    enough to focus on. The other republics, states, and regions could go and we'll
                    bring them back later.</p>

                        economic system, and all of a sudden you start going your own way, you've
                        got tremendous dislocations.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape eight, side one, with Bill Miller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: One of the features of the Soviet Union, as you've alluded, was its
                    diversified economic structure. For example, there were the assembly plants in
                    Kazakhstan for helicopters using parts made in Magnetogorsk or in Odessa and
                    they'd be transported over and assembled in a remote part of Kazakhstan. This
                    was not the most cost effective way of developing an economy. Certainly, the
                    intention was to pull the vast areas of the Soviet Union together by having
                    economic activity throughout, and that they would therefore, be interdependent
                    and, therefore, dependent on the Soviet structure. The Gosplanners (Soviet
                    central planners) believed that Russia had all of the internal resources needed
                    to build anything needed by a modern state, which indeed it did, and that the
                    Soviet Union was large enough to have an indigenous circle of production that
                    would be self sustaining.</p>
                <p>The idea of profitability, of course, wasn't a major concern. Certainly, the
                    Soviet planners had a kind of market in mind. Their market was largely contained
                    within the Soviet space, and what they were working out in their own minds was
                    how to provide adequate goods to all of the population. And they really didn't
                    see any need for external markets. It was a closed system. But it was also a
                    substantial part of the world. They reasoned that a closed system could work,
                    and believed that to the end. I talked, indeed, about this to one of the last of
                    the Gosplan heads. He was a prime minister of the Republic of Ukraine before
                    independence, briefly, Masol, a very intelligent, well-trained Soviet economist.
                    He made a very plausible case for the viability of the Soviet system within the
                    Soviet Union. And in my view it was a conceivably plausible case. It denied the
                    need for any foreign market, except for prestige purposes. To this day, I'm
                    sure, he is of that view.</p>
                <p>Russia and all of its independent states found themselves with this inherited
                    economic base that had been interdependent in the past. Much of the politics and
                    foreign policy of the last dozen years from 1991 on is an attempt to form a
                    viable CIS, a community of independent states, which is a reformation in an
                    economic sense of the former Soviet Union, in order to take advantage of the
                    existing base.</p>
                <p>Actually, the industrial base that had been created in Soviet times in large
                    measure is now obsolete. The industries, as we have found, are now rust belt,
                    and a lot of them environmentally dangerous and should be dismantled or rebuilt.
                    The new age of service industry and information technology has changed almost
                    everything. In Russia, they're going back to the most primitive of economic
                    steps, which is creating capital by the sale of resources. That's the present
                    base of the Russian economy, oil and gas and metals.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's the Brzezinski thesis, and of course that's only partially true.
                    Russia alone, with thousands of nuclear weapons, is still a great threat.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Right, Russia still has large population resources as well as vast
                    natural resources. By itself it is a great nation and, in the future, if they
                    pull themselves together, will be even without Ukraine. But Brzezinski and
                    Kissinger agreed that with Ukraine, it's an empire. It is an arguable point of
                    view that has to be contended with.</p>
                <p>I knew most of the individuals in the Ukrainian delegation in the Supreme Soviet
                    in Moscow, but I didn't know them or look on them as Ukrainian nationalists, and
                    I don't think they looked on themselves initially as Ukrainian nationalists,
                    except for a few from the western part of Ukraine. Their view was, like that of
                    most of the Interregional Group; reform the Soviet Union. Once confidence in
                    Gorbachev's leadership declined and the Yeltsin approach took hold, the
                    Ukrainian delegation went in the direction of independence for Ukraine.</p>
                <p>A good part of the Soviet leadership was Ukrainian. Forty percent of the military
                    general staff were Ukrainian. Forty percent is a good number to use in the
                    political leadership, too, because at times it was as high as 40 percent
                    Ukrainian, looking at the Khrushchev and Brezhnev tenures.</p>

                    including myself, was as part of Russia. As one of my very good Russian friends
                    once said about the newly independent Ukraine, “It was inconceivable that there
                    could be a Russia without Ukraine and Crimea and southern Ukraine, where
                    Tchaikovsky and so many of my relatives, used to spend summers. This was a part
                    of Russian life. Pushkin went there, and Chekhov, all of our great Russians were
                    part Ukrainian. It was inconceivable that Ukraine and Russia should be
                    separated.”</p>

                <p>MILLER: It was part of the Captive Nations anti communist, anti Soviet Union

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, I think it was an �migr� movement. The �migr�s from the captive
                    nations were often led by intellectuals, they believed very fiercely that their
                    ethnic groups had been persecuted and that they had been forced out of their
                    homeland. They always wanted to return one day. The Ukrainian �migr�s who were
                    most active in the Captive Nations Movement were from western Ukraine, but not
                    entirely. It was an intellectual movement. They had influence in Congress,
                    certainly in the context of the Cold War, it was a useful policy instrument, and
                    it was used as such. I don't think it was ever seen as an alternative to the
                    Soviet Union. While it was always a hope, I don't think anyone in the policy
                    world foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union. Some parts of our government
                    used the �migr� movements as a way of undermining the Soviet Union. Attempts
                    were made, as you know, in the '20s and '30s that were dismal failures, and
                    there were rollback operations in 1950 which were also disastrous failures. I
                    personally learned a lot about Ukrainian history from the individual experiences
                    of the �migr� groups here, after I was nominated.</p>

                        which had obviously gotten more from the Soviet Union than they'd given to
                        the Soviet Union, and there must have been others that really were very
                        reluctant to get involved in the splitting up. Was this happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>MILLER: It was happening, but my knowledge and understanding of the “stans” was
                    through human rights groups. There were many human rights issues to be concerned
                    about. The nuclear scientists, who were friends and associates of Sakharov and
                    his group, were of the opinion that the nuclear testing sites which were in
                    Kazakhstan were environmentally dangerous and were of great concern worldwide,
                    but particularly to the people Kazakhstan. I had met a number of intellectuals
                    and poets from Kazakhstan that were in the last Supreme Soviet. They were making
                    the case for the removal of the dangerous nuclear weapons and nuclear waste and
                    a halt to the repression and intolerance of native peoples. This kind of concern
                    was evident in all of the ethnic and national groups throughout the Soviet
                    Union, so there was nothing distinctive about that.</p>
                <p>I learned much about Tajikistan, because, of course, I speak Persian. Tajik and
                    Persian are very similar. I found them a rather dramatic people. Their leaders
                    included filmmakers and other intellectuals and scientists who were very active
                    in Moscow and made the case for the plight of the Tajiks and brought attention
                    to their quarrels with Uzbeks. The driving issues seemed to be over tribal
                    control rather than ideological, in many respects.</p>
                <p>While I was generally aware of what was going on throughout the Soviet Union,
                    because of my knowledge of what was going in the parliament and in the circles
                    of intellectuals, my real focus was the ferment in Moscow.</p>

                    him a number of times. Like Gorbachev, he was interested in what was a common
                    agenda and valuable and wanted to participate. Yeltsin's manner was very much
                    more Soviet than Gorbachev. It was clear that Yeltsin was the first secretary
                    and you had meetings with him because he allowed it to happen. He followed a
                    prepared agenda and after he discussed it. said, “Yes, we'll do that.” He was
                    constructive and helpful, but I won't say he was engaged in the process as
                    Gorbachev was.</p>
                <p>Yeltsin was helpful and accessible because he respected Sakharov and a number of
                    the people who worked with Sakharov, who we had brought to the United States,
                    who were in key positions, for example, his minister of justice, and his chief
                    of staff, who were both good friends of mine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But with the death of Gorbachev in '89 and moving up
                        through '91, did that change that relationship? I mean, your group and
                        Yeltsin?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>MILLER: The nature of the issues, certainly the major issues, the political
                    issues, changed completely. The end of the Soviet Union had been decided. I'll
                    give you one example of the interim period. We brought over a delegation from
                    the United States that was led by Muskie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Edmund Muskie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. It was a distinguished group of people, sponsored by both the
                    American Committee and the International Foundation. We had a session with
                    Yeltsin. The main issue was Russia or the Soviet Uniowhich was the better
                    outcome? Muskie forcefully maintained that the Soviet Union should be kept
                    together. As Muskie was saying this to Yeltsin, Yeltsin in no uncertain terms
                    shouted, “It's not going to happen.” The Soviet Union is not going to exist any
                    longer. It's now Russia. And Muskie answered, insisting that for the good of the
                    world the Soviet Union must stay together. Of course, then, my Russian friends,
                    Yeltsin's chief aides, who were there were shaking their heads, saying, “Don't
                    you Americans understand it's already happened?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself seeing that the Soviet Union was
                        over while the embassy didn't? I mean, was there a time when things like
                        Muskie receiveI mean, really, you were beginning to see things from a
                        different viewpoint.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think the American embassy was seeing the reality that the Soviet Union
                    was over pretty well. They had a large well-staffed embassy with a good
                    political section. The political section was split in their views about the
                    future direction of the Soviet Union or Russia. Many of the ambassadors from
                    throughout the world assigned to Moscow were aware of all of the turmoil going
                    on. Indeed, it was difficult to avoid living the life of most Muscovites. If
                    they reported, as I know they did, on just what they themselves were doing, it
                    was a pretty good parallel picture of what was going on in the minds and daily
                    lives of many Russians.</p>
                <p>The radical changes happening to Russia were affecting the working method of the
                    embassies. The American embassy, indeed, almost all embassies and its methods
                    and its utility as an instrument of foreign policy had to change, because the
                    country had changed so rapidly from the police state and a situation where the
                    embassy was isolated and forced into as small and tight a box as possible.
                    During perestroika the embassy was being asked to help put together a new
                    state.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>How do you report all these tumultuous events in some effective way that can help
                    policymakers? That became the task. I don't know the full answers. The Moscow
                    Embassy was challenged, they were confronted with the great change of no longer
                    being a reporting outpost; rather they were in the middle of consequential
                    change and an actor in it. The Embassy had to open up and it was very difficult
                    to do because it had been structured in another way for a very different set or
                    circumstances. A lot of the officers of that time, the junior officers in the
                    political section in Moscow and on the desk in Washington, throughout the think
                    tanks, a lot of them left the Department after that time. But for me, Dick Miles
                    and Jim Collins were people I saw frequently, and, of course, the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>All of the embassies of the West had to transform themselves. It was impressive
                    and encouraging to see how ambassadors became street people. That's what was
                    needed. You had to be on the street, to know what was going on. This was no
                    longer a cocktail circuit or exchange of information among colleagues. The
                    ambassadors went into the parliaments and were doing what the journalists were
                    doing. Of course, this was the period of extraordinarily good journalism,
                    American journalism, with David Remnick, Rick Smith and Bill Keller, Robert
                    Kaiser and Phil Taubman. There were at least a dozen great writers among the
                    press corps.</p>
                <p>The political reporting from the Embassy at the time, was just as good, if not
                    better. Very few outside the Department of State would know that. “What do you
                    tell Washington? How do you tell Washington something that they can't read in
                    the newspaper? How do you reshape this very important outpost, which is now not
                    an outpost, not a bastion, either, but rather a center of the West in the heart
                    of the East, undergoing change? How do you make it useful?”</p>
                <p>I'd say that so many other instruments and means and influences were at play now.
                    The businessmen were in large numbers, the American businessmen, the groups like
                    ours, the journalists, many of the civil society organizations, religious
                    groups. Moscow was a wide-open place. Diplomats had to adapt to these new
                    circumstances almost instantly, and if they didn't adapt, they weren't
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find what I think would be quite natural, a
                        certain unhappiness on the part of many Russians/Soviets about all these
                        do-gooders who were coming from the West telling them how to run their
                        business and all that. I think there would be too many Westerners running
                        around full of advice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: At the end, certainly. At the end, certainly. But in the heat of battle,
                    the Russians just picked and chose. They picked who they wanted, used who they
                    thought were helpful, talked to those they found reason to do so for pleasure or
                    solace or utility, depending on motivation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there were two revolutions going on, I would think.
                        One would be on the political side, who does what to whom and who is in
                        charge? But the other one is there is an economic system which is in a way
                        far more important to the person in the street, of how do they make their
                        living? What was happening sort of on the economic side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, you use the right term, person on the street. Many ordinary
                    citizens went in the street personally, as individuals, and sold personal
                    belongings because they had to in order to survive. A basic sufficiency economy
                    quickly developed. The sufficiency economy was just that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By sufficiency economy, at the bare level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Subsistence, being able to live on despite the collapse of an economic
                    system, with the collapse of monethat is, the ruble, or the Soviet rubland
                    having no significant exports or imports, how did they survive? Well, the people
                    who had to went on the street and they sold their less-needed belongings for
                    food, for vegetables, which were brought in from the plots around Moscow or the
                    other cities, and somehow they managed to survive. They developed an economy
                    based on their needs, not a bad beginning for a new society. It was humiliating
                    for many. At almost every metro stop, there'd be several hundred babushkas
                    holding up a sausage or a pair of shoes, some treasured book or piece of
                    clothing. It was a barter economy. “You can buy from me what you need or think
                    you need, and I'll buy from you. We'll exchange our belongings.”</p>
                <p>It was also a process of democratization, and certainly an equalization. At that
                    level no one prospered; at that level, everyone survived. This is the time when
                    state stores, the produkti, the place where staples, vegetables, ovashi
                    (vegetables) and frukti (fruit) were sold, had nothing on their shelves.
                    Everything was in the street, so the state instrument disappeared and the
                    replacement was the people's instrument, and it wasn't bad. For all of the
                    direct face-to-face humiliation for many people, well-dressed academicians who
                    were selling their goods to get basic food and vegetables to survive, it was a
                    leveling process. Every family that could went out to country places and planted
                    potatoes and cabbages and other basics in order to get through the hard
                    winter.</p>
                <p>So that was the beginning of the new economy. It was first a subsistence economy,
                    and it was a very strong start to a new sound economy, I would say, because the
                    Russians and the Ukrainians, (because it was still going on in Ukraine when I
                    went to Kyiv in 1993 as ambassador), were proud of being able to do this. They
                    survived by their own efforts, and no one stopped them. They had to do it. They
                    despised the state whose failure had forced them to do it, but the people did
                    it. It was self reliance of an important kind.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Then, shortly thereafter the shadow economy arose out of the dark corners of
                    economic life. The shadow economy in the first stages was mostly luxury goodit
                    was alcohol and cigarettes and luxury underwear, things of that sort. The shadow
                    economy was also the beginning of economic criminalitthe kiosk culture, the
                    mafia arrangements, none of this was taxed, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left before they sort of gave up the big enterprises
                        and those each were taken over by many of these, call them robber

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I left Moscow, but, of course, I went immediately thereafter to
                    Ukraine as ambassador, where that process ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick this up then, but there must have been certain
                        elements of the populous, and I would think it would fall hardest on the
                        intellectuals and all, but inability to live within thiit's hard for a
                        professor to get out and peddle books and all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, well, this is what is attractive about Russia at this time of
                    difficulty to many, certainly to me, is that these are people who made it
                    through these terrible things that occurred to almost every generation. You
                    think of 1917 and then of the purges in the '30s, then of the Second World War,
                    not to mention the civil wars throughout the Soviet Union, but how they survived
                    and made their way and somehow maintained a civilized approach to life. You have
                    to admire their toughness and fortitude and human greatness of character.</p>
                <p>The intellectuals were the people that I knew best, and many are still my
                    friends. Their sons were selling bananas on the corner and supporting the
                    family. They were earning more or less what they earned under the Soviet system,
                    which under the present conditions was very little, and they had no perks
                    anymore, but they had their apartments. They were surviving. They had no money
                    for research or their activities. Yet everyone was involved in building the new
                    state, what it was becoming. Many former top Soviets and bureaucrats and
                    academics were active politically, but even if they weren't, they were affected
                    by the politics of change.</p>
                <p>Yes, I would say the change fell hardest on those who had fixed, assured
                    positions, or niches, in the old Soviet society, even the best academicians,
                    people in the institutes, even the opera, ballet, state-supported institutions,
                    hospitals, schools. It fell hardest on those parts of the Soviet system which
                    were part of the basic national infrastructure and would be necessary social
                    infrastructure under any system, including the most advanced capitalist system.
                    The fact that all of these structures, the universities, schools, hospitals, the
                    arts, somehow survived is partially due to the great character of these people,
                    their unusual strength in conditions of the greatest adversity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there concern on your part and all about the
                        Soviet military? Because looking at it, being familiar with the American
                        military system, you had far too great an officer corps. What the hell do
                        you do with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, that was a daunting question they had to deal with. What was done
                    was to do nothing. They just left the military in place. They didn't disband
                    them, they just maintained them, and they kept the draft, of course. The draft
                    was the greatest threat to the military, because there was no need and the
                    hazing and mistreatment, traditional mistreatment, became an issue for the
                    mothers, and they were a powerful political group at that time. The few uses
                    that the military were ordered to do were terribly unpopular.</p>
                <p>The military command, having been a part of the political structure in the
                    Politburo and Central Committee, suddenly found themselves largely outside. They
                    were dispossessed and had to find a place in the new political structure because
                    of the collapse of the Party. And this is where the reformed secret police
                    become terribly important. To some extent there was a reformation in the secret
                    police. Putin was one example of what that reformation means. That is, they're
                    still the most powerful group remaining from the Soviet Union, because of their
                    coherent, informed (relatively) discipline. The primary motivations are still to
                    hold the state together, and to protect the state from enemies. They are still
                    an elite group, and still are able to generate enough fear for them to have an
                    effect. Maintaining a large military obviously began to be clearly unneeded with
                    the end of the Cold War. The issue of the relative size of the Russian military
                    has been largely resolved. They'll maintain a million-plus army including
                    reserves for the foreseeable future. They've reached an equilibrium on that
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Political allegiance? The military commanders are not going to go anywhere else,
                    to another state, and the Russian leadership from the beginning still had Soviet
                    attitudes about the military. Yeltsin, who was a lapsed Soviet, was still a
                    Soviet in character. Putin is certainly exhibits Soviet characteristics. The
                    security forces understand that they still command respect from the new
                    leadership, even though their role in the political system is much reduced.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Well, it did. It discredited those who went with the coup, but the
                    military forces stood in place and largely resisted following General Yazov. I
                    mean, the secret police, part of the KGB, told Yeltsin you have a way, with our
                    help.</p>

                <p>MILLER: They sided with the people. People were stuffing flowers down the gun
                    barrels. These were 18-year-old kids and their parents who were in front of the
                    gun barrels and tanks.</p>

                <p>MILLER: This is very interesting, because the heads of battalions that were
                    guarding Moscow at the time, this I recall, these guards who headed the major
                    tank divisions, were well known to the legislators. The legislators and
                    Yeltsin's group got to them. The overwhelming view that Yeltsin had a right to
                    govern was maintained and the experiment of an independent Russia was preferred,
                    in the absence of a coherent Soviet Union on the part of Gorbachev. He hadn't
                    presented a coherent alternative vision.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Well, I was receiving reports from the parliament. You remember they were
                    besieged, and the “White House” was communicating by telephone, almost minute to
                    minute to strategic places all over the world not to mention Moscow. I have
                    messages tucked away, files of those, mostly from Sergei Kovalev, who was
                    Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee. He and his office kept us
                    informed minute by minute of what was happening inside the besieged White
                    House.</p>

                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, yes. Susan, was also a board member, with the name of a very
                    distinguished American family, was a great help. She was very interested in what
                    was happening, learned much and was a positive force. She fell in love with a
                    fellow International Foundation board member, Roald Sagdeev, the head of the
                    Soviet space program. They carried on a romance in the middle of all of this and
                    got married. He came with her back to the United States. He's here at the
                    University of Maryland at this point. She was a good reporter to her circles of
                    friends about what was going on. She's a good friend of mine, very good

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, 1991. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: President Bush likes to use the phrase “the world has changed since
                    9/11,” but I think, in 1991, the world changed in ways that are much more
                    profound than 9/1certainly more constructive. 9/11 is tactical. The end of the
                    East-West confrontation, the end of the Soviet empire is strategic in the
                    deepest and broadest sense. 1991 was the last chance that those who had the
                    Soviet dream could have changed things internally enough to continue, and they
                    failed. Gorbachev failed. The whole structure that had been built up over 70
                    years imploded, because the populations of all of the republicthe main one, of
                    course, being Russia itselhad understood that the Soviet ideology and dream of a
                    Communist society and Socialist principles had failed.</p>
                <p>Certainly the leadership of the coup attempts proved the point, that the
                    Communist Party represented inept, substandard leadership and that it had no
                    capability, even negative capability, of undertaking the changes that were
                    necessary, as expressed by the overwhelming majority of the country. Gorbachev
                    rode this enormous tide of change as chairman of the Party, but the tide was too
                    much for the ship he was aboard and attempting to steer. To continue the
                    metaphor, the ship Gorbachev was attempting to steethe Soviet Party structure
                    was no longer where real power was.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>Some of the most interesting indicators of this shift of power, I think, include
                    the last several Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union, where you have the
                    membership, extraordinarily capable people that went far beyond the old Party of
                    Power, the Communist Party nomenklatura. The majority leadership was now with
                    the leaders of the nationalities, of literature, of the arts and scienceother
                    disciplines far beyond traditional Soviet politics. It was a very catholic,
                    extraordinary legislature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the changes after '91.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was speaking about the quality of the last legislatures of the Soviet
                    Union. We were talking about the legislatures, the quality of those who made up
                    the legislature of the last two Supreme Soviets. I was arguing that the true
                    leadership of Russia and those entities that made up the Soviet Union was no
                    longer in the Party of Power.</p>
                <p>A very good case in point is how the regions reactethat is, the republics. There
                    is an Estonian named Igor Grazin, who was one of the key members of the Estonian
                    delegation to the Supreme Soviet, the last two. He was half-Estonian, half
                    Russian, a personification of the Sovietization of the Baltic States. Grazin is
                    an extraordinary international lawyer, he was first in his class in several
                    universities and law school, including Moscow and ended up here, in the United
                    States as a professor at Notre Dame. He went back to Estonia as a legislator of
                    an independent republic. His position was similar to that of many Ukrainians and
                    certainly those of the Warsaw state members from Eastern Europe, that the
                    Gorbachevian approach of regional autonomy was the right one. That was their
                    view, and that was the view of the Bush administration. However, Gorbachev had
                    to go further beyond rhetoric in order to make it work, and that was to give
                    increasing autonomy to the new elements that were in the political equation. It
                    wasn't simply independence for nationalist tribes, but it was an inclusion of
                    intellectuals, of artists, of all of these people who had been kept out, and
                    they were now part of the equation, and they, in fact, were what were in the
                    last two Supreme Soviets. That was the new Soviet Union. The reality was
                    there.</p>
                <p>The leadership of the Soviet state structurthe bureaucracy, the apparatucould not
                    adjust to that new reality. They resisted the internal changes that were
                    necessary to conform to the new realities. The outcome of the clash between the
                    new reality and the old structure was that the new reality, being much larger
                    and more able, won the day.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The last several years of perestroika is an extraordinarily interesting period
                    that, I think, needs to be understood by those who are interested in the new
                    Russia. It is necessary to know the condition of the former Soviet Union at that
                    crossover point, and the issues that were at play. It is important to know what
                    the perestroika group represented and what independence of the nationalities or
                    the republics meant, what the ideological changes were, how they might have been
                    otherwise, had the Soviet state kept together. So 1991 was an extraordinarily
                    heady, yeasty, bubbling, kind of turbulent period. It was a real search for an
                    optimum solution in which there were society-wide struggles over the fundamental
                    law, many particular subsidiary laws, structures of government, including state
                    and local governments, cultural institutions and city governments. The intensity
                    of the society-wide participation in the creation of the new state was
                    remarkable and inspiring, to me as an American.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I was, a good deal of the time, up until 1993. In that period while
                    I was living there, and I was very closely involved with the key players in the
                    drama, from Gorbachev and Yeltsin to the leaders in the Supreme Soviet and
                    Moscow city government and even the clergy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It always struck me that one of the major problems with

                        happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. Survival was very much at stake for individuals. “How can we live?
                    How do we eat?” And because state storeall stores were state storeas the state
                    broke down, weren't supplying fundamental goods. So the shadow market, the
                    underground markets, that had always existed in the time of collective farms,
                    where the surpluses that were grown on homegrown in the home plots were brought
                    by peasants and the farm workers to the city and sold in the open markets and at
                    the entrances to metro stops, became the staples. The state stores had supplies
                    but the shelves were so bare they vanished.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They withered away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: They withered away. The state had withered away in the Marxist sense, and
                    what was left was a hand-to-mouth individualistic economy. That was the moment
                    of the real free-market economy, because it was person to person and the most
                    permitted form was barter, in order to survive. People from the villages and the
                    collective farms would bring produce and they would get shoes and clothing, and
                    those who were in severe difficulty would be selling off their shoes and
                    clothing in order to eat. Everyone had to survive, everyone, and that was a way
                    of investiture in the new state. They were on the street, bartering, outside the
                    metro stations in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>People at the higher levels of Soviet life even at the higher levels of the
                    bureaucracy were forced to do this like everyone else. It was a kind of
                    democratization. They said, “We've got to do something about this, we can'how
                    can we live like this?” which is the name of a very good perestroika film, by
                    the way. We Cannot Live Like This was the title of the film, and it had great
                    resonance among the people of the time. In fact this is a sidebabut the
                    perestroika films, as they were known then, of which there are abouI think I saw
                    30 or 40 of them. Remarkable in quality, they remind me of the Iranian films
                    that are being produced now. They were just so full of the immediate sense of
                    what the people were undergoing, their sense of reality. It was wonderfully
                    portrayed, usually with ironic humor, the Soviets at that point, and the new
                    Russians-to-be didn't have a stomach for the tough stuff. The Cold Summer of
                    1953 was as much as they could bear. They needed some humor in their existence,
                    and they got it, of course. By the time Burnt By the Sun appeared in 1994 a film
                    about the Purges that won the best foreign film Academy award and the Cannes
                    award, popular taste could no longer stomach such critiques of Soviet life. It
                    was a great day for the arts, a great time for the arts, particularly performing
                    arts. It was remarkable, it stimulated quality in not only the performance of
                    classical music and theater, but new music, including rock and popular music.
                    Vysotsky, who was the great singer of protest in Soviet times, sang in an argot
                    of prison slang. There were five or six very popular folk singers, sort of Joan
                    Baez guitar style but in the end Russian. I have a large collection of Melodya
                    recordings. I love the music from this time. It was remarkable, all of it.</p>
                <p>They had rock bands that had names like Black Coffee and Time Machine and all
                    manner of bizarre groups that were extraordinarily good. Many of them were sort
                    of take-offs on the Beatles. The closest to the Beatles was a group called
                    Quartet Sekret, the Secret Quartet, from St. Petersburg. They were very funny,
                    and somehow joyously light hearted, very good musicians. They were very popular
                    during the perestroika period.</p>
                <p>So it was a time of great possibility, openness and humanity. It was the fact
                    that the dissidents of the timnot initially refuseniks, but dissidents, like
                    Sakharov, the respect and position that was given to him and his group, whereas
                    in the past they were reviled and put in the gulag. It was a remarkable
                    transformation of character, national character, of free individual expression
                    and a wonderful atmosphere to live in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the KGB apparatus type, and I assume

                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the KGB as a repressive force had disintegrated, and they were
                    under very severe restraint and the units of the KGB that were known for their
                    brutality, and used force, were kept to insure the new idea of law and order.
                    The bugging of telephones, no one cared. No one was afraid. They would point the
                    ceiling they'd start cursing at the ceiling, and then go on, without any fear,
                    because many of them who in the past were the listeners or informers were part
                    of the new group. Getting rid of these symbols of soviet expression, pulling
                    down the Dzerzhinsky statue, and putting up a memorial to the gulagis instead
                    and right next door to the entrance to lyubyanka was a sign of how changed
                    things were. They pulled down the idols of the past and put them in Tretyakov
                    Park knowing that the statues in the future would be important museum pieces.
                    They didn't destroy them, they just put them aside.</p>
                <p>It was a remarkable, remarkable time of possibility, and the result, was a
                    peaceful process that was bloodless, for the most part. The transition to the
                    integration into the world economy and international structures has been
                    extraordinarily difficult because there was such a difference between the world
                    that the Soviets had constructed over 70 years and what had been happening in
                    the rest of the world, particularly in the West. The integration into radically
                    different systems has proven to be difficult, and unfortunately brutal,
                    criminal, inequitable, and largely unsuccessful. But as a huge national system,
                    as a continental system, Russia is taking its place as one of the G-8, simply
                    because of the size, not yet because of performance, but rather because of the
                    abundance of resources and its obvious economic potential. They can't be
                    ignored, even with all of their deficiencies. They're there. “Here we are, what
                    are you going to do with us?”</p>
                <p>So in those years, I was in Moscow and I was fortunate to be allowed to be a part
                    of their group, particularly by those who were working on the structure of the
                    new law, new systems of government and international issues. I was welcomed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were some of the key players on the Bush side and on
                        the Soviet side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>MILLER: The key players in the Yeltsin group, the new Russia; in St. Petersburg
                    it was Sobchak, and Putin was one of his lesser lieutenants. In Moscow, first it
                    was Yeltsin as mayor and he brought along his apparatus from Sverdlovsk and they
                    became the heads of the Moscow city council and the police force; these were
                    people we worked with. In the Supreme Soviet itself the speaker after following
                    Khasbulatov from Chechnya, was Konstantin Lubenchenko, who was one of those
                    first departees we brought to the United States on a visit to our Congress.
                    There was Andrei Sebentsov, who was chairman of the Constitutional Drafting
                    Committee and the Committee on Laws, that is, the vetting of legal writing.
                    Nikolai Fyodorov, from Chuvash, was the first Minister of Justice of Russia.
                    People like Igor Grazin, an Estonian, and Yuri Scherbak, from Ukraine, Andrei
                    Sakharov, who was a very close friend and his group, Sergei Kovalev, and there
                    were a whole group of lawyers who had been those who had defended the dissidents
                    in the hard times and had gone to the Parliament as legislators, they were a
                    very key group in the beginning. Many of them became judges in the
                    constitutional court and the Supreme Court, the key figures in legal education.
                    These were people like Galina Starovoitova, from St. Petersburg, who was
                    murdered some years ago, who was a human rights activist, and who was one of the
                    first to bring attention to what was happening in Nagorno Karabakh, and in
                    Chechnya.</p>
                <p>Then there were the orthodox priests, and the clerical hierarchy, metropolitan
                    Pitirim in Moscow, who was on the board of the International Foundation, and
                    Kyril, who is a possible successor, it is believed, to Patriarch of all Russia,
                    Alexei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the church responding, because it has
                        always been a creature of the state, or at least that's the common
                        perception.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Not for the babushka. The clergy was coopted by the KGB, or at least some
                    of it. The hierarchy made what they regarded as unavoidable accommodations in
                    order to survive. I went to Zagorsk a number of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Zagorsk being the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Zagorsk is where the main seminary for the Orthodox Church I located, the
                    monastery of the trinity. The monastery which dates from the fourteenth century.
                    One of the fortified monastery towns that made up the “Golden Ring”, was
                    officially a museum in the Soviet time, but it was, in fact, a center for the
                    deeply religious, as long as they were in conformity with the state, which
                    included, in many cases, active cooperation with the security force, with KGB.
                    In Soviet times coopted by the KGB didn't exclude the possibility of faith. That
                    was a remarkable reality that I found. The liturgy wasn't affected, and for the
                    Orthodox, as I've come to understand them, the liturgy is unchanging and was
                    unchanged. So if liturgy wasn't interfered with, the Soviets hadn't gotten to
                    the core of faith. The rest of it is human failing, but the purity of the
                    received church remained, is what the clergy maintains.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, all the churches, including the Catholics, were
                        going through profound changes and the Orthodox had fallen to the straight
                        line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: More or less. In all of the apparatus of the Orthodox churciconography,
                    certainly text and ceremony there is no change. In the babushka world, everyone
                    has a grandmother, the ritual, the unchanging ritual, sustained them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what the babushka is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Grandmothers. They were and are the keepers of memory, even in Soviet
                    times. They're the ones who see to the proper baptisms, the marriages, the
                    burials in the church. They are the ones who tell the stories of the ancestors,
                    including fairy tales of the past, and they went to the churches all through the
                    Soviet period. They were not a threat to the state and they were somehow able to
                    preserve the lineage of faith.</p>
                <p>The babushka phenomenon was strong enough, so that when controls were lifted, all
                    of society, the grandfathers and mothers and fathers and children all went to
                    church. Partially, I think, because it was and is an institution of great
                    beauty. I won't say entertainment, but entertainment was part of it. The music
                    had not been suppressed completely and the choral singing was of such high
                    quality that the churches were filleabsolutely filleall the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did thethere has to be a factory that produces these
                        Russians basses. Where do you get that deep, rumbling ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think it's a mixture of caviar, sausage and vodka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's just remarkable and wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I was very interested in Russian choral music, so I went to every church
                    that had a good choir and went to every concert that I could. That was one of
                    the joys of being in Moscow. It was such an open, expansive time that I never
                    felt any fear, I must say, during the time I lived in Moscow, anywhere in
                    Moscow. Everyone was on the street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about crime, though?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>MILLER: There were crimes of deprivation, but people helped each other out, so it
                    was less evident. The crimes of ththe economic crimes that were the large
                    thefts, the breaking in of automobiles and shops and so on, comes later, when
                    people became unequal in their wealth, but at this stage everyone was poor, and
                    everyone was sharing, to an extent, certainly within the families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet military? It always struck me that
                        they had, right from almost the beginning, a really flawed system. They're
                        picking on the recruits and the brutal treatment of recruits and the other,
                        too many officers and not enough professional sergeants and that sort of
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That had always been the case, but there were protests, particularly by
                    the mothers, when the actual need for an imperial military had ceased. The
                    decline of the huge continental army, particularly after the failure of
                    Afghanistan, the mothers' union had representation in the legislature, were big
                    supporters of Yeltsin who leaned on the military to clean it up, or at least
                    begin an attempt to clean it up. But of course the hazing traditions were
                    centuries old in character, very difficult to eradicate and to eliminate in the
                    officer corps and start again, which they haven't done. So there is a withering
                    away of the old Soviet military, I would say, but it is going slowly.
                    Conscription remains a great thorn in the side of Russian society, as it is in
                    many societies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned, being well in place before these
                        developments, and already being an old hand in MoscoI would have thought
                        that every do-gooder or academic in the United States who had any
                        pretensions of knowing what to dand Europeans, the equivalent in academics
                        and think-tankers and all would be flooding in there, a lot of them with a
                        lot of cockamamie ideas and I mean, I think they'd almost sort of clog the
                        arteries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that was happening. There were many thousands in Russia from the
                    West of that character. Some were helpful, many were not, and most were of no
                    consequence one way or the other, but they were part of the environment of
                    change taking place.</p>
                <p>On the whole, I think the presence of Western groups was a plus because it
                    brought the outside world into Russia itself. Yes, the phenomenon of Seventh Day
                    Adventists and Mormon missionaries and Chicago school economic evangelists were
                    examples of the kinds of strange and wonderful things from the West appeared
                    then in Russia. Many groups had some attraction to those Russians in great
                    distress, particularly if they brought real help and money along with them. It
                    was part of the equation.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>But the Russians were also traveling to the West. They were traveling out into
                    the world, and seeing things for themselves, sometimes on official business, or
                    as guests of the West, and NGO organizations. These journeys to the West had a
                    very powerful impact on the thinking of the leadership elite. It was a very
                    important plus, I'd say, was the availability of exchanges. On the official
                    level, certainly, like the kind that the Bill Bradley amendment and the programs
                    the Library of Congress, Jim Billington sponsored and promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Billington being the Librarian of Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Senator Bradley's program of education of high school students, at
                    the high school level in the United States. These were very important, they
                    helped shape the first generation of new Russian leaders. I regret that it
                    hasn't been continued at the levels of the past, because I know such travel and
                    learning opportunities have a profound effect through many generations if we had
                    kept that up, bringing them here to understand what we are. These exchanges
                    enable us to go there to Russia, as well, to understand what they were becoming.
                    Tragically, we have cut the resources for those enormously effective positive
                    programs. I think we've missed an opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, when did you leave Moscow?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I left Moscow when the U.S. presidential election took place.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes. I was in the Clinton foreign policy group, and after the election it
                    was clear that I would be a part of the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that develop? How does onBill Clinton was coming
                        out of Arkansas, and although he had been involved in other groups, I mean,
                        still, he was a small state's governor and not exposed to foreign policy as
                        far as having to really deal with it. How did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>MILLER: Bill Clinton is obviously a very skillful politician. It was, perhaps the
                    luck of the political game that some individuals didn't run who might have won
                    had they run. Bradley, for instance. So Clinton won, and after he won he put
                    together teams for the transition, the transition being the period between the
                    election and inauguration. It is during the transition that the new President
                    decides what needs to be changed in the way of policies and people. Clinton
                    began choosing the people he wanted to fill the several thousand slots (actually
                    about 3,200 slots) at the policy level that are regarded as presidential
                    appointments. It is during the transition that the shaping of the new government
                    takes place.</p>
                <p>Clinton was very interested in foreign policy, he directed the policy goals and
                    chose the new foreign policy team himself, along with the new Vice President, Al
                    Gore, as well. Clinton's closest advisors included people who were part of his
                    Oxford experience. Strobe Talbott, for example. The networking that is normal in
                    Washington came into play. In my case, I'd known Strobe all during the period of
                    perestroika and before, and for both of us that was part of our experience, he
                    being a Russian-Soviet-scholar and journalist and I because of my work in the
                    Soviet Union. We both shared an Oxford experience and we had many mutual friends
                    in the Clinton group. Tony Lake, who was appointed National Security Advisor,
                    was my first student at Harvard, when I was a tutor in History and Lit. The head
                    of personnel and recruitment was Brian Atwood, who was later head of AID, and he
                    was on the Hill with me. He was with Tom Eagleton when I was working for John
                    Sherman Cooper, Frank Church and Mac Mathias, so we were colleagues. Leon Fuerth
                    was Gore's long time foreign policy assistant, and was also on the Hill. Dick
                    Moose came into the Foreign Service about the same time and he was a friend here
                    at home for many, many years and still is a friend.</p>
                <p>There are many elements that contribute to the makeup of a political team such as
                    neighbors, schools, experience. That's how the transition teams were put
                    together and the transition involved writing papers, speeches, laying out
                    agendas for the work of the incoming government. I was a part of that process.
                    It was very clear that they wanted, in my case, to send me to the former Soviet
                    Union, either to Moscow or Kyiv. Tom Pickering, my good friend, went to Moscow.
                    I went to Kyiv.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working on this transition and all this,
                        whaStrobe Talbott was sort of the major force in looking at the former
                        Soviet Union, was he, sort of? What was the feeling? What could we do
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, he and Clinton, both believed that the new Russia could become a
                    positive force for stability. Conversely, if it didn't receive assistance and
                    some direction, particularly to continue the control and reduction of nuclear
                    weapons, that it could be a force for instability. The believed that it was a
                    crucial, highest priority to deal with the former Soviet Union. They created,
                    structurally, in the government, a separate State Department bureau.
                    Bureaucratically, you know how hard that is. They carved out of EUR the former
                    Soviet Union. To staff this new bureau, Strobe and President Clinton chose all
                    of the key players. Many were from the Foreign Service ranks but not all, and
                    they wanted the new bureau to have direction, from the President through
                    Strobe.</p>
                <p>Clinton's vision was that he could work with the new leadership, with Yeltsin and
                    his group because they were part of the dynamics that had changed, that ended
                    the Soviet Union.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, from the outset there were people who were sentimental about the
                    Gorbachevian approach and would have preferred that, but that wasn't an option.
                    The Gorbachev option was closed off by Gorbachev himself and the leadership

                        saying with Yeltsin ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Yeltsin's group was able enough, open enough and had worked with our
                    official people and some of our NGOs throughout the perestroika period, so the
                    Clinton administration was able to deal with them directly immediately. There
                    was a belief that the United States and the West could have considerable
                    influence, which was the case. Some of it unfortunately wasn't of the highest
                    quality, but, on the whole, certainly on the issues of arms control and nuclear
                    arms control, the dangers, that side of equation, were taken care of quite well.
                    The understanding of the difficulties of the economic transition no one did very
                    well; neither the Russians or the new republics or the United States or the
                    West. We missed in profoundly disturbing ways the importance of working through
                    the economic transition more skillfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to go back to this hard transition. Was there much
                        change vis-�-vis dealing with the former Soviet Union between the Bush One
                        administration and Clinton?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, I really don't think so. The difference between, say, Jack Matlock
                    and Tom Pickering and how they behaved in MoscoI don't think you could tell the
                    policy difference at all. Both Tom and Jack are good friends to this day, and I
                    think Jack had as good an understanding as any of the Clinton people. His advice
                    was given and welcomed by Clinton and Strobe. No, I think the establishment of
                    Soviet hands, State Department spooks and academics were on the whole coherent
                    from one administration to another, and of course Congress, being as
                    conservative as it is, as an organizatiothat is, the key Congressmen and
                    senators stay there for such a long time, they are the reason for policy
                    continuity, even if an administration lasts only four or eight years. They're
                    there for 25 years. They're far more the policy balancing force even than the
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>So the path of dealing with the new Russia, the former Soviet Union, did not
                    require taking a radically different new direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, as you were working on this, was Warren
                        Christopher much of a player, or was it pretty much, from your perspective,
                        dealing with the former Soviet Union was a Strobe Talbott thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was a direct, personal Clinton interest. Clinton was the policy maker.
                    Clinton shared the views of Strobe, who, of course, had a far more detailed
                    knowledge of the Soviets and the new Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Clinton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Clinton was unusual, certainly compared to Bush. He wanted to make policy
                    and to run policy. He liked doing the job of policy direction and, being as
                    smart as he is, learned what he didn't know. He always wanted to be involved. He
                    spent a lot of time going to Moscoback and forth, back and forthe loved it.
                    Strobe did, and Warren Christopher did, too, but Warren deferred to Strobe. His
                    personality is such that he allowed a subordinate to take over the portfolio,
                    but Christopher had a deep interest in it. His views were not dissimilar, sand
                    they all had plenty to do.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Christopher was the president's lawyer. As long as he was there, in the
                    administration, the ethical standards were very high.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The conflict of interest, I'd say, was the acute question, and, from the
                    outset, the Russians and all of the former Soviet states did not make clear the
                    difference between personal activity and governmental activity. I've come to the
                    conclusion, that one reason for this, is that there was only the state in the
                    Soviet system. Soviet leaders were the state, so whatever they did was correct.
                    They found it very difficult to make a separation between public and private.
                    The conflict of interest standards that we have, which says, basically, that if
                    you're in government service you cannot benefit from your government service
                    personally while you are in office. After that the standard for conflict of
                    interest gets murky; because of the people who go in and out of government
                    service and who trade on their previous experience - the lobbyists for example.
                    We've even put a firewall on that kind of influence by saying, that for two
                    years for peoplambassadors can't take any position, for example, and I think
                    that's true of generals and so on, that for two years, the use of privileged
                    access and information, the lobbying phenomenon is prohibited. It's not enough
                    of a firewall, but it's a boundary that has had some benign effect.</p>
                <p>We believed that, that you shouldn't make money because of your government work
                    while in government. The Russians made no such separation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were dealing with a
                        country that had never had anything but essentially the state running
                        things, I mean, really running things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, absolutely. For me, as I never understood how we failed to
                    understand how these huge new nations were going into moneyed economies, dealing
                    with other economies that had money when they did not have any distributed
                    capital. They had to convert their assets, their land, factories, enterprises,
                    their gold, diamonds, metals, wood into cash. The methods of doing thabarter,
                    monetization of some kinwere extremely difficult for them to undertake in any
                    equitable way. We had nothing very useful to tell them, or really any valid
                    advice, that they could accept. The leaders didn't accept conflict of interest
                    restrictions because the leaders knew they had to acquire wealth in order to
                    stay in power. They understood that power requirement right away: that money was
                    power and that the only place they could get money was to take the state assets.
                    So the old Soviet, now Russian leaders, took the state assets and made money for
                    themselves and their friends. That's why they're now in power. That's why
                    they're millionaires, billionaires. They made capital directly from state
                    assets. Some of the most prominent stole from the state to stay in power.</p>
                <p>That, of course, started in the time of Gorbachev, when the new economy was
                    beginning. Led by Gorbachev and the perestroika groups, private economy was
                    accepted by the Communist state. Under Soviet law and ideology a private sector
                    was prohibited. The laws explicitly said you can't have private enterprise or
                    hold capital. To make profits was criminal. However, there were loopholes and
                    the overriding precept - the Gorbachev dictum was, “Whatever is not prohibited
                    is permitted.” So he and the now Capitalist Soviet leaders drove trucks through
                    those loopholes, and the courts were instructed and the law enforcement was
                    instructed to allow the trucks to drive through these loopholes.</p>
                <p>For some reason, our overall philosophy was, “Well, that's the Wild West, the
                    Wild East, it'll be a very quick transition and it will all trickle down.” The
                    remnants of trickle-down economic notions, the romanticism of the Gilded Era, in
                    the sense that, of course, the robber barons would become philanthropists as
                    ours did. The path that was taken was a huge mistake. What we in the West should
                    have advocated, along with them, as some of them did, was to work out,
                    carefully, methods for equitable distribution of state assets. They should have
                    required full value for the sale of State assets. They should have used the sale
                    of assets for revolving funds for infrastructure needs. The Marshall Plan
                    approach, basically, would have been a sound basis for developing the means for
                    a democratic economic system rather that the oligarchic system they actually
                    developed. They didn't do that. They're still not doing it.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, they were all involved, but none to the extent that we were. We had
                    such a huge preponderance of power, both military and economithe EU hadn't taken
                    hold yet, it was beginninso the European influences were still from separate
                    nations, rather than the EU, as a European entity, although it was beginning to
                    have coherence. We were the leader, so they were following our power-lead, and
                    the influence that was in the international bankWorld Bank, IMF, EBRD (European
                    Bank for Reconstruction and Development), and the other development banks, were
                    all following our lead. We were ignorant, grossly so, about what to do, which
                    was understandable in retrospect, perhaps.</p>
                <p>

                <p>MILLER: In the case of Ukraine, yes. It was the third largest recipient of
                    foreign assistance, from us, just from the United States, and from the banks,
                    the international banks of comparable levels. What was missing was a sense, on
                    the one hand, from the Ukrainians, what kind of economy they wanted to have,
                    what proportiothings are moving.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The transition team and all of that? How that works?</p>

                        were there any problems, and that sort of thing. So we'll pick it up
                        then.</hi>

                <p>MILLER: Yes, all right.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the twelfth of March, 2004. Bill, just to reprise
                        a biwho composed the transition team to the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the key players in the State Department transition team, I would
                    say, were Tony Lake, Richard Moose, Leon Fuerth, Warren Christopher, and Brian
                    Atwood. These were all significant figures in previous administrations. They had
                    held high positions in foreign affairs. The transition team of Clinton, just as
                    other president's transition teams, was also composed of people who were
                    involved in the campaign, so they were really political operatives. A number
                    were office-seekers who had a place in the transition which they carved for
                    themselves, in many cases, because of money given or services rendered during a
                    campaign not because of experience or skills or ability in foreign affairs. Then
                    there were the bureaucratic professionals, who were expected to continue to hold
                    key positions in the new administration. The transition team I just described
                    were in charge of putting together the policy papers for the new president and
                    the new administration, and to draw up lists of personnel who would be appointed
                    by the president to key positions.</p>
                <p>It was very free-forone could not say it was an orderly process. It was governed
                    by the collegiality and comfortable familiarity of many of the individuals
                    involved. There is, in this sense, a continuity in our political system, even in
                    foreign affairs and defense. The people who go into policy work tend to do it
                    for a lifetime, even if there are interruptions because of change of party and
                    changes of direction in individual professions. So this was not a group of
                    people without experience. They were extremely experienced, and were able to
                    draw on an enormous reservoir of experienced people. The non-governmental world
                    is characterized by the think tanks, which are, in some respects, holding places
                    for people who would like to be running things in government and have done so in
                    the past. It was the place of lawyers, who were involved in legal work on
                    international matters, or they were doing legal work in campaigns. The Council
                    on Foreign Relations in New York and Washington is another holding place, as are
                    the faculties and institutes in the major universities. If you had to give
                    numbers, there were several thousand people who were milling about in the
                    transition, most, of course, were on the fringes hoping to break into the inner
                    circles.</p>
                <p>The transition had two major categories. First, personnethat is, who was going to
                    be appointed to what position, and how they were to be vetted. The second was,
                    what is the policy going to be, and the articulation of that in position papers,
                    many of which were expansions of major themes that were delivered in speeches
                    during the campaigns. Despite occasional heated rhetoric, the area of foreign
                    affairs is on the whole, very conservative. The differences between Democrats
                    and Republicans are not very great. In the end, there was not a great difference
                    in overall policy. The Bush II administration is different - hard-line,
                    unilateralists, who believe in the active the use of military power and military
                    measures to achieve regime change. This is a radical departure from the past.
                    But up until Dubya's time, I would say, the difference between Democratic and
                    Republican on the major questions was not great. There were different
                    personalities, of course, and different styles of personal leadership, but the
                    post Cold War agenda was the same basically, for both Republicans and
                    Democrats.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>So from the outset, I was involved in the writing of policy papers. There wasn't
                    much that needed to be written during the Clinton administration because their
                    emphasis was to stay on message. Staying on message is the modern approach in
                    presidential elections for both parties, not very many messages, carefully honed
                    to acceptable generality, with the further emphasis of, “It is the economy
                    stupid?” So foreign affairs were all the more conservative because there was no
                    interest in creating unnecessary domestic political waves that could be
                    attacked. Within the consensuses, these international consensuses that the end
                    of the Cold War brought about a sense of assured security and peace, an unusual
                    feeling of euphoria, of possibility, that things were going well. The sense of
                    danger that pervaded the Cold War was gone. So the major foreign policy issues
                    were, “How are we going to manage the United Statethat is, how is the United
                    States going to manage the opportunities that the end of the Soviet Union had
                    presented, how were the issues of globalization going to be advanced. The United
                    States' economy was booming, the high-tech revolution was reflected in the great
                    economic bubble of that time, where so many dotcoms were created to take
                    advantage of the new opportunities in the new world of information
                    technology.</p>
                <p>Trade and economic policy became very important. The two pillars of economic and
                    political policy were to be support for institutional democratic governance and
                    free market. In some cases, free market was first and democratic government was
                    second. Arms control was no longer the overriding danger except in countries
                    like Ukraine where getting rid of the existing nuclear weapons stocks, was a
                    priority. The great fear of the Cold War, that these weapons might be used, was
                    gone. The remaining fear was that the weapons lying around in unguarded
                    stockpiles might get stolen by an irresponsible group; so the elimination of
                    stockpiles was still a priority in arms control. There were briefing books put
                    together, as they had been from the beginning of the campaign, which covered
                    every issue. They were similar to the briefing books that the secretary of state
                    has when he goes up to testify before the Foreign Relations Committees in the
                    House or Senate. Every issue was reduced to short essay, a one-pager and talking
                    points; the points tend to be eloquent or arresting, or that's the attempt. It's
                    not a very profound process, it's a summary of thinking up to that point.
                    There's a value in that.</p>
                <p>The selection process really was in the hands of those who had won the election.
                    They wanted to put people in place who they knew, valued, and trusted, in
                    positions of responsibility. That was done rather quickly. The first set chosen,
                    of course, were the Cabinet officers, and the key positions were in the State
                    Department, and in Defense. Far less so in the CIA or the intelligence agencies;
                    there were no real changes sought or carried out. The critical positions were
                    who was going to be secretary of state, who was going to be national security
                    advisor, and who was going to handle particular areas of the world. On the
                    defense side, Aspin ?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Les Aspin ?</hi>

                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>MILLER: Les Aspin, Congressman Aspin, who had been chairman of the House Arms
                    Services was the one who was going to be secretary of defense, and he was chosen
                    because of his service to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, long
                    work on defense matters, deep knowledge, and able staff. The second, the deputy,
                    of course, was Perry, Bill Perry, a distinguished nuclear weapons scientist and
                    technologist, and they brought along people who could manage the Defense
                    Department that came out of previous administrations. They were either from
                    previous administrations or linear descendants of the kinds of officials that
                    were in previous administrations. It was very evident for Clinton that there
                    would be a strong defense policy, that there would be an emphasis on arms
                    control and arms salethe control of arms saleas well as strategic weapons, and
                    that the budget would be triangulated between the big spenders and the
                    minimalists. That it would be an equilibrium approaca search for greater
                    efficiencies, but we would have the forces that the majority, as understood by
                    the policy consensus, from left to right, believed optimum. The Clinton Defense
                    policy was a good example of so-called triangulation of the amounts, even the
                    breadth and depth of defense policies.</p>
                <p>NATO expansioor what to do with NATwas the major defense issue for the West.
                    First, whether NATO should exist at all in the absence of the Warsaw Pact. I
                    start with defense because that's the big money hog, and the appointments to DOD
                    [Department of Defense] helped shape all the other appointments in the foreign
                    affairs area. Warren Christopher was chosen, because of his previous experience
                    in State as deputy secretary. He was also chosen because of his work during the
                    campaign as the head lawyer, and the moral arbiter of government employees'
                    behavior. He's the one who set the standard for ethical behavior. He's the one
                    who insisted, among others, on the so-called nanny lathat is, requiring Social
                    Security benefits to household help. There were a number of instances where
                    Cabinet nominations fell by the wayside on that. But the president had his ideas
                    of who he wanted, and he knew and liked Strobe Talbott. Clinton was always
                    interested in Russia and Europe, particularly in the outcome of the Soviet
                    Union. He was comfortable with Talbott's views and he wanted to be sure that
                    Strobe could run those matters. He liked, initially, Tony Lake because of his
                    previous experience.</p>
                <p>Madeleine Albright, for example, going to the UN, was there as one of those who
                    had worked with and for major Democratic figures in the past. Strobe was there
                    being the friend from Oxford days, of the president's. Albert Gore, his
                    vice-president, had many people who had worked with him, like Leon Fuerth, in
                    the Senate. The Senate network was very important. Leon Fuerth was a very good
                    friend of mine, for example. I helped him get a job on the Hill in the first
                    instancI was one of the very first to go to the Hill in the Vietnam period,
                    resigning from the State Department over Vietnam. A number of others came to the
                    Hill, for a variety of reasons, including Vietnam. Some came to the Hill simply
                    to have a new direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>Dick Moose, who was head of State Department administration in previous
                    administrations, was back in that job. Brian Atwood, who had been a Senate aide
                    when I was in the Senate, was headed for AID, and he was in charge of personnel
                    appointments. He did the systematic work of reviewing resumes and evaluating
                    qualities, and rankings. I was very much involved, as you know, in Soviet
                    matters during the period of perestroika, as head of the International
                    Foundation, the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, and was being
                    considered for either Moscow or Ukraine. Ukraine became a very serious problem
                    because of its nuclear arsenal, I was asked to consider going to Ukraine, and
                    this suggestion was made rather early, starting, I'd say, in December or January
                    after the election in November, because of the real concern about the
                    disposition of this third largest nuclear arsenal in the world. I said, “I'm
                    more informed about what is now Russia,” what had become Russia, but Ukraine
                    sounded like a very interesting and important challenge.</p>
                <p>By January, they had made their minds up about who was going to the major
                    embassies, and the major positions in the departments had been chosen. Most
                    positions went down about three or four layers. There weren't all that many of
                    the 3,200 so-called “plums” for executive appointment. There are really not that
                    many, given the enormous size of our government. The network of people who had
                    been involved in the campaign, had worked in the legislature with these people,
                    had been involved in one way or another in their lives over several decades,
                    number three or four times that. The network of people who could have a chance
                    to be given a position number about 20,000 people who could appointed. Far less
                    than that, a few thousand, and you reduce that by a quarter and you have the key
                    ones. In the case of State, the secretary and the major assistant sec down to
                    assistant secretary, the key embassies, and everything else, filters out over
                    time. So I was told very early that I would be appointed ambassador and I began
                    the lengthy arduous process of filling out the security clearances and the
                    financial statements. The full process takes at least several months. The actual
                    vetting of the forms, particularly the financial statements, were done by the
                    lawyers in Clinton's White House. They were from Clinton's Arkansas group. Even
                    though it was a routine matter it took considerable time. The Senate, of course,
                    had its processes of review, hearings and confirmation.</p>
                <p>By June all the security and background vetting had been done and preparations
                    were made for the Senate hearings and the formalities of swearing in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem on the hearings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the hearings were a delight. Most of these hearings for confirmation,
                    in fact, all of them, except for secretary were for sets of two or three or four
                    people. My group included Dick Holbrooke, ambassador to EU, Stuart Eisenstadt,
                    Robert Hunter to NATO, Dick Gardner who went to Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>There were four of them. Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, who was chairman, who
                    I'd known and worked for for many years, was extremely supportive, and the
                    Virginia senators, of course, as is the custom, I resided in Virginia, and the
                    Rhode Islanders because we lived during the summers in Little Compton, Rhode
                    Islanthey were all supportive. The questioning was serious about Ukraine.
                    Senator Biden and the rest of the committee questioned carefully and were very
                    anxious to help. It was a very positive experience for me. No one really had any
                    questions that were not thoughtful and serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back to when you got on the team. One is
                        struck by this last changeover from the last administration, from the end of
                        the Clinton administration to the beginning of Bush Two. One has the feeling
                        that anything the Clinton people did was almost poison, and here was a group
                        that came in very suspicious and wanted to stop everything and take a long
                        hard look, and much of it was not just normal policy but a genuine feeling
                        that Clinton and his cohorts were on the wrong track. When you came in on
                        this transition team, what was the feeling toward the Bush One
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I think towards the president, George Bush, there was no animosity.
                    I think the Gulf War was an issue. The differences between the
                    administrationthere wasn't enough difference on the Gulf War, the invasion of
                    Kuwait by Iraq was enough of a reason to have majority support. The question of
                    whether more could have been done before the war, before the invasion, the whole
                    question of ambiguous signalthese were issues. I don't think there was that much
                    difference. It was in degree, on spending and tone, really. George Bush the
                    elder came from the establishment. He was always, throughout his political life,
                    well within the boundaries of the debate, from the earliest time he was never
                    erratic or extremist. So it wasn't a rejectionist situation at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any or much communication between James Baker,
                        the secretary of state, with Warren Christopher, the incoming secretary of
                        state, during this transition period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The Republicans and Democrats knew each other quite well, and they had
                    discussed matters, housekeeping matters, but they didn't need to have deep
                    conversations, they weren't unloading some batch of dark secrets that had to be
                    attended to. It was, I'd say, pro-forma. Very clearly they're not close friends.
                    They were not close friends, but they were colleagues. If anything, since they
                    were both lawyers, they knew of each other from the legal world. In the world of
                    foreign policy certainly from the time of, say, 1980, and the great changes that
                    began in the Soviet Uniothey were on the same page, and seeing many of the same
                    people. No, there wasn't a radical difference. It was an easy transition in the
                    sense that whatever needed to be imparted was, and not much needed to be
                    imparted.</p>

                        I was interviewing Roz Ridgeway. During the time between the end of the

                        said she knew James Baker did not have any contact with George Schultz

                        this was the same administration, but it was, let's say, a distant

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That's often the case, but that doesn't mean they're not aware of each
                    other's doings or activities. The calling in of your predecessors is not normal
                    in our practice, except in “wise man” exercises where you bring in several
                    preceding generations of leadership in order to give public, visible legitimacy
                    to what you're doing, and hope that you gain popular support for a tough
                    decision, something that requires consensus. Well, that certainly hasn't
                    happened in the present administration.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our primary concerns when you went out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The primary concern was the disposition of the third largest nuclear
                    arsenal in the world. ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) aimed at the
                    United States in sufficient number with the capability and invulnerability to
                    destroy the United States many times over. The control of those weapons was very
                    much an issue. Who owned them? Did the new Ukraine own them, did Moscow own
                    them? The Ukrainian government said they had the right, as a successor state, to
                    all objects on their territory, and they persisted in this, as was their right
                    under any understanding of the rights of successor states. However, at the
                    beginning of independence, the missile silo fields, the deployment made by the
                    43rd Rocket Army, were under the control of Russian commanders, even though the
                    Ukrainians asserted their right, very quickly. We did not know, but it was the
                    case, as I found out, that the Ukrainization of the 43rd Rocket Army was one of
                    their first priorities, and this process of takeover went very rapidly to take
                    over control. The 43rd Rocket Army was commanded by a general named Mikhtiuk who
                    was an ethnic Ukrainian, became a Ukrainian general in the newly formed army. He

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Even though the officers in the chain of command of the 43rd Rocket Army
                    in the silos believed that they were under Moscow control, and indeed sets of
                    codes and orders for the use of these weapons did come out of Moscow,
                    nonetheless the Ukrainians were able to short-circuit cut off Moscow control.
                    They were able to cut off Moscow links, since they designed them in the first
                    place and had constructed the communications links. The Ukrainian 43rd Rocket
                    army took them over.</p>
                <p>From a strategic point of view, the stability of these weapons was very much in
                    doubt. The feeling in Washington before I went out was that Ukraine was still
                    very unstable, very fragile, and might not survive as a state. The weapons had
                    to be either under Russian control or eliminated. It became clear that the new
                    Ukrainian government would never give them to the Russians. Secondly, it wasn't
                    clear in our minds that the Ukrainian government wanted to eliminate them. The
                    worst-case analysis was that they didn't want to eliminate them and that they
                    were under the control of a new, untested, unstable military leadership of
                    Ukrainians.</p>
                <p>My task, as expressed by our leaders, was to persuade Ukraine to eliminate its
                    nuclear arsenal. Strobe's view was he had this uncertainty about the stability
                    of Ukraine, as did the president and everyone else concerned with the issue. The
                    most active people in the government in the Clinton administration from the
                    outset were from the Defense Department. It was Secretary of Defense Aspin and
                    from the beginning Deputy Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and Assistant
                    Secretary Ashton Carter who were hard at work on this arms control issue.</p>
                <p>In the NSC (National Security Council), Tony Lake and Rose Gottemoeller, who
                    later went to the Department of Energy, but she was handling the Ukrainian
                    nuclear question for the NSC. And Nicholas Burns, who was later the ambassador
                    Greece, and then the ambassador to NATO and who is now Deputy Secretary of State
                    was the staff man on Ukraine at that point. So the concern was nuclear weapons.
                    The other was the viability of the state, what was the make up of the new
                    Ukraine? Could we work with it? Was Ukrainian policy going to be coherent? So
                    there were big question marks to all of the key issues. Frankly, we didn't know
                    the answers to these questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Crimean peninsula or Black Sea Fleet,
                        though, had that been solved by this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>MILLER: No, no, these were all live issues. The Black Sea Fleet, the disposition
                    of the Black Sea Fleet, a substantial naval force based in Sevastopol, Odessa, a
                    few other ports consisted of missile cruisers, destroyers, naval aviation,
                    submarines, aircraft carriers carrying nuclear bombs, and fixed radars of
                    tremendous power. The full apparatus of the Cold War was in place on the Black
                    Sea and particularly in Crimea. The formula for division of the former Soviet
                    fleet between Russia and Ukraine was under very contentious negotiations, as was
                    the question of the continued Russian military presence in Sevastopol and other
                    bases. At the time, the majority of the Russian-speaking population in Crimea
                    wanted to be a part of Russia rather than Ukraine. There was an uncertainty
                    about the outcome of the tensions in Crimea, and this was seen as a potential
                    conflict of great seriousness and danger.</p>
                <p>My instructions were, number one, get an agreement to eliminate the nuclear
                    weapons on Ukrainian territory, number two, figure out what these people are,
                    who they are, who we can deal with and how we can help, if it's going to be a
                    stable place, to become a stable government.</p>
                <p>A delegation of leaders from Ukraine had come to Washington right after
                    independence for discussions with the Diaspora, the Congressional caucus and the
                    new administration, probably in that order. It included some of the leaders of
                    Rukh, which was the Ukrainian nationalist independence movement, who were
                    pro-Western, but most suspicious of our tendencies, in their minds, to be
                    pro-Moscow.</p>
                <p>The Diaspora, for example, was highly suspicious of Strobe Talbott because of his
                    long interest in Moscow and Russia. The Diaspora didn't know what to think about
                    me, but they knew I had been living and working in Moscow, so they had to find
                    out whether I could be trusted, so to speak. The Diaspora groups did that, a lot
                    of this vetting, in their own interests, but also in the interests of the new
                    state of Ukraine, for which creation they had labored so mightily for 11 years.
                    I was asked to speak and meet at all the major Diaspora groups, in order to pass
                    inspection, so to speak.</p>
                <p>They had initial doubts because of my long work in the Soviet Union and in
                    Moscow, but decided that I was acceptable to them, that the Clinton
                    administrations declaratory policy in so far as it was articulated was that the
                    newly independent states of the former Soviet Union would be assisted in their
                    efforts to maintain their sovereignty. This was Brzezinski's view, which had a
                    very significant effect. He was the most articulate senior former official on
                    Ukraine. And, to some extent, Henry Kissinger, was of influence. On the other
                    side of the ledger, former President George Bush had been the author of what was
                    called the “Chicken Kyiv” speech, in which he said, in Kyiv, just before
                    independence, formal independence, that Ukraine should work with Gorbachev
                    keeping the Soviet Union together. This speech was given after Ukraine had
                    already declared its independence in August and was about to formally disband
                    the Soviet Union on Christmas day.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>In August, a delegation of members of parliament from the key parties came to
                    Washington from Kyiv, and asked to meet with me. They discussed nuclear weapons
                    with me, what their intentions were, what their aspirations were, what they
                    thought their rights were. They were seeking my views. I spent most of the time
                    listening, first, because they were very insistent about talking and making
                    their strongly held views clear. In turn, I made our position very clear, which
                    was we are for a strong, prosperous, sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine.
                    We think it's in the best interests of the Ukrainians and it's the best chance
                    for the former Soviet Union republic, particularly Russia, to not become an
                    empire again of the kind it was in the past. I said that I intended to work as
                    closely as possible with the Ukrainian government when I went to Kyiv we would
                    work with them. And that all I asked of them was the ability to talk things out
                    directly with them and to learn what was on their minds, what they thought their
                    priorities were. There was no reluctance on their part to agree to do that.</p>
                <p>We started off on, I think, a very sound foundation. That visit from the
                    delegation from the Rada, the parliament, which took place in August, just
                    before I left for Ukraine, was very helpful, to me, because it gave me the
                    grounds to discuss what I thought needed to be done here in Washington in the
                    way of framing policies, and to frame what I would intend to do. This is a very
                    important matter. Ukraine was a new state still in formation. Roman Popadiuk who
                    was our first ambassador under Bush, was there only for six months. The
                    Ukrainian government was not in shape to put itself together without assistance
                    and what Ukrainians called “moral support.” Our government didn't yet have the
                    power after the election, certainly, to do anything official.</p>
                <p>We were starting from scratch, really, as a matter of policy. So, I was shaping
                    policy as much as anyone because no one knew what to do. No one had any baseline
                    to work there, and there was no bureaucracy on these matters, because you're
                    starting tabula rasa (blank slate).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did Strobe Talbott have any strong feelings on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He had very strong feelings on the nuclear question. He was correctly
                    skeptical about the viability of many of the new states, and was definitely not
                    sure about where Ukraine would go, whether it would survive, although he
                    expressed the view that it could. The policy was, from the outset, at least as
                    long as I was involved was called two track. We would assist both Russia and
                    Ukraine to develop as democratic, free market nations and hope that they would
                    be integrated into the West, particularly Ukraine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that, looking at it purely in self interest,
                        that to keep Ukraine out of too close of embrace or being part of Russia
                        would be of great advantage to us, because it essentially would mean that,
                        without Ukraine there and it's 40 million people and it's land mass, it just
                        means that Russia is not going to be the powerhouse that it was before.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, that was the rubric that was laid down and accepted by many
                    political analysts. This rubric was formulated and laid down by Brzezinski. This
                    was his thesis, and it was held by others, but the great question about it was,
                    was thiand would it be viable? Would the differences between Ukrainian-speaking
                    portions, the West and the East, divided by the Dnipro, split the nation? Would
                    the Crimea revolt? Would the Russians balk on agreements to division of assets
                    such as the Black Sea Fleet? These were all unknowns, great doubts, and we
                    didn't know the new players particularly from Ukraine.</p>
                <p>No one in the Clinton Administration knew the players in Ukraine's new
                    government, and those few that they had met, they didn't like. They thought they
                    were equivocators. They believed they couldn't be trusted to hold their word,
                    which really meant they didn't agree with them, and they were stubborn and
                    difficult and awkward and unpracticed, which is quite understandable. Kravchuk,
                    the president, was a second or third-rank nomenklatura (Communist
                    bureaucracy).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: He was the president of Ukraine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Leonid Kravchuk, the first president, a Communist, I would say held
                    economic views that could be described as Gorbachevian, was definitely a
                    Ukrainian nationalist, but a supporter of independent Ukraine because he saw no
                    other way. The Soviet army would no longer work to keep the Soviet Union whole,
                    he was convinced, but his future and the future of the party structure, of which
                    he was a part, now had to lead and dominate a newly independent Ukraine. The
                    question of whether it would ever be back in union with Russia was too far down
                    the road. For Kravchuk and others it was an immediate question of how the party
                    of power would stay in power. Kravchuk concluded that Ukraine led by him and his
                    allies could only stay in power if Ukraine was an independent, sovereign state.
                    That evolving notion of a “Party of Power” is something that still is very
                    difficult for our policymakers to comprehend, namely: that in Russia now and in
                    Ukraine now in 1993, the party of power is composed of the same people who would
                    be in power if the Soviet Union had never split.</p>
                <p>Dealing with those lingering legacies of the party of power, of the Soviet man,
                    of the Soviet bureaucrat, the Soviet-trained teacher, professor, scientist,
                    military man, KGB, every field that you could think obankers, entrepreneuris
                    still the major problem. It won't cease to be a problem until there's a passage
                    of generations who deal with it and understand that it has to change and move on
                    to something else.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>High level meetings with Kravchuk and his aides were difficult, and the meetings
                    that they had at the diplomatic level with the new foreign ministry were even
                    more so. The foreign minister, Anatoly Zlenko, Borys Tarasyuk, Gennady Udovenko,
                    and the NSC advisor, Anton Buteiko, these were the key players Americans had to
                    deal with. They were intensely nationalistic, uncertain about U.S. motivations,
                    not as experienced or as at ease with Americans as their Moscow counterparts,
                    and they felt those differences.</p>
                <p>This was a psychological problem from the outset of rather large proportions. The
                    opening discussions about the disposition of nuclear weapons were
                    unsatisfactory. The premises concerning the rights of successor states were not
                    agreed to. The Ukrainian position was, “They're ours,” and our position was,
                    “No, they're not,” which was a mistake. I think we should have been, at a
                    minimum, agnostic, to say, “They're on your territory, we're worried about the
                    succession. Yes, they're there. What about that? Are we going to get rid of them
                    or not?” But we were preemptory, we spoke to the Ukrainians in a manner of
                    diktat (order). “You will get rid of those weapons.”</p>
                <p>Of course, Moscow shared that view. The Ukrainians felt Washington and Moscow
                    were ganging up against Kyiv, the new state. That impasse was created, in my
                    view, because of the initial approach and style taken. I decided, and perhaps
                    it's my temperament, to listen with courtesy and take no positions until I had
                    heard them out.</p>
                <p>Immediately after my arrival in Kyiv, I followed up on the earlier meetings I had
                    held with the legislators and the messengers from the Ukrainian government in
                    August in Washington. I met everyone I could, from Communists to
                    ultra-nationalists, and asked them all what they really thought.</p>
                <p>I had to do this very quickly, because there was great worry and anxiety in
                    Washington. There was also great concern about the hostile approach of the
                    United States towards Ukraine. Very soon after I had arrived, presented
                    credentials, had a very long meeting with President Kravchuk in Marinskiy
                    Palace, where we went over the basic issues and listed what we hoped to
                    accomplish together. Kravchuk said his government and the Rada had come to a
                    policy decision in Kyiv, which was that Ukraine would, in accord with their
                    previous declarations, even before independence, become a non-nuclear state.
                    They would agree to eliminate all weapons on their territory, provided security
                    assurances were given that we would support Ukraine in the event of military,
                    political, or economic pressure, and there would be economic assistance for
                    their dismantlement and elimination, and that we would support Ukraine
                    politically and economically through its initial difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>The main questions in Ukrainian minds was could the Americans be trusted to
                    support Ukraine fully. There were reservations both Kravchuk and the parliament
                    made clear. The parliamentarians and the president's government clearly
                    reflected the spectrum of views, including a substantial majority view, that
                    believed that the Americans couldn't be trusted to carry out their word, and
                    that Ukraine should retain its nuclear weapons as a hedge, as a deterrent, not
                    to be used, because the Ukrainian elite was very clear on the strategic utility
                    of the use of nuclear weaponry, but as a bargaining chip, to assure their
                    independence. So my task was to say, “You can count on us, we're with you.” And
                    after saying that to convince Kravchuk and the leaders of the Rada that the
                    United States would stand with them particularly comforting threats from
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>I reported immediately to Washington the resolution of the Rada on nuclear
                    weapons, which had these reservations, and I commented that I thought this was
                    the basis of a good agreement. The reaction from Washington was not what I
                    expected, rather it was along the lines of, “Go back and tell them there can be
                    no conditions except elimination.” And I said, “No, this is a good agreement.
                    Come and see for yourself.” Secretary Christopher, Talbott and a big DOD
                    delegation came within a week and we began the march on the path to agreement.
                    It was signed in Moscow the following January 14.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, hadn't we expressed our view that what the
                        Ukrainians were asking or demanding, that's what we were planning to do
                        anyway, wasn't it? To support the dismantling of these weapons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The attitude in Washington was that Ukraine led by Kravchuk would back
                    out or weasel out of an agreement as they had before. Kravchuk and the
                    Ukrainians wanted to be treated with dignity and respect. In the Ukrainian mind,
                    this was a noble act. I think it was a noble act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure it is. I mean, you're giving up your most powerfuit's
                        hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: this conscious action of elimination of their nuclear arsenal was a
                    fundamental foundation for a new state in a new world order, a foundation of
                    peace. It was a sacrifice and a very noble action that should be commended. I
                    think the skeptical, hard edged businesslike atmosphere of arms control
                    negotiations, as a method, or style, can prevent agreement, as was the case,
                    initially, with Ukraine. Worst-case analysis, being sure that every loophole
                    that the other side might use are covered, assuming that your own position is
                    Simon Pure and virtuous and your opposite number is duplicitous, the sensitivity
                    of a new nation, their need for dignities, their delicate new sense of honor,
                    diplomatic inexperience and awkwardness all had to be taken into account.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>I could see this as I became more and more aware and sensitive to the nature and
                    expression of Ukrainian behavior. I could see it, for example, in Moscow, where
                    the treatment of Kravchuk by Yeltsin. Yeltsin, looked on Kravchuk as a “little
                    Russian”, and he treated him that way. We treated Yeltsin as head of the largest
                    power next to the United States; Kravchuk was not treated as an equal, but as an
                    unavoidable participant. Even though President Clinton's behavior was very
                    genial to both Yeltsin and Kravchuk, not only congenial, but he was genial.
                    Clinton wanted everyone to have good feeling about the historic agreement. But
                    the Russian demeanor and the traditional arms control approach used during the
                    final hours of the negotiations was difficult, there was unnecessary hostility
                    aroused by battles over how much weight to give adjectives. There words were
                    terribly important at the time, but, in the long run, were not terribly
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you sensI interviewed our first ambassador to
                        Slovenia, and he said that he found that he was up against the Yugoslav
                        hands, Eagleburger and others. A lot of people have served in Yugoslavia a
                        lot of their career, myself included, but they kind of resented the fact
                        that Slovenia had broken away and was part of the process because of the
                        upset in Yugoslavia. And, somehow, being the first state to do it and being
                        the ambassador to that country from the United States, he picked up some of
                        the odium and all. He had a problem getting through, you might say, the
                        Yugoslav-influenced bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We had Soviet hands who spent their entire career on this, and did you find
                    yourself up against a bit of this? I mean, obviously, the people saying Russia
                    is the number one and who are these Ukrainian upstarts all of that?</p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, definitely. This was a concern the Ukrainians had felt very deeply,
                    that the American position, because it was the indisputable great power and
                    Russia, even diminished, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was perceived
                    and treated by us as a great power, and that Ukraine was not a great power. So
                    the assertion that Ukraine would be treated fairly and justly was something that
                    had to be proved. The Ukrainians had deep doubts that we would treat Ukraine
                    fairly and with dignity. Ukrainian leaders believed that long service in the
                    Soviet Union, in Moscow, by our foreign policy experts was operating against
                    Ukraine. So what we did to counter this sense of insecurity was - Strobe and Jim
                    Collins and others made this work - the White House, NCSC advisor Tony Lake and
                    most importantly, the president - was that every visit that was made to Moscow,
                    there would also be a stop in Kyiv. The President or other high officials would
                    either start in Kyiv or end up in Kyiv. So, every official that went to the
                    former Soviet Union, and there were almost weekly cabinet officer visits, was in
                    that framework of this two track policy. It was what I recommended. It was what
                    Strobe and the president believed in, and we carried it out, and it was very
                    effective.</p>

                <p>MILLER: It was pragmatic evidence of our intent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we have any problems with Belarus or Moldova or the

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there were problems of that character, the character you described.
                    Yes, and the difficulty is you can't be everywhere enough of the time, and the
                    decision was, Ukraine was the big one. But in the case of Belarus, the
                    independence movement of democratic nationalists was very weak; it collapsed
                    very quickly. It was very difficult for our ambassadors there to do
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, was that a problem for you, that things were not
                        going well there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, no, it wasn't a problem in the dealings I had on policy matters with
                    Ukraine, not at all. The contrast between what was happening in Belarus as
                    compared to Ukraine was so great that Ukraine seemed like a model of progress in
                    comparison. They came to stay with me a number of times, just to get out of the
                    place. They were having an awful time. They were being badly treated by what
                    eventually became the Lukashenko dictatorship, and even the ambassador's
                    residence was held hostage. They had to bear up under all sorts of petty,
                    horrible things. It was a nasty, nasty situation, but it was very clear from
                    early on that the dominant party of power in Belarus wanted to remain with
                    Russia. The size of the opposition was much smaller than the groups who wanted
                    to be a part of Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, in the Ukraine, to follow through on the
                        missile problem, were you getting an equivocation when you said, “Okay, I'm
                        willing to do this, but they need financial help and that sort of
                        thing?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: No, the initial rejection or doubt from Washington concerned whether
                    Kravchuk and the Ukrainian leadership could be believed or not, and I said,
                    “This is a good, acceptable deal,” and they were skeptical in Washington. They
                    had to come out and see it for themselves on the ground. And even then, when
                    they came, they were dealing with this difficulty of negotiations with people
                    like Kravchuk and Buteyko and Tarasyuk, who were very suspicious, resentful,
                    defensive, protective, thin skinned, very close to their dignities and we, as
                    representatives of a confident nation, are impatient, and as leaders of a great
                    power we sometimes behave arrogantly, and with little or no magnanimity. Clinton
                    was a personal exception. Clinton was magnificent all the time, because he
                    understood this feeling of uncertainty on the part of the Ukrainians and was
                    decisive in very important moments by saying and conveying the feeling that,
                    “I'm with you, I'm with you,” they got the point.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>Clinton further conveyed his own sense of how to approach and talk to the
                    Ukrainians, to his key aides, his advisers and his cabinet officers. He said
                    that that's the approach he wanted. This was the way he saw it, and they
                    responded accordingly. So, from the point of view of presidential help, for me,
                    I couldn't be more grateful than I am for Clinton's substantive help. He was
                    terrific in substance, and particularly the handling of psychological attitude.
                    He knew what was needed. He was absolutely brilliant. I marveled at how good he
                    was at this important quality of empathy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were the Russians trying to screw this up by having
                        their officers sitting on these missiles or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: I think they were trying to hold on to the control of the missiles. But
                    the Ukrainians had moved so decisively, first to surround, to ring all of the
                    missile silos with their own troops. They guarded every silo with Ukrainians who
                    had sworn allegiance to the new Ukraine, and were serving under Ukrainian
                    generals; speaking in the Ukrainians language; it was a constructive coup,
                    really, with the Soviet 43rd Rocket Army commander taking the oath as an
                    Ukrainian; so the apparatus, the line of military command, from top to bottom
                    became Ukrainian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, were the people we sent out there to supervise
                        this, did you have to make sure that they were aware of sensitivities and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Sure, but those who were sent to Ukraine were good. I have to say that
                    the help from the Pentagon, what became CTR (Cooperative Threat Reduction)
                    that's threat reduction prograthe Nunn-Lugar, were thoughtful, constructive, and
                    were real pros. They had taken advantage of all the work that had been done over
                    decades. They were extremely responsible and careful. I made sure that they
                    didn't go anywhere into the missile fields until they had briefed me first about
                    what they were going to do, and how, and with whom. The DOD, CTR delegations
                    always were required when they came to Ukraine for their two weeks or month
                    consultations, to brief me in full before and after their missions, with
                    authorizing documents and reports. I also went to all the nuclear weapons sites.
                    For example, I was the first American to go inside the Soviet rocket factory,
                    the former Soviet rocket factory in Dnepropetrovsk and Pavlograd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's in Ukraine.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, in Ukraine, where the SS-18s were manufactured. I was shown the
                    SS-18s on the assemble line. Several other rockets were under construction as
                    well. I went to every nuclear weapons facility of major importance and to all of
                    the dismantlement facilities of significance. I helped blow up the first SS-18
                    ICBM silo, the first command-control silo, initiated the first dismantlement
                    facility for rockets. In this process, I was helped by the secretary of defense,
                    Bill Perry, who was terrific, caring, not only interested in it, he was
                    knowledgeable about every aspect, and his staff, being of course the entire arms
                    control community, was delighted with this success of elimination.</p>
                <p>So they were a great help. Many of the DOD delegations had among their members
                    people I'd worked with for 20 years on arms control issues. One of my main
                    activities in the Senate was arms control. I came to the job in Ukraine with
                    probably more experience than anyone in the State Department, on the political
                    issues concerning SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) as well as the key
                    technical details, certainly on the legislative side of arms control agreements.
                    I knew by having been involved directly in the whole SALT process, backwards and
                    forwards, and I had the good fortune to have been tutored by our best nuclear
                    scientists during the '60s and '70s. They were and remain good friends. We are
                    working together now on the NPT issue with Iranian counterparts.</p>
                <p>So it was one of those rare occasions where my experience and qualifications fit
                    the Ukrainian situation perfectly. The new Ukrainian legislature, for example,
                    welcomed my 15 years experience as a Senate staffer in senior positions. Knowing
                    the structure of the American legislature as I did, I could see what might help
                    the new Ukrainian Rada. I was able to help them get assistance from the Library
                    of Congress. I was able to encourage congressmen and former congressmen and
                    staff to come work with them, as well as judges and key bureaucrats. My
                    experience in Ukraine is an argument for the utility of Foreign Service officers
                    working in the other branches of government at least for a time. I would say,
                    fellowships such as the American Political Science Association fellowships for
                    Foreign Service Officers is one of the most useful programs. Foreign Service
                    Officers should be given more experience on the Hill and a chance to observe the
                    judiciary, to see our entire government, local government, state government at
                    work. This kind of experience would be a very useful part of a Foreign Service
                    Officer's training or experience. Because when you get into a senior position,
                    as I did as ambassador in Ukraine, this experience can usefully come into
                    play.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the Russians in Moscow from the outset of the new Russian state in
                    1991 had declared their “near abroad” policy, which meant, “Our natural sphere
                    of influence includes Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltics, all the 'stans, the
                    Caucasus, historic, imperial Russia, the Soviet Union. This is our near abroad,
                    and this is where we have a right to be.” From the outset, when they enunciated
                    it, the new independent Ukraine understood that message and saw this policy by
                    Russia as a threat to their sovereignty. They expected, correctly, to see
                    interference in their internal affairs, political and economic pressures brought
                    to bear.</p>
                <p>The most difficult immediate strains between Moscow and Kyiv were in Crimea, the
                    majority of Crimean political parties were pro-Russian, particularly the
                    Communist Party. At the moment of independence, Crimea, had voted for union with
                    Ukraine. It was very evident that after several years, that the Russian
                    population in Crimea was restive, that they didn't like the new Ukraine,
                    partially because of the extreme economic distress, but also because the cutoff
                    from the normal amenities of Moscow. That was evident in the resorts and the
                    natural flow of goods and services, even the winemakers, makers of champagne,
                    wonderful Ukrainian champagne such as Novy Svet, had lost their markets. Even
                    though money in the old days wasn't the issue, production levels were; now it
                    was money that mattered.</p>
                <p>A Moscow inspired independence movement arose and grew and an independent
                    Republic of Crimea was declared. The strangest adventures I had in the Ukraine,
                    were my encounters with the newly declared Republic of Crimea.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Soon after I arrived in Ukraine, I traveled to Crimea. Travel to Crimea
                    had been out of bounds, initially. It was very sensitive. I was the first high
                    level foreign diplomat to go to Crimea. I had to get approval from the Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, and the Russian government of Sevastopol and the
                    governors of various regions of ostensibly independent Ukraine, but were in fact
                    areas that were still run and governed by Russians, from Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>A coalition of pro-Russian parties, composed the majority in the parliament of
                    Crimea. This majority declared Crimea a republic, an independent republic.
                    Moscow didn't formally recognize the new republics but they didn't declare them
                    breakaways either. I traveled to the region of the independent Republic of
                    Crimea as the United States Ambassador to Ukraine. I went first to Sevastopol,
                    which was in fact being governed and really run by the Russian commander of the
                    Black Sea Fleet. The commander of the Black Sea Fleet was very suspicious of the
                    purpose of my visit. He had been a submariner, a nuclear submariner, who had
                    commanded strategic nuclear submarines that patrolled off the east coast of the
                    United States, fully armed. For many years, Admiral Eduard Baltin had been a
                    leading officer of the nuclear fleet of the north. He had also served in the
                    Pacific. He was a major naval officer in the Soviet armed forces and now the
                    commander of the Black Sea Fleet. The Black Sea Fleet was an uncomfortable joint
                    command of the combined Russian and Ukrainian navies stationed in the Black
                    Sea.</p>
                <p>So I asked to see him. He generously gave me several days of his time and we
                    reviewed the fleet, together with the Ukrainian commander, who was given the
                    back of the hand by Admiral Baltin. I had separate meetings with the commander
                    of the Ukrainian and Russian navies, respectively. They never really got
                    together. There was always an expressed distance of rank and importance as if
                    from on high to the Ukrainian commander. This sense of disparity was reflected
                    in the numbers of active vessels based in Sevastopol. There were only a couple
                    of Ukrainian ships that were manned by the Ukrainian Navy. All the rest, many of
                    which were, in fact, rusting hulks, were Russians. Admiral Eduard Baltin, known
                    as the “Black Admiral”, was a very, very interesting, charismatic character. We
                    had extraordinary talks about many subjects ranging from strategic issues, arms
                    control, the future of Russia and Ukraine and considerable discussion about sea
                    faring novels ranging from Moby Dick to Tom Clancy's Hunt for Red October. All
                    of this talk was stimulated by an enormous amount of wine and vodka and cognac,
                    several huge meals. We toured several of his capital ships. He was most
                    concerned about the issue of whether the new Ukraine would survive? His interest
                    was political. He asked me very directly, “How do you see Ukraine.” I assured
                    just as directly, “I see it as an independent republic, and I see Crimea part of
                    Ukraine.” And he said, “No, Sevastopol is Russian. It can never be otherwise. It
                    is a part of Russian history. Many of our heroes are buried here. Most people
                    who live in Sevastopol are Russians. Look at the battlefield.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I understand the treaty with the Russians, but I'm here to say that the
                    policy of our government is that we support the sovereignty and territorial
                    integrity of Ukraine. This is part of Ukraine. I fully understand the history of
                    Crimea and I know it is deeply tied to Russian and Soviet history. But the
                    Soviet Union is dissolved. Russia and Ukraine are legitimate successor states
                    with separate sovereign territories. Ukraine and Russia share a common noble
                    history and have every reason to live at peace with each other. But I'm here to
                    pay my respects to you as commander of the Unified Black Sea Fleet.” I said,
                    “How do you see Ukraine?” He said, “I see Ukraine coming back to Russia. I look
                    on it like Canada, the way you see Canada.”</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>I said, “Canada is a separate sovereign nation.” He said, “No, they're dependent
                    on you.” So we had many discussions along those lines. Near the end of our talks
                    I said, “Would you come to the United States for a visit and talk to our new
                    naval people perhaps at the Naval War College at New port near my home in Rhode
                    Island? They'd be very interested in your experiences as a submarine commander.”
                    He said he would like to. He had seen my country from outside the coastal
                    territorial boundaries. I asked Baltin, “Three miles or six or twelve miles?” He
                    answered, “just outside the legal boundary.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Through a periscope.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. I saw him a number of times later. As I learned later, Baltin
                    reported to Moscow that I was a formidable person, probably CIA. He concluded
                    that the Americans are pursuing a very active policy that has to be countered.
                    Baltin testified in the Russian Duma on the situation in the Black Sea. My visit
                    to Sevastopol was discussed in the Duma, in the parliament. I saw him several
                    times thereafter. We went to the same dacha on the Black Sea on occasion. It was
                    the place where Gorky lived. The main buildings were constructed in the 19th
                    century. The main house, beautiful house where Gorky lived was surrounded by
                    gorgeous gardens. Teselli, as the place was called, was located next to
                    Gorbachev's dacha at Foros. I have gone back for a few days at a time, as often
                    as I could. Despite our official differences, I liked Admiral Baltin. He was a
                    very interesting, and obviously an extremely able person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, I come from sort of a naval background. I
                        lived in Annapolis, and seeing what I consider really beautiful ships that
                        the Soviets had put together, particularly in Vladivostok and also Murmansk,
                        sitting there kind of rotting. I would think the Black Sea Fleet, caught
                        between the Ukraine and Russia, who's going to maintain them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Nobody had the money to maintain them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a wasting asset, but obviously one that had deep

                <p>MILLER: Deep historic ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People had deep feelings about them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol, the places where many
                    distinguished Russians had lived like Chekhov, and where the Yalta treaty was
                    signed, all raised very emotional issues of patriotism, of honor, of
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter the Great had gone to great lengths to build a fleet
                        in that area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: In the 19th century, certainly, in the time of the Crimean War, capturing
                    it first from the Tatars who had lived there since the 13th century. Yes, it was
                    poignant to see the rusting hulks. Most of those hulks have since been scrapped,
                    and scrapping became a major profitable industry, scrapping the very same ships
                    that had been built in Nikolaev, just up the Dneipro River from Crimeaircraft
                    carriers, marvelous cruisers, the Kresta class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those cruisers were something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, lovely ships, and their frigates were also superb. The two navies
                    were working out their strategic and coastal interests for their future navies.
                    Ukrainians, for economic reasons, primarily, but also based on their own
                    strategic analysis, decided all they needed was a coast guard and maybe one or
                    two oceangoing frigates, maybe a Kresta class equivalent capital ship and that
                    was it. These ships would be supported by helicopters, a coast guard to work in
                    the Black Sea, and near the coastline. The existing Black Sea Fleet had enough
                    ships, usable ships, for both navies and they selected them from the former
                    fleet of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>So, the negotiations, which took five or six years, were focused on obtaining
                    those ships which were useful out of the large fleet for the new Ukrainian navy.
                    This new navy would be well within their allowed percentage of 20 percent. They
                    would use the other unneeded ships within their agreed percentage as barter
                    payments for gas and oil to the Russians, and that was to be the basis of the
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>On the issue of bases for the Russians, the Ukrainians simply said, “Your
                    presence here is awkward. We'll let you stay even 50 years, but you're here as
                    renters, and we will negotiate the rent. It's our territory. There are historic
                    reasons why you're staying. We don't like it, but we can't get you out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bit like Guantanamo Bay.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>MILLER: It is. Guantanamo is a very good analogy for Sevastopol. As difficult as
                    the basing issue in Sevastopol was, it was less difficult than the larger one I
                    referred to earlier: The Independent Republic of Crimea. Yuri Meshkov, was
                    elected president, by referendum of the independent republic. Ukraine did not
                    accord any legitimacy to the referendum or to the newly declared republic. With
                    the approval of the Ukrainian government, I went to meet with President Meshkov
                    in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea. I was the first official American to visit
                    Crimea under the independent circumstances, and certainly the first official to
                    meet with Meshkov. It was an astonishing, if bizarre first meeting. He had an
                    armed guard that surrounded him wherever he went of eight paratroopers dressed
                    in combat fatigues, field boots and armed with loaded Kalashnikovs.</p>
                <p>We met in his office, sat opposite each other in the middle of a very long table.
                    Meshkov was flanked by his Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He was very
                    nervous. He read from a prepared statement asking for the support of the United
                    States for the independent republic from Ukraine. I answered his formal greeting
                    with courtesy, I hope, and a very direct opening that said, “I'm the ambassador
                    to the sovereign state of Ukraine, and I'm very pleased to be in Crimea, which
                    is a very beautiful, historic part of Ukraine.” Despite this opening difference,
                    Meshkov was very welcoming and he was trying to explain how all this came about.
                    We talked about many things, where he was from. He had some Crimean roots, but
                    his closest ties were mostly Russia. His cabinet included some Russians
                    economists that I knew in Moscow. The prime minister, so-called, Suvorov was his
                    name, was one of the “new economists” in Moscow in the perestroika period. Some
                    of the other economists were people I had run into while in Moscow.</p>
                <p>The Meshkov government was putting together a cabinet to run a country that
                    obviously didn't have funds. They were supported to some degree even publicly
                    from Moscow through the party Meshkov led. It was a very tenuous situation,
                    because in Simferopol, which is the capital of Crimea, there was also a governor
                    of Crimea approved by Ukraine, who I also called on, as well as the Ukrainian
                    police chief, and the commander of the Ukrainian armed forces based in Crimea,
                    the Ukrainian forces. Meshkov survived for about a year during which time I
                    visited him several times. It was always interesting to meet with him in this
                    state of suspended animation. Meshkov somehow thought that the United States
                    would recognize his Republic of Independent Crimea as a sovereign state and that
                    he would receive aid and assistance.</p>
                <p>When Meshkov asked about U.S. assistance, I said, “Yes, we were very interested
                    in assisting development projects in Crimea, such as water projects for the city
                    of Yalta and Sevastopol. Mr. Meshkov and Mr. Suvorov, we'd be happy to do that
                    as a part of our assistance to Ukraine,” and we would work through the
                    government in Kiev. But in the face of all of this, he was very stoic, and very
                    courteous in many ways. I still have a bottle of Massandra wine that he
                    presented to me at one of our meetings, that was corked in the year of my birth.
                    I'm waiting for the right occasion to open that bottle of Massandra wine.</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>So I saw him from time to time and we maintained a reasonably civilized
                    relationship. At the same time that I met with Meshkov and the Ukrainian
                    governor, I also met with the Tatars. The Tatars had been demonstrating in front
                    of the Crimean Parliament building on the question of representation in the
                    parliament as well as implementation of the right of return of Tatars from
                    Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were expelled under Stalin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Right, and about 450,000 had been forcibly deported to Kazakhstan,
                    Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Those that had survived and were able to return
                    were led by two Tatars who I knew from meetings in the United States. They had
                    come to the United States to participate in several human rights conferences
                    when I was President of the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations. Mustafa
                    Dzhemilev, who was the leader of the Tatars, and Rifat Chubarov, both of whom
                    are now deputies in the Ukrainian parliament. They are still the leaders of the
                    Tatars in Crimea.</p>
                <p>We met again in Kiev. I called on them in turn in Crimea. They showed me their
                    parliament, Mejles, and we toured the many Tatar historic sites together and met
                    with the other Tatar leaders. We had wonderful meals at Tatar restaurants. We
                    had the chance to review many things. It was the first of many meetings that I
                    had in Simferopol with the Tatar community. Every time I go to Crimea, I call
                    on, in particular, Mustafa Dzhemilev, who is a great hero of the human rights
                    movement.</p>
                <p>The Tatars asked for help from the United States in support of their ethnic
                    rights and I was happy to give that. The Tatars were asking for their rights
                    guaranteed by the Ukrainian constitution, the UN Charter and other international
                    conventions that Ukraine was a party to. To the credit of both Kravchuk and
                    Kuchma, they supported the right of Tatar return and giving to the Tatars full
                    rights as citizens, even though they were very sensitive to the fact that the
                    Russian-speaking people who had come and settled in Ukraine after the Second
                    World War, particularly in Crimea had taken over their lands and their homes.
                    Most of the population of Crimea had been wiped out, the Russians by the Nazis,
                    deported in the case of ethnic minorities, or majorities, in the case of the
                    Tatars, but also Bulgarians, Greeks, Germans, all of the Black Sea ethnic
                    groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Germans, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>MILLER: Germans, and some Jews, a small number of Jews. Germans, certainly who
                    had been settled there by Catherine; and the merchants and fishermen among the
                    Greeks, Bulgars and Romanians. But the resettlement of Crimea after the war were
                    forced migrations to Crimea of three major groupings: one from Bryansk, one from
                    the northern part of Ukraine, and the third group was from Voronezh. It was a
                    massive post World War II settlement, so the present Russian majority were the
                    result of post 1945 immigration. They were new-comers, relatively, and had not
                    been there for hundreds of years as had the Tatars.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of independent Ukraine in 1991, those three issues: Black Sea
                    Fleet; Russian presence, the Independent Republic of Crimea, and the Tatar
                    minority question, were on the hot burner. All three issues went to the UN. The
                    United States supported Ukraine's sovereignty in the question of Crimea. We
                    supported the minority rights of the Tatars, in accord with the Ukrainian
                    constitution and laws, and we supported the Ukrainian position on the division
                    of the Black Sea Fleet on an agreed basis, and a limited term of rental for
                    Russian basing in Crimea.</p>
                <p>Those were tests of our support for Ukraine. We met those tests. When the Ukraine
                    asked for support, we gave it, and vigorously, and in the form that they needed.
                    The particular form was full support for their territorial integrity and
                    sovereignty.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all in the probleis it
                        Moldova?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Transdneistr is the issue. Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got half that thing with sort of a Russian
                        subgroup.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was a Russian enclave maintained by a military division. It was a
                    garrison of Russian troops. But the garrison never left. A maverick general
                    stayed behind at the time of independence and they set up kind of a renegade
                    state. Transdneistr is such a curious entity: borders that have Moldovans on the
                    Ukrainian sidethnic Moldovans. And then there are Ukrainians living just behind
                    Russian settlements, so the Russians are in between, sort of a military buffer
                    between. There are no real problems between Moldova and Ukraine. The problem
                    that everyone has is with the remnants of a Soviet division, the remains of the
                    pre 1991 Soviet garrison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just demographics will take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. The military capacity of the division is diminishing and the Soviet
                    generation will pass. Some of the same issues also pertain on the Romanian
                    boarder with Ukraine. In the so-called Bukovina region there are issues of
                    whether Ukrainian is to be spoken in Romanian border towns, or Romanian to be
                    spoken in Ukrainian border towns, and whether they can visit each others icons
                    and many small persistent nagging problems that need to be settled by careful,
                    tolerant agreement.</p>
                <p>Actually, I helped in the settlement of the major border dispute between Romania
                    and Ukraine, a longstanding one, which had to do with the so-called “Snake
                    Island”, which is in the mouth of the Danube. This island marks the boundary
                    between Ukraine and Romania. The boundary was fixed by so-called “Stalin -
                    Ribbentrop Agreement”, which the successor independent Romanians did not accept
                    as valid, because it gave them less territory than they believed they were
                    entitled. The mouth of the Danube has shifted with the formation of the
                    delta.</p>
                <p>Snake Island is used as a demarcation point. The Snake Island region also has
                    oil, and that's a big part of the dispute. So, the issues of agreeing upon
                    boundary demarcation, accepting the Stalin-von Ribbentrop agreement were
                    problems that historically Ukrainians and Romanians could agree upon. Our
                    ambassador in Bucharest asked if I would join him in a mediation effort. I
                    invited my colleague Ambassador to come to Kyiv. He came to Kyiv for the first
                    negotiations. We then met at the Foreign Ministry with the Minister of Foreign
                    Affairs, the National Security Advisor, and the Ambassador from Romania to Kyiv
                    came as well. We then met with the Romanian ambassador in Kyiv and identified
                    the outstanding issues and worked our way through them: “This should be agreed
                    on now, and these are the remaining difficulties,” they should be left for
                    settlement, when and if they come up. So in the first meeting we put together
                    the framework of an agreement.</p>
                <p>After a few weeks, I went to Bucharest and went through the same pattern of
                    meetings with the Prime Minister, the National Security Adviser, and the
                    respective ambassadors and I delivered the Ukrainian position, just as my
                    counterpart had delivered the Romanian position in Kyiv. I said, “Doesn't this
                    look like an agreement, don't we have the agreement?” They said, “Yes, it's the
                    basis of an agreement.” “Well, then we agree.” The formal agreement was signed
                    some months later. So this was a wonderful bit of third party mediation
                    diplomacy; we had Washington permission to make the attempt and they said,
                    “Fine, do it.” In this case, our good offices worked. Anton Buteyko, the
                    ambassador of Ukraine in Romania I worked closely with on that negotiation is
                    now the deputy foreign minister in Kyiv. We saw each other frequently when he
                    was National security Adviser under Kravchuk and when he was Ambassador of
                    Ukraine in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 18th of March, 2003. Bill, let's talk
                        about Odessa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Odessa was, as you know, a city that was created in the time of Catherine
                    on very ancient indigenous roots, Odessian and certainly to some extent Greek
                    and Roman, Pontic Black Sea culture, which is different than the river cultures
                    of the major rivers. Odessa is Russian speaking. It once had a very large Jewish
                    population, as well as sizeable Greek and Bulgar and Romanian enclaves. Odessa
                    is a vibrant maritime city seated on a high prospect overlooking a big harbor
                    and the Black Sea. It is almost a Mediterranean setting. From the outset, the
                    time of Vorontsov, the founding governor, the city put a high value on culture,
                    music, and the arts. One of the charming characteristics of Odessa is the
                    remaining architecture of the early 19th century, in a very handsome classical
                    style, beautifully situated on the heights overlooking the harbor, and its docks
                    which are several hundred feet below, down the staircase that figures in the
                    Eisenstein film, The battleship Potemkin.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>When I first traveled to Odessa, it was still in great disrepair, crumbling, but
                    I suspect it had been crumbling since the beginning of the 19th century, given
                    the site of the city, whose geologic underpinnings are porous limestone. So the
                    foundations of many buildings that had collapsed were being restored and new
                    foundations built.</p>
                <p>Typical of this problem was the Opera House, a very beautiful turn-of-the-century
                    opera house, Garnier style, with magnificent acoustics, but the opera's
                    foundations were collapsing into the porous limestone underneath. Great efforts
                    are being made, and I think successfully, to shore it up. Music is everywhere,
                    in the cafes and hotels, and they had many festivals that testify to this love
                    of music. I'm sure it's partially the climate, but mostly it's the genius of the
                    population, which is inherently musical and still a great source of composition
                    and performance. Odessa produces a great many musicians for the classical
                    orchestras of Europe and the United States, even now, in its depressed
                    state.</p>
                <p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the creation of an independent
                    Ukraine the great question was how would Odessa fit into the new Ukraine, being
                    a peculiarly Russian city, a summer Russian city, where in the 19th century and
                    through the Soviet period, many Russians came from the nortMoscow, Leningrad,
                    the other cities of the north, to spend vacations along the Black Sea and to
                    promenade in Odessa, a favorite Russian city with many historic Russian
                    overtones. The adaptation was remarkably easy, partially because Odessa was left
                    to make the necessary changes in its own way. The language issue really didn't
                    cause any difficulties, and they just simply continued to speak Odessa Russian,
                    and live the normal life of Odessa.</p>
                <p>The university of Odessa, or rather the several universities of Odessa, including
                    a technical university and one that was more typical of universities with all of
                    the sciences, soft and hard, attracted good people. Their faculties were good
                    and they despite difficulties have continued. The city being the major port on
                    the Black Sea, with a beautiful harbor with magnificent facilities, began to
                    attract trade from the outside, from the countries across the Black Sea, Turkey,
                    and through the straits of the Mediterranean and from the United States.
                    Shipping was increasing rapidly, particularly from the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this basically a port for Russia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was the major southern port for the Russians. It was a tanker
                    offloading place, a major freight handling port, and there was considerable
                    military activity there, airbases and elements of the Black Sea Fleet. But the
                    real contemporary issue was how was Odessa going to fit into the new economy of
                    Ukraine? Odessa was largely left to solve this problem on its own. Odessa port,
                    and Odessa city, are very different than the surrounding region. There is a
                    long-standing conflict between the oblast and the city government, right up to
                    the top. The quarrel between the mayor and the governor began from the outset of
                    independence.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>The mayor, Hurewitz was popularly elected. The governor was selected by the
                    government in Kiev. The issue of political power concentrated in Kyiv as opposed
                    to local governance chosen by election was evident from the beginning. Both the
                    governor Bodelan and mayor Hurewitz were corrupt. They both benefited from their
                    positions, doling out favors and receiving favors in return. But the mayor had
                    more to give in the city itself, and his popularity increased, because he was
                    rather astute. He could easily have been a mayor in New York. In fact, many New
                    Yorkers of Odessan descent, you might say, would visit, and favorable trade ties
                    were made. I knew the mayor very well, as well as the governor. They visited me
                    in Kiev and I would visit them, in town and they would relate their
                    difficulties, particularly with each other.</p>
                <p>There is a very interesting American phenomenon in Odessa. The Odessa Symphony
                    Orchestra, which is probably the second-best, if not the best, orchestra in the
                    Ukraine, was led by an American conductor from Princeton, Hobart Earle. Hobart
                    is a superb musician who was in Vienna as a prot�g� of conductors there and was
                    asked to go to Odessa as a guest conductor. He went and fell in love with the
                    city. He was so charmed by the city that he married a very talented, beautiful
                    Ukrainian Russian woman from Odessa named Aida, who was a violinist, a lovely
                    woman. They had a child, Pavel. Hobart Earle is a great musician, and an
                    excellent conductor. He revived this orchestra from its near ruinous state. When
                    Earle took over there were not enough instruments for the members of the
                    orchestra to play. So he found instruments from all over the world, particularly
                    from Vienna and the United States, and rather quickly put the Odessa Symphony
                    Orchestra on a sound footing, and they're doing quite well.</p>
                <p>The Odessa Orchestra survived financially by making recordings, and supplementing
                    salaries with the income from recordings. Most second-tier orchestras are not
                    able to finance their concerts from private contributionat least not yet. The
                    Odessa Orchestra with Hobart Earle's direction has been accorded all the legal
                    status and protection that the new Ukraine can provide; it has been awarded a
                    national orchestra status, given pensions by the state for the musicians, and
                    the benefits of social protections. The orchestra has traveled quite a bit
                    throughout Ukraine and Russia and Western Europe. Their recordings are really of
                    first rate quality specializing on Russian and Ukrainian music, and some
                    American music as well. I performed there in a minor way, as the speaker in
                    Aaron Copeland's “Lincoln Portrait”. I performed in the Kyiv Opera House with
                    the same orchestra, and in a number of other cities. It was quite a wonderful
                    experience for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>Hobart Earle and Aida are good friends of ours. When they came to Kiev on
                    occasion and they would sometimes stay with us, and my wife, Suzanne and I would
                    visit them in Odessa. Odessa had made the transition from a Soviet way of life
                    to the life of an independent, cultured, non-ideological city. In Odessa, the
                    Soviet manner and style of the past has been rejected, but nothing systematic
                    has really replaced it. Certainly, ideas are floating around about what might be
                    the best way, but the real structured thinking concerns survival, survival along
                    the Black Sea, how to enjoy the life that those who live in Odessa have been
                    given, and they're tending towards, not unexpectedly, preserving the best of
                    their society, reviving the cultural life of the past and trying to provide, as
                    best as they can, for everyone. It's more evidently socialist than almost any
                    other city in Ukraine.</p>
                <p>Odessa had, for example, in the Soviet period, a very extensive athletic program,
                    as many Russian cities did, rising up to Olympic standards, where children would
                    be selected at the age of five to be athletes, would attend special schools
                    where sports were emphasized. The very best would go onto Olympic training camps
                    at the age of 20. The exceptional, the gifted students, would receive all of
                    their education in special schools, and this was true not just in athletics. It
                    was also the case with mathematics, music, dance and the arts. Those with talent
                    flourished in Odessa. There are still colonies of athletes, artists, painters,
                    sculptors, musicians, and they're still organized in “collectives”. Even if
                    they're not now formally Soviet collectives, they look on their activity in a
                    collective way, even in the symphony orchestra. It's a union now, but it really
                    is a collective of the 500 or so people that make performances possiblmusicians,
                    all of the workers, electricians, stage hands, ticket sellers, ushers, and the
                    cleaners.</p>
                <p>Athletics are still organized in the form of collectives. Collectives are found
                    in universities, museums, even in the port, certainly among the dockworkers and
                    those who go to sea on ships and manage the coastal protections of lighthouses
                    and buoys. The basic organization for professional work is still the
                    “collective”. Thoughtful Odessa leaders say, “Thank God for that, that there's
                    still some structure,” and what's missing from the Soviet system is coercion
                    through the use of force. They're working with each other as best they can. The
                    worst result of the absence of the coercive use of State force is oligarchy, but
                    the best result is collectives that are self-governing. On the negative side,
                    oligarchy is the most dramatic and most destructive expression of all of these
                    transitions from the Soviet way of life.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>There is a very interesting example of self governing collectives found in the
                    center of the city along one of the main streets of Odessa where there's a
                    children's hospital which is run by the former coach of the Olympic gymnastics
                    team of the Soviet Union. It happened that this fellow's daughter developed a
                    terrible debilitating disease as a teenager, and her career in athletics,
                    gymnastics, and her bright future, was cut short. This sad, tragic event
                    affected this coach so powerfully that he decided that he would devote his life
                    to working with children, affected as his daughter was with multiple sclerosis.
                    So he created the Odessa children's hospital, specializing in the rehabilitation
                    of youthful victims of these diseases. He achieved a very successful, a very
                    decent rehabilitation rate by any standard. His work with children was highly
                    regarded in Odessa as a great act of civic virtue.</p>
                <p>Outside of this building, on the corner of the building, about six stories above
                    the ground, there's a large bronze angel suspended as if in flight. The wings
                    are spread and flank both sides of the corner. The wings are outstretched and
                    protrude beyond the building in seeming flight. It is a very handsome,
                    extraordinary almost religious sculpture, about 12 feet in height and 12 or 15
                    feet in extension.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about the angel on the side of the
                        hospital.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: The artist who made the flying angel is one of Ukraine's best sculptors.
                    His name is Mikhail Riva, who did the fountains that we gave to the embassy
                    residence as our gift for the time of our service in Ukraine. He also did the
                    fountains and other magnificent public sculptures in Odessa. This flying angel
                    is thought to have iconic power by many Odessa inhabitants because of a dramatic
                    event that occurred at the time of the unveiling of the sculpture. A big crowd
                    was gathered at the dedication on the ground below, at the corner of the
                    building, where the entrances were. All the worthies of Odessa were there: the
                    mayor and beneficiaries and contributors were all below. This building had just
                    been restored, and just opened as a hospital and rehabilitation center for
                    children. It was not yet complete, as the workers on the roof had not finished
                    their work. At the moment of dedication a big chunk of the roof peeled off and
                    plunged toward the crown below - miraculously the outstretched wings of the
                    angel blocked the falling masonry, saving the lives of those below. The angel
                    was accorded magical power and it was understood by many to be a miracle, of
                    course. The sculpture of the angel is a very beautiful thing, and perhaps it is
                    miraculous. It certainly was in that instance.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>The coach, the director of the rehabilitation center, is a major political figure
                    in the city and so he receives contributions from the government in Kiev and
                    from Ukrainian charitable institutions such as they now arthe wife of Kuchma,
                    Ludmilla, and his daughter Elena, who work with children, have given their
                    supporand the hospital is well-financed. The hospital works because of its
                    direct lineage, in many ways, with the past. It was an easy transition from what
                    was done in the Soviet Union as charitable or as a worthy work - what was
                    worthy, even in Soviet times, is worthy now. Even the artists, who, perhaps in
                    Soviet times, were doing portraits of Lenin and Stalin and other Soviet worthies
                    are now doing paintings of angels and democratic leaders. They are able to
                    survive because they are painting and sculpting works, monuments, that are not
                    all that different from those done in Soviet times.</p>
                <p>This is a way of saying that the institutions in Odessa that were a part of the
                    normal social infrastructure in Soviet times, in modern times, in the
                    contemporary times, are also understood to be useful, and necessary. Where there
                    were existing usable institutions from the past, the transition was much easier.
                    One could go right down the line. Museums, for example. Museums were run by the
                    Soviet state. Usually, in large cities, the cities had the task of
                    administration of services, but the money, such as it existed in Soviet times,
                    came from the top, and the major social institutions received, then as now,
                    contributions that have in present times diminished. The same pattern is true of
                    schools, universities, hospitals. Even though services are now much diminished,
                    the belief that the State should provide for the social infrastructure
                    persists.</p>
                <p>Privatization first appears in what we call the service industry, labor and raw
                    materials. Odessa's economy is based on its port and its exports of raw
                    materials. There's a great amount of manual work - labor involved in the
                    handling of cargo, and the goods and services. This is where crime and
                    corruption occurs.</p>
                <p>Among the university political scientists and social philosophers in Odessa, and
                    Kiev and all the other university citiea big issues is, “what is the value of
                    labor?” In the Soviet mentality, the Soviet philosophical and doctrinal
                    thinking, labor was the highest value. It was given value according to an
                    established hierarchy of work. It was accordethis is the most mobile work, this
                    is the most mediocre. People were paid, benefits were expended, according to the
                    work that one did. For example, among the ordinary working people, not the
                    political class, the most highly paid were the drivers of children's school
                    buses and workers who labored in dangerous conditions like coal miners. They
                    were at the top of the pay scale because they had the most responsibility of
                    providing for the perceived social good and were paid accordingly.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>The new theory of labor is free-form, it's whatever you can get if you're a
                    worker or as little as you can pay if you're an owner. It was and is a scramble.
                    There were and are many aspects of it which were and are illegal, such as the
                    recording of amounts given, for tax purposes, the benefits that are supposed to
                    be paid for which are not, or are, depending on the will of the owner, the
                    nature of bookkeeping done and rigor and quality of inspection by state
                    authorities. The rules that determine the value of work are very much at issue,
                    and Odessa is a wonderful place to see all of this because it's smaller, than
                    Kyiv, about half the size. The major kinds of work in the port are very
                    compressed, into a visible small space. There are many people in Odessa who knew
                    the old system and are now running the new system and were willing and
                    interested in talking about it, because it's very much a part of their success
                    and failure, on the one hand, and very much in their thinking as leaders of the
                    country. This issue of the value of work cuts across the board in every field,
                    and it's something that we, in the West, certainly most diplomats don't usually
                    think about. I would say that it is necessary to have an understanding of this
                    kind of question, if you wanted to have an empathetic insight into what
                    motivates of leaders in countries like Ukraine and Russia. It's very, very
                    necessary to share what is inside the minds of Ukrainian leaders to begin to
                    understand why they're doing, in some cases, terrible things, in some cases
                    laudatory, generous acts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think one of the things that's always bothered Americans
                        who have gone to the Soviet Union was how poorly doctors were paid compared
                        to the United States. I mean, health care people ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's a very interesting case in point, because, as you know, the
                    majority of physicians in Ukraine are women. The women doctors do most of the
                    general health care and especially take care of women and children. The high end
                    of medicine is in research. The top physicians, in fact, were very well paid,
                    because they were on the cutting edge of medical research and technology. They
                    were the doctors in the best hospitals that took care of the leadership. They
                    were academicians. So you would find many physicians who were professors in the
                    university or in the Academy of Sciences, as scientists, when they happened to
                    be physicians. The top of the scale among what doctors were paid and their
                    benefits and their way of lifhouses and apartments that they would be givewere
                    rewards. And the same one might say, even among professions like coal miners,
                    when you were director of the coal mine, even though you had started as a pick
                    and axe man at the age of 17, if you were a director you were accorded
                    considerable honor and benefit. You were rewarded for your lifetime of work, and
                    this was the philosophical congruence with Socialist theory of labor when it was
                    justly applied. One can say that in the major categories probably it was for the
                    most part justly applied. Where it fell apart, of course, is in the Soviet
                    times, was at the top, the political class, the sort of bureaucrats, the
                    parasites, as the Soviet theoreticians called those who didn't work. They became
                    parasites themselves, the ones who invented the notion of just reward for hard
                    work of benefit to society as a whole.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>So there is a very deep, psychological struggle taking place among the
                    Ukrainians, intellectual leaders, not just thoughtful leaders in Odessa. I found
                    it throughout Ukraine in almost every field of work. You mentioned medicine, and
                    I certainly saw it there among the doctors, in their great agony about whether
                    they should open private clinics. The reason they opened the private clinics is
                    because they were fed up with the bureaucrats, not with the mission that they
                    had devoted their lives to. They blamed the bureaucrats for the collapse of the
                    supply system, for necessary medicines and spare parts for the machines in the
                    hospitalhaving enough materials and medicines to run a decent hospital. The
                    drive to privatization is as much a response to a now inadequate state
                    structure, as it is a drive to do their own thing. The collective mentality, the
                    service to the group ideis still very strong in Ukraine, much stronger than it
                    is here in the United States, even if the Soviet failure is very clear in their
                    minds. Despite the failure of the Soviet leadership, the Socialist ideal still
                    is very strong.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it is post-Soviet throughout the former Soviet Union, definitely,
                    because up until the independence, the formal independence, December 25th, 1991,
                    and the breakup of the Soviet Union, the end of the Soviet Union, the social
                    infrastructure systems worked, more or less. They worked best in Ukraine,
                    compared to other parts of the Soviet Union, for a number of reasons: Ukraine
                    had more resources, it was always a favored republic, and special attention was
                    given because of its critical, strategic importance, within the Soviet Union. A
                    sizeable proportion of the Soviet leadership was Ukrainian reflective of
                    Ukraine's importance within the Politburo and the Central Committee. Ukraine's
                    importance was seen in the amount of effort that was made to repair the damage
                    of the second World War, which was greatest in Ukraine, more than any other part
                    of the Soviet Union. Ukraine lost more lives then any other republic, on the
                    fronts in Ukraine. I was very aware of the post-Soviet political and
                    philosophical change taking place. You could witness it in the former institute
                    of philosophy which taught Marxist, Leninist, Soviet philosophy. In Kiev, the
                    Institute of Philosophy is still the main place where bright students go to
                    study philosophy, but they are now confronted with the reality of the end of the
                    Soviet Union and the necessity to deal with the emergence of a new economic
                    system, the requirement of building intellectual structures and structures for
                    daily life, and practical morality.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>So what's grown up alongside of this turmoil between Orthodox and radical new
                    thinking about the value of work, labor, contributions to society, what the
                    social structure should be, is the new new phenomenon of business, its
                    management, reflected in a great, flowering efflorescence of new western style
                    business schools and management institutes. Management for businessmen, being a
                    really Western idea, is different, very different. Its ideas about efficiencies
                    and looking at the bottom line mentalities and end results. Social purposes of
                    work done in business are not a major part of the new management thinking.
                    You're a manager, your task is to run an entity, trying to get a particular kind
                    of work done in a profitable way. How a business contributes to social well
                    being or the stability of the state, are secondary questions. So where is it
                    that a comprehensive look at the new Ukrainian society was taking place? Not
                    many places. Legitimate profit; social obligations of employers to workers; just
                    taxation; what pensions should be paid to workers by the state and by the
                    employer; what benefits are the responsibilities of the state as opposed to the
                    individual; what is a just minimum wage; what is the composition of the new
                    class system since the classless society is no more. These are the issues that
                    are now a part of the political agenda as well. Some economists have criticized
                    the Yushchenko-Tymoshenko government for populist-socialist programs and being
                    anti-free market. Not at althese issues are the heart of the political agenda.
                    For the now poverty stricken academicians, the academicians who were at the top
                    of the intellectual class and rewarded for being the best, and it's the writers
                    and poets, who were, when they were at the top of the socialist list of knowns,
                    they were in the writer's union. The best painters, were “honored artists”. The
                    best dancers, the prima donnas. The best pole vaulter, the best skaters were all
                    rewarded for excellence.</p>
                <p>New universities, like Kyiv-Mohyla, are looking at those profound problems that
                    confront the new Ukraine. Ukrainian universities have to teach their students
                    how to encompass this new world and link the new world with the old world and
                    with the history of Ukraine back to its founding and even into prehistory, and a
                    develop a convincing coherent world view. It happens that the first two
                    presidents Kravchuk and Kuchma and most of the leaders of Ukraine, up to now,
                    were in the Soviet nomenclatura, and they were dealing, even as leaders of a new
                    Ukraine, as independent Ukrainians, with a world still shaped by the Soviet
                    system, understood with a Soviet mentality, governed still by Soviet
                    hierarchical values. It is only now, as a result of the past presidential
                    election and in this next election, where you'll have leaders capable of going
                    beyond that. Yuschenko is very similar to Nicola Saakashvili in Georgia. They're
                    good friends, as it turns out. They share Ukrainian education in Kiev and
                    revolutions.</p>
                <p>I'm putting a lot stress on these issues of values because it isn't the normal
                    way of looking at Ukraine. I think it's necessary to understand this part of it,
                    that it's an unremovable part of the brain. The struggle over values explains a
                    lot of what has taken place and is taking place, and it might explain some of
                    the mysteries that confront us when we look at a country with many failed
                    expectations like Ukraine.</p>

                        your work and what you were doing vis-�-vis Washington and also

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: When you spend every day and every night with the leaders and people of
                    Ukraine, and once you get beyond the stage of formal relationships, “I'm
                    delivering you a message, you're delivering me a message,” and “This is my
                    biography, this is your biography,” then you have to have something to talk
                    about, and what I have just described about the struggle over values of work,
                    the morality of profit, social responsibility, is what they talk about. I find
                    it interesting, because it tells me at least as much about my own society, and
                    it becomes referential. You can position your own examined thinking against
                    those of others. It's a very serious, conceptual, intellectual matter.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time with a wonderful person who is a distinguished
                    psychologist, and human rights leader; his name is Simon Gluzman, who was
                    sentenced to the gulag for protesting the use of psychological pressure and
                    mind-altering drugs on political prisoners, and for charging that the Soviet
                    regime was approving of the misuse of medical practice and using a form of
                    torture in violation of human rights. For his principled stand, Gluzman was sent
                    to the gulag for seven years. He survived. Gluzman is now taking care of the
                    last thousand or so surviving Soviet era political prisoners who suffered this
                    psychological abuse. Gluzman's office is in an insane asylum attached to a
                    beautiful monastery, St. Cyril's. Gluzman is what is called a national
                    psychologist, that is, he looks at national psyche as a way of describing
                    national character and characteristics. He points out that the mentality of
                    Ukrainian leaders up to the present time is still Soviet. Gluzman asks and
                    answers the questions: what is a Soviet person? What is the Soviet mentality,
                    and whether the crossover point from Soviet mentality to something else really
                    has been reached. Even Viktor Yuschenko's origins, Gluzman points out, are in
                    the Soviet period, and his thinking was shaped in that formative period of his
                    life. Gluzman believes that it is still a major influence on Yuschenko, and that
                    Ukraine will not see the real change in the idea of freedom, of independence, of
                    individuality, on the part of its leaders for at least another generation.</p>
                <p>Ukrainians are doing considerable thinking about national identity, including
                    psychological characteristics. National identity goes way beyond language,
                    obviouslit has to do with concepts of freedom, liberty, individuality, the value
                    of work. I started with that conceptual issuthe value of work - I go back to it
                    because there's no difference between the modern period or the Soviet period:
                    the expectation in both the past and the present is that people would work, they
                    would have to work, that every individual had to work. It was part of life. So
                    if you spend eight hours a day, nine hours a day, working, you should know what
                    work is for, what its value is, and how it fits into the overall patterns of
                    life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course there's this thing of the old Soviets, the
                        saying that came out of the Soviet system, “You pretend to pay us and we
                        pretend to work.” There's an awful lot of inefficiency and absenteeism, and
                        everybody knows. .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That aphorism was a humorous description of the corruption of the system,
                    but most people worked. Most people who were on the farms, for example, even the
                    collective farms, were from peasant stock, they were conditioned through the
                    centuries to be farmers, and they worked. Most were proud of their work because
                    they not only survived the horrors of collectivization and the mass murder of
                    the Kulaks, and prospered by their work, but they also had the belief that the
                    surpluses, beyond what they needed, fed the state. There was a somewhat similar
                    pattern with the coal miners. The ideals were there. The corruption which in the
                    end destroyed the system is focused in false production figures, in swindling
                    the workers, taking benefits that the worker, who actually worked should have
                    had. The slogan, “We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us,” is of course,
                    a comic expression of a systemic corruption, but the fact that the slogan
                    describes a corruption and that the people as a whole understand that it is a
                    corruption means that there is a value that they hold as valid. There were
                    instances and places, many places, where people did their work in accord with
                    their ideals and they did it very well, and they were understood to have done it
                    well and were seen as heroes as a result.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as you're looking from your vantage poinand you

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, that's more or less the way they pronounce it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've always said “Ki-ev.”</hi>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, I'd say, in a larger sense, yes, it was a scrutiny of the post-Soviet
                    man, but the lesser issue, to be sure a secondary category, is what's the
                    difference between a Russian and Ukrainian? Is there a difference? Certainly
                    there is a difference, and it has to do with where you live, and how long you've
                    lived there and what the family histories have been through centuries, religion,
                    the nature of work, the climate, the kind of house you live in, certainly what
                    you can expect in the daily weather, even the clothes you wear. For many, many
                    centuries, there was always a distinction made, particularly, by Russians, about
                    Ukrainians. They're the “little brothers” a condescending description, meaning
                    persons who are unwashed behind the ears and provincial and country bumpkin-like
                    and not as intelligent or as accomplished as Muscovites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like the northern Italians talking about people
                        from the Mezzo General (ph).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, there are a lot of regional distinctions which are found for example
                    in Gogol's 19th century writing. There are many jokes about Ukrainians, just the
                    way jokes are made in every country about, usually, the difference between urban
                    and rural. What's changed, of course, now is that all of Europe and the world as
                    a whole is changing. The world is becoming an urban culture. Ukraine is becoming
                    an urban culture even though almost half the people still live on lanthat is, in
                    villages. It's rapidly becoming urban culture in the way that even dramatic
                    improvements in the most agricultural countries of Europe have become urban
                    cultures. That's because of dramatic improvements in transportation and
                    communications. The distance, in every way, between a city apartment and a
                    thatched cottage, is very small and continues to shrink.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about Odessa. Do people in Odessa look upon the
                        people in Kyiv as being those barbarians up there, we're the cultured folk,
                        or something of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, they do. Well, it's a little more than thaKyiv is where the
                    Ukrainian government is. They speak Ukrainian, we speak Russian. We're Black
                    Sea, and even almost Mediterranean. We have a proud imperial paseven if it is
                    over a thousand years less than Kyvian Rus.</p>
                <p>The Soviet time for Odessa was not a happy one, because of the exodus of the Jews
                    and the terrible costs of the war in Ukraine. Yes, they see differences with the
                    center but I think it's more that phenomenon of being a major city that's not
                    the capital.</p>
                <p>

                        Odessa and Marseilles have some what the same odor as far as a sea-port
                        criminality, gangs and all. Is this ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, yes, very definitely. It's an On the Waterfront atmosphere. There's a
                    lot of that feeling, and the messy corrupt politics go into city hall aw well as
                    the governors. It's a major seaport, and, as in New York, as in Boston as in
                    Seattle, Hong Kong or any major port, the world of the waterfront is, in part,
                    shaped by those who work on the docks and live off the trade and profits
                    made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the movie ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: On the Waterfront.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, excellent movie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, and I'm sure there were some Odessa elements in it. The waterfront
                    of Odessa is a rough place and that means there are gangland killings or the
                    breaking of the agreements among the criminals and the payoffs for protectioit's
                    all there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all with the New YorOdessa
                        connection? You know, criminal enforcement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I got involved because our embassy, had an FBI office. The FBI
                    office was established when I was there. Louis Freeh, came out to Kyiv and we
                    signed an agreement establishing the terms of an FBI office in Ukraine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the head of the FBI at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, FBI Director Freeh asked for my help. Among other things, he wanted
                    to really understand whether it was possible to deal with Ukrainian law
                    enforcement officials about the international aspects of the criminality that
                    appeared to come from the Ukraine. He asked if it would be better for an FBI
                    officer to come in on occasion from Germany or some other country. I said, “No,
                    I think it would be better to work directly with the law enforcement people in
                    the Ukraine. In addition, there would be a positive training aspect that the FBI
                    could give Ukrainian law enforcement agencies. It would help them measure their
                    own performance.” I had very good FBI attach�s. I had two when I was there. They
                    were both of Ukrainian ethnic background. Both spoke Ukrainian and Russian, and
                    they had both had worked at very high levels in the criminal division of the FBI
                    in Washington as well as in New York in very similar venues. So the
                    international utility of setting up FBI liaison with Ukraine on criminal
                    activity was right on the mark. It was a perfect use of an FBI attach�, because
                    it gave them real work that affected our interests and Ukrainian interests in
                    positive ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there cooperatioin other words, were the resources of
                        the FBI also made available, in certain cases, for the Ukrainians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes. It was an aspect of our aid program. It was a sensible legal
                    assistance program. It took the form of document exchange, computer integration,
                    joint communications, integration into Interpol, the international tracking of
                    criminals, and relations with other national police forces, particularly in
                    Western Europe. It was a very busy program and Louis Freeh himself took a great
                    personal interest in it, because he had been both a prosecutor and a judge, and
                    so he knew all the sides of the law enforcement. Of course, he had dealt with
                    “On the Waterfront” types and mafia, in New York and, of course, Ukraine had its
                    mafia, waterfront, and gangs.</p>
                <p>Some of the criminals in New York and other cities in the United States were of
                    Ukrainian and Russian origin. This ethnic legacy started from the end of the
                    19th century - family-ties, you might say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about overall, while you were there, corruption? How
                        did this pladid this have any concern of ours?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>MILLER: Certainly from the outset the word “corruption” was in our policy
                    rhetoric. We were against it, of course. However, the reality was we were very
                    permissive in our thinking and practice on corruption that seemed to be
                    attendant to the so-called free-market processes. This is at the top, and these
                    were the things that high officials, top level bureaucrats, would not only see
                    but possibly be able to do something abouthat is, the initial transactions of
                    evolving state assets into private assets. We, in Russia, in Ukraine and
                    throughout the former Soviet Union, I think, did not pay enough close attention
                    to the fairness of the process of translating state assets into private assets.
                    The phenomenon that developed in these countries, Ukraine and Russia foremost,
                    the rise of the oligarchs, was the consequence. The process of auctions and
                    vouchers, shares in a nonexistent markewhich were virtually worthless in the
                    beginning but obviously had legal value as far as title to ownership goes and
                    great potential valuwas badly handled. The ordinary citizen had no benefit
                    whatsoever from these processes of selling off state assets and those few with
                    fast footwork received all the benefit. Many of them, an astonishingly high
                    number, gained their wealth in criminal ways.</p>

                <p>MILLER: Could we have interfered? Yes, I think so, but privatization was also a
                    legal and philosophical struggle. Free market means for many that governments
                    don't interfere.</p>

                    relatively free ride, partially because some said this process was similar to
                    the ways wealth was accumulated in the 19th century in the United States.</p>

                <p>MILLER: That's certainly the term that was used, but as with other benefits of
                    history we knew what a robber baron was. We knew that what most robber barons
                    did was, in our system, illegal, in our system of our morality, it was immoral.
                    It was certainly unjust, but we didn't put as much rigor into this area as we
                    did into, say, the disposal of nuclear weapons. I understand why, because there
                    was a strong belief in our own country that government shouldn't interfere with
                    political economic processes, that any sort of interference would have adverse
                    effectbetter to let it take it's own course and correct itself in the future was

                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, it affected me because I was very skeptical about the so-called
                    free market because I'd seen the beginnings of this so-called free market in
                    Russia when I was living there. I didn't think the economists who were coming
                    out and preaching free market doctrine knew what the hell they were talking
                    about. They certainly didn't know anything about the country in which they were
                    making these declarations. They often referred to the Chilean example or the
                    Polish miracle, but none of these things events in other countries applied to
                    Russia or Ukraine. The regulatory balance that we have developed was not pushed.
                    The push was for disposal of state assets, privatization, as rapidly as
                    possible. For example, the biggest opportunity for money is in energy and the
                    sale and control of state assets of energy production, whether it's in the
                    extractive industries or transportation or energy generation and distribution.
                    The notion of a public utilitI never heard the word come out of the mouths of
                    our itinerant free market economists. I never heard the idea of rate regulation
                    advocated.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>MILLER: I never heard the words rate regulations, or any really serious
                    discussion in depth between our economists and Ukrainian economists and leaders
                    of what, given the nature of resources and needs in Ukraine, should be the
                    balance between the public sector and private sector. Nor did our economists
                    take seriously the argument of many Ukrainians, particularly the Socialists like
                    Olexander Moroz, that there should be a set of state assets that remained
                    national property until such time that they were fully valued. When and if such
                    assets were put up for sale, they would be sold in a fully transparent
                    competitive open-transaction. Such assets were conceived of by Moroz and others
                    as a strategic reserve, you might say. There was considerable discussions about
                    models. The Ukrainians themselves talked about these models, particularly the
                    Swedish, as ideal. The American model was beyond their reach. The German model
                    was seen as complicated by the political necessity to integrate the East into
                    the West of Germany and the tremendous costs involved in that. The new Ukrainian
                    thinkers, economists and thoughtful political leaders were searching for a
                    workable pattern to follow as they made a transition from a Soviet state to a
                    new modern Ukraine.</p>
                <p>So the question of how the value of the state, a former Soviet state, would be
                    translated into a capitalist value was never approached as a whole. I think this
                    failure to do so has had very serious consequences, because discussions on
                    economy with Ukrainian leaders were almost always limited to the immediate, the
                    questions of the size loans, terms of loan payments, adherence to certain
                    restrictions or requirements, and never, “What is all this for?” All of the
                    Ukrainian leaders had to deal with the daily struggle to keep the nation afloat.
                    The constant refrains were, “How are we going to make the payments to the IMF or
                    the World Bank or the various creditors we have on our backs?” The available
                    economic craft and ingenuity had to deal with those areas of short term concern
                    rather than long term economic vision.</p>
                <p>In part, it was an international reaction to Soviet state planning, which was an
                    anathema to most people, but the failure to find a new economic-political
                    economic vision for Ukraine proved to be a terrible lack on the Ukrainians'
                    part. It is also a failure, I think, on the part of the international financial
                    institutions and on our part as well. We were very good at providing solutions
                    to allow for debt roll-overs, and bailouts, but social consequences or long
                    range planning simply was missing beyond exhortations to reach a free market by
                    price liberalization, letting the currency float free and deregulation and
                    privatization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the universities play any role in this? Were there
                        people writing and thinking about this, or in newspapers, commenting on
                        “where are we going?” and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>MILLER: I would say very little was being seriously done in the universities.
                    Newspapers and journals commentary was focused on the daily struggles, of
                    survival and dealing with the budgetary crisis of the day. For families the
                    issue focused on, “How are we going to put food on the table tomorrow?” and
                    here's where the questions of corruption come in. “Should I take this kind of a
                    job, should I take this kind of a payment to an official to get something else?
                    If I do this, what happens?” So all of the rules and orderly expectations of the
                    past were thrown into a cocked hat, and everything became “What do I do
                    now?”</p>
                <p>The necessary actions were very pragmatic, very immediate; the broader issue of
                    social national purpose of the new politics, of the new economy was very much in
                    the background. This was a failure of leadership, clearly. This was a failure on
                    the part of the Ukrainian leadership, certainly, and, I also would say Western
                    leadership as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, when you speak of “we didn't,” you're really
                        referring to the West, aren't you.</hi>

                <p>MILLER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, not just the United States, but ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: We were the biggest donors, but all of the Europeans and Japanese were
                    involved because of their membership in the international institutions, IMF,
                    World Bank and regional banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what were we doing about promoting American
                        investment in Ukraine, and our concern about good commercial law that is the
                        cornerstone of having investment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Scale matters. If investment is really large, you can have an effect. But
                    foreign direct investment in Ukraine was and remains very small. The American
                    foreign direct investment was miniscule, given the problem, and the impact on a
                    favorable attitude of cooperation from the Ukrainian government was
                    correspondingly small. So, if a trade dispute arose and there were usually a
                    dozen or so pressing trade disputes of various kinds, such as licensing for
                    radio stations, for example, disputed ownership of a pharmaceutical company,
                    changes of board of directors manipulation, normal trade disputes you would
                    expect anywhere, there was so little overall investment that the ability to get
                    justice, so to speak, was minimal. And it took an inordinate amount of both
                    Ukrainian and American official time to deal with these questions.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>Had there been sizeable American investment, it would have been very easy to
                    settle disputes, in my view. But the initial climate in which there was a
                    clamoring to invest disappeared very quickly, and the general message on Wall
                    Street was, “You'd be a fool to invest in Ukraine. You can't rely on protection
                    either from the United States, or certainly not from Ukraine for any legitimate
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>It really is a matter of scale. The few big multinational companies that invested
                    in Ukraine did all right. The little ones were subject to influences and
                    pressures that were greater than any defense that they could bring to bear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, when you were there, what was the role of the
                        Soviet embassy? Were they trying to ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean the Russian embassy. What were your relations, and
                        was the feeling at that time that they were trying to bring Ukraine back
                        into the fold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, I made it a point to spend considerable time with the Russian
                    ambassador, the two ambassadors that were there when I was in Kyiv. The first
                    was a man named Shmolyakov, who was a Ukrainian by birth. We became good
                    friends. His wife was very pleasant, and he and his family were courteous and
                    welcome. We did a lot of things together. He was very sympathetic to Ukraine. He
                    was in an interesting position. The “near abroad” policy of Russia that Ukraine
                    should be a part of Russia was certainly something he believed in, but the
                    intensity of his Ukrainian nationalist feeling any sympathy perhaps was even
                    stronger.</p>
                <p>Our physical presence, in the form of many frequent visits by our leaders from
                    President Clinton and Vice President Gore on dowmembers of Congress, prominent
                    figures from the private world, overwhelmed anything that the Russians were
                    doing. This personal effort by our national leadership made a huge difference,
                    and we had a tremendous influence as a result. Initially, the Ukrainian
                    government was completely in congruence with us on arms control, and sort of our
                    discussions were very helpful to each other, and we did a lot together.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Yuri Dubinin was sent from Moscow to attempt to lessen American influence. There
                    was great concern in Moscow that the Americans were too influential in Kyiv,
                    that I was too influential, and that this massive personal presence of Americans
                    should be countered. Yuri Dubinin, had been ambassador here in Washington during
                    the Gorbachev perestroika era. Dubinin was a very polished diplomat, five or 10
                    years younger than Anatoly Dobrynin who had served for 23 years in Washington
                    during the Cold War. Dubinin had also served in Madrid and Paris. He was very
                    intelligent, adroit and adaptable. We were good friends in Washington. I had
                    done many exchanges of officials and prominent citizens from our respective
                    countries, things with his help when I was president of the American Committee
                    on U.S.-Soviet Relations, and when he was involved in bringing cultural groups
                    and prominent Soviet officials to the United States. I recall our working
                    together successfully to get the Donetsk Ballet troupe into the United States
                    for performances in Baltimore and Washington in the face of very complicated
                    visa and financial problems. The visit of the Donetsk Ballet was a great initial
                    success.</p>
                <p>During the time Dubinin was ambassador in Washington, Andrei Sakharov, in 1988,
                    came on his first trip to the United States after being released from exile in
                    Gorky by Gorbachev. Sakharov and his wife, Elena Bonner came for lectures at the
                    Academy of Sciences, dinner at Ted Kennedy's house and visits to the Hill. There
                    were human rights protests outside the Soviet Embassy. As I was one of the hosts
                    for his visit to the United States, Dubinin asked for my help in getting
                    Sakharov to come for a meeting at the Soviet Embassy. Dubinin was sympathetic to
                    most human rights issues, and I helped him a little bit with this awkward
                    problem of a human rights demonstration held outside his embassy to the extent
                    that I was able to persuade the blockade to be lifted so that the Sakharov
                    delegation was allowed to enter the Embassy. Dubinin and I worked together to
                    make Sakharov's trip to Washington as much a success as possible, even though
                    there were demonstrations in front of the embassy at Sakharov Plaza. In the end,
                    Sakharov agreed to go to the embassy, and in doing so greeted the demonstrators,
                    agreed with their grievances and went into the embassy which was giving a
                    reception in his honor, a wonderful complication.</p>
                <p>A few years later, I met Dubinin in Moscow when he was serving in the foreign
                    ministry and I was working as President of the International Foundation. In
                    1995, Dubinin was assigned to Kyiv. As soon as he arrived, I, of course, had a
                    dinner for him, a private dinner, and we fully discussed our separate purposes
                    and came to a clear understanding of what our mutual purposes were. Having
                    Dubinin sent to Kyiv was helpful, to me. Because of our personal friendship, I
                    may have blunted what he might have done if someone else were ambassador.
                    Because we were friends, and he never used any of the harsh language that Soviet
                    ambassadors tend to use, and he would never do anything affecting our official
                    relations without telling me first, if it might have an impact on our personal
                    relationship. I think this is proof of how valuable it is to know people well as
                    human beings, even those who hold opposing views over the years. If you have a
                    decent human relationship, you can get far more done.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>For me, the Russian factor was manageable. I went to Moscow on occasion, to see
                    friends, and many of them were the authors and proponents of the near abroad
                    policy in the Russian policy world. I think that kind of involvement, as with
                    Ambassador Dubinin, softened what they might have been able to do otherwise. It
                    certainly gave me an understanding of what they had in mind, what their
                    long-term interests were. They haven't changed. They believe Ukraine should be a
                    part of Russia. As good friends as they are on a personal plane, they very much
                    regretted my role in Ukraine and told me so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, the NATO issue is very important. The initial thinking of most
                    Ukrainian politicians, between 1991995 was that the Warsaw Pact was finished,
                    let's get rid of that. OSCE is the right framework for a new European security
                    organization. It puts everyone on the same starting point, with decent values,
                    agreed human rights, none of the formal legacy of the horrible past, elimination
                    of a fear of military invasion or intervention. The OSCE option was rejected by
                    the West. How to recast NATO for the post Cold War world became our
                    introspection as a political and policy matter in Washington and throughout the
                    West. Should NATO disband or should we expand? This was the debate from '93 to
                    '95. Before the decision to expand NATO to the East was made, as an interim
                    measure, Partnership for Peace, a Clinton invention, a Bill Perry invention, was
                    created to provide an active means of working together with states from the
                    former Warsaw Pact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The secretary of defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Partnership for Peace made eminent sense, and worked very well,
                    because it allowed each country to do its own thing, at its own pace, without
                    putting a great strain on their capabilities. They could come in to a viable
                    security arrangement right away, which Partnership for Peace was, without the
                    requirements of NATO membership that were imposed on the Western European
                    nations. But the idea of a new security partnership was the focus of serious
                    security discussions, “What is the meaning of partnership?” And this idea of
                    partnership was running concomitant to “What is NATO?” NATO was no longer forces
                    assembled for a massive war of armies on the north German plain, because there
                    are no forces on the other side. If NATO is dissolved, what are we going to do
                    with 20 tank divisions of main battle tanks, and 20 infantry divisions, what
                    about U.S. basing in Germany? Where should forces be deployed, for what purposes
                    and what kinds of forces? So there was a huge debate in Brussels, particularly,
                    and in all the capitals of the West. Of course the bureaucracy of Brussels
                    wanted to continue NATO. It was their life's work. They weren't sure that Russia
                    would remain a weak power and that it wouldn't become once again a power with
                    imperial ambitions and become once again a threat to the West and world
                    peace.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>“The keep NATO and expand it” point of view triumphed in 1995. “We will keep the
                    core because we can't trust the Russians, and we'll expand, certainly, to
                    include Poland and Czechia. We'll bring the border right up to the old Soviet
                    Union. We'll absorb Warsaw Pact.” So that was the '95 decision.</p>
                <p>The formal new structure for European security was defined by the reaction of
                    NATO, the EU, and OSCE to Yugoslavia's disintegration. Even though Yugoslavia
                    was certainly an all-European issue, the decision about activities to deal with
                    Yugoslavia were made in Brussels, Paris, London, Washington and other Western
                    European capitals. The views of Moscow, Ukraine, and all the other former Warsaw
                    Pact states, were not taken into account. It was very clear that NATO was to be
                    the military basis for post Cold War European security, and that NATO would
                    extend to the east as conditions would permit, but that the core would remain
                    such that the United States would be the dominant military power and the
                    decisions would be made in the same way that they were made in the time of the
                    Cold War.</p>
                <p>On the issue of Yugoslavia, Ukraine was left outside of the debate in Brussels,
                    since Ukraine was not a full partner. They were active members of Partnership
                    for Peace and they had very good representation in that forum. Boris Tarasyuk
                    went to Brussels and fought the fight, but he was always seen as an outsider,
                    not in the in-group, and noisy and irritating because he kept bringing up the
                    issue. He had the portfolio as ambassador to Belgium and to NATO. I can remember
                    very well, having gone to Brussels several times, and to Germany to discuss this
                    with Richard Holbrooke who was ambassador in Bonn. Holbrooke was a major player,
                    as was Bob Hunter, our NATO ambassador in Brussels. They both came to Kyiv for
                    meetings with me and appropriate Ukrainian officials. Of course, Bill Perry and
                    Strobe Talbott were involved. Where did Ukraine fit in all of this? The answer
                    was that Ukraine was an important entity formally outside of NATO that
                    strategically should be inside of NATO but nonetheless was outside, largely
                    because NATO had to deal with another strategic nation, even more important,
                    Russia. What kind of a “partner” was Russia? The adjectives used to describe
                    what kind of partner Russia and Ukraine were the substantive surface of a huge
                    policy fight.</p>
                <p>How many strategic partners can you have and still be strategic? How many
                    “partners” have a “special relationship” and have it still be special? How many
                    countries can be special? The wordsmiths went from “special” to “unique”. The
                    hunt for appropriate adjectives, I found, was a bit pathetic and demeaning. The
                    hunt was really an evasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any thought in thinking about the Russian
                        menace to keeping NATO together, I've always felt that one of the prime
                        things to NATO was particularly keeping the French and Germans under the
                        same tent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: That was an old issue. That became old stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may be old stuff, but old stuff becomes quite new
                        stuff. I would think that within the European context, they would be in a
                        way happy to sort of keep almost the armed forces under control, so that
                        they didn't start looking over each other's shoulders and saying, “Gee,
                        they're getting a little bigger than me and all.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the French question, from de Gaulle on was the French were not
                    participants in NATO, even though they were members in NATO, an irony. The whole
                    issue of whether there should be a European force, without the Americans, this
                    is another aspect of the debate, but it's out here. The main actions in security
                    took place in the core NATO context, led by the United States, the Yugoslavian
                    action group determined by us. How these other countriefor example, Ukraine had
                    views about how to handle the Yugoslavs, because they had extensive dealings
                    with them in Soviet times. They knew each other as fellow slaves. Ukraine and
                    the Yugoslavs had extensive trade with each other, down the Danube. This was a
                    rocky time for Ukrainian-American relations, because Ukrainian views were not
                    taken into account. The discussions didn't involve them, and Ukraine didn't like
                    the actions that were taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One, were they coming to you and saying, “Make us a
                        player,” or were you going to Washington and saying, “Make them a
                        player?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, much of this happened after I left, but yes, they would come to me
                    and say, “This is contrary to our efforts to become a part of NATO and Europe.
                    It doesn't help.” The most significant effect of the Yugoslav action was that it
                    isolated Kuchma, who wanted to continue the policy of non-alignment, of
                    straddling, of appearing to be going Westward gradually, but maintaining good
                    relations with Russia, doing nothing that would damage the good relations with
                    Russia. Kuchma had accepted the idea of moving steadily in the direction of the
                    West taking formal steps as they were ready. Ukrainian leaders loved Partnership
                    for Peace, because it was a form of inclusion that allowed Ukraine to proceed
                    with confidence at its own pace.</p>
                <p>We lost interest in the Partnership for Peace, because we were preoccupied with
                    Yugoslavia and the attempted NATO actions. Brussels then made the decision to
                    expand and set the standards of membership at the level of Polish and Czech
                    political maturity. That was the early standard in the NATO that was now seen as
                    correct. At this point, we lessened and almost stopped the highest-level
                    contacts between the United States and the Ukraine. We really cut them off.
                    President Clinton, once he got into his impeachment difficulties, during his
                    last year in office, was occupied defending himself. Clinton, sadly, dropped out
                    of his pattern of actionism and it hurt terribly.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>At the same time, as this break in high level contacts, there was also a breaking
                    away from Western models, and restrictions. This break between Kuchma and the
                    United States was very much in the interest of the oligarchs who were gaining
                    political control. Ukraine was near the head of the list to enter NATO in 1991;
                    it certainly would have been put on the list in 1996 if they had pressed
                    publicly for it, and if we had pushed them to push. But we convinced ourselves
                    that Partnership for Peace was the right way to get Ukraine into NATO. It was
                    working very well from a military point of view, the integration process was
                    proceeding very effectively, the pressures on the Ukrainians weren't so great
                    that it created anxiety and the United States could handle the training burden.
                    And then Partnership for Peace was all but set aside.</p>
                <p>We didn't stay the course, so to speak, on an agreed process that was working
                    very well. I don't think we were sensitive to the Ukrainians' constant necessity
                    to look over its shoulder to Moscow enough to get through that mine field. As it
                    happens, first Yeltsin and then Putin later moved closer to NATO than Ukraine,
                    and Russia became directly influential in NATO affairs in Brussels, because
                    Russia had to be included. Russia was the political threat problem, and insofar
                    as they wanted to be part of the solution, they'd have to be involved. They were
                    and are in an ideal position to deal with NATO. Ukraine is not a threat and does
                    not have a similar kind of influence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this probably is a good place to stop. Have

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, let's do that.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 25th of March, 2004. Kuchma?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Kuchma is a very good person to focus upon because he represents the
                    essence of the Ukrainian party of power, he is the inheritor from the Soviet
                    system, the top of the nomenclatura of the Soviet system, even in the new world
                    of an independent Ukraine. And he's an interesting figure in his own right as a
                    Soviet man. He came from a village northeast of Kyiv, in the historic Cossack
                    area. His mother, when I first met him, still lived there in the village of his
                    birth. The village which I visited is a Ukrainian and Russian ethnic mix.</p>
                <p>Kuchma comes from a village and rises in the ranks of the party as an engineer.
                    He goes to Dnepropetrovsk, the university there, and gets a degree, goes into
                    the Dnepropetrovsk complex of missile factories, particularly Pavlograd, which
                    was the number one missile factory of the Soviet Union and the largest
                    missile-producing factory in the world, manufacturing 250 ICBMs a year. Kuchma
                    ran the missile making plant as commissar. He wasn't the leading engineer, he
                    was its party leader. He was the political leader of the complex of Pavlograd.
                    The collective, so to speak, was under his command.</p>
                <p>Kuchma is an excellent example of how valued in the Soviet system the
                    organization of work, high-tech work, the achievement of goals in the Soviet
                    manner was. His rise in rank was in strict accord to contributions to the party.
                    Kuchma is a perfect example of the Soviet system. When Ukraine became
                    independent, the membership of the first parliament and the structure of the
                    first government was very similar to what was going on in Ukraine in the Soviet
                    period at the end. So in the first election after independence, a popular
                    election, Kuchma is elected to the first parliament as one of the natural
                    leaders. Kuchma is chosen prime minister after the ranking Soviet economist, who
                    had been in the Gosplan in Moscow, Masol, is voted out.</p>
                <p>The first government, and most of the first parliament, are from the Party of
                    Power of the Soviet system, even though all of them, with very few exceptions,
                    are Ukrainian nationalists. Those who are democrats in the parliament are in the
                    minority. The democrats did not achieve a popular electoral majority until 2002,
                    when the parliamentary elections produced a majority that was in support of
                    democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say democrats and nationalists, do you
                        differentiate between the two?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>MILLER: Well, the nationalists are those who support the idea of Ukrainian
                    territorial integrity, sovereignty and identity. Ukrainian nationalist include
                    hard-line Communists as well as liberal constitutionalists and those who believe
                    in the rule of law in the Western sense. There are Ukrainian nationalists who
                    are ultras and hold a kind of monarchist view. What they all shared, all
                    Ukrainian nationalists, with very few exceptions, what they all shared in 1991,
                    '92, and '93 was the goal of independence from Moscow. Also, they supported the
                    idea of non violence. Of course, they all said they wanted a peaceful life and
                    positive change from the old system, even though Soviet Ukraine for the most
                    part had achieved a stability after all of the terrible wars, world wars, civil
                    wars, famines, and the gulag. Ukraine was settling into a kind of Soviet
                    prosperity when the change and collapse of the Soviet Union took place in
                    1991.</p>
                <p>A substantial minority, of the Soviet government in Moscow was composed of
                    Ukrainians particularly from the Khrushchev period on. About 40 percent of the
                    top leadership were Ukrainian. This was also true in the military leadership. A
                    substantial minority in the security forces of KGB, the economists, every part
                    of Soviet life had a substantial Ukrainian component, that is, people of
                    Ukrainian origin. So they were part and parcel of the Soviet system that existed
                    at the end of the '80s, beginning of the '90s. Kuchma was an example par
                    excellence of the Soviet system: village boy, young pioneer, Komsomol, engineer,
                    working for the nation, for the Soviet Union, succeeding and climbing step by
                    step to the top of the heap in the military-industrial complex. So he was
                    respected, a man of proven talent, not outspoken, not dynamic, but he was
                    someone the Ukrainian people thought who would have the needed experience and
                    stability.</p>
                <p>Kuchma was prime minister for a relatively short time, but then resigned under
                    the pressure of economic crisis. The collapse of the Soviet economic system had
                    terrible effect on all Ukrainians. The collapse, which included hyper-inflation
                    of over 10,000 percent, reduced the wellbeing of Soviet citizens, within a year
                    or two, to 40 percent of the level that they were living under at the end of the
                    Soviet Union. This trough, this collapse, lasted for several years. The economy
                    began to climb upward after 1998, but has not yet approached the levels of
                    1991.</p>

                <p>Kuchma was one of the Ukrainian leaders that were known to the public as a whole,
                    known to be Ukrainian, also known to be a top of the heap Soviet leader, and as
                    a result, he was seen as a natural leader in the transition democratically
                    elected parliament. He was also termed one of the “Red directors”, this class of
                    people who managed the major industries and factories of Ukraine. “Red
                    directors” was a term used throughout the Soviet Union, describing the managers
                    of the military-industrial complex. They were a very powerful group. They
                    organized themselves into a lobby, something like the National Association of
                    Manufacturers here, the NAM. They called themselves the Association of
                    Entrepreneurs. By using a bourgeois word like “entrepreneur”, they softened the
                    Soviet image the “Red directors” had. The “Red directors”, were, in fact, in the
                    process of taking over ownership of the Soviet plants for themselves. The “Red
                    directors” were the new group of leaders of the new economy. It is in that role
                    that I first med Kuchma, as the president of the Association of Entrepreneurin
                    his very elaborate office on Kreshatik, the main street of Kyiv. I was impressed
                    with his very bright staff of former Komsomol leaders, including Dmitro
                    Tabachnyk who became his chief of staff, and a number of others who also were
                    his key staff aides when Kuchma became president.</p>
                <p>The Association of Entrepreneurs was an outgrowth of Soviet economic leaders who
                    in the new Ukraine, post Soviet Ukraine, was advancing the interests of the red
                    directors. This group of red directors became the most powerful Ukrainian
                    political group, both behind the scenes and of record from 1991 through, I'd
                    say, about 1997, when the oligarchs took over the leadership. Some oligarchs
                    were former red directors, but the new era, capitalist oligarchs as a whole are
                    characterized by having far more experience and use of, the new economy and
                    banks. The oligarchs created new networks of banks and other economic
                    institutions, to support the acquisition of further assets. The oligarchs'
                    objective was personal wealth accumulation. The oligarchs concentrated to great
                    effect, accumulating money by acquiring state assets and using that first level
                    of acquisition as leverage to make even more money.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that money going anywhere else, or to Swiss bank
                        accounts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, it was going wherever money would produce the most return. They were
                    bright, and informed themselves about where to go to the place where they would
                    get the most money, particularly for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not a matter of reinvestment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: It was not reinvestment, it was self aggrandizement.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: How ready the red directors were when they became oligarchs, to shed the
                    Soviet legacy of support for workers. They shed the burden of infrastructure
                    support for workerthe hospitals, the kindergartens, the schools, the cultural
                    centers, social infrastructure, the part of the typical Soviet industrial
                    complex, which included the building and maintenance of apartment houses,
                    playgrounds, movie theaters, clinics. The work place took care of its workers
                    from birth to death, including burials. The Soviet place of work provided that
                    kind of all-inclusive security. With a new “free market” system they shed those
                    obligations and became bottom line efficient and left the workers adrift. These
                    features of economic transition, accounts for some of the discontent on the part
                    of most Ukrainians.</p>
                <p>Let's return to Kuchma. Kuchma, as the president of the red directors Association
                    of Entrepreneurs, used that as platform for his political base. It was his
                    political base. In 1994, he ran for president against Kravchuk, Leonid Kravchuk,
                    the first president who had been a second-level nomenclatura. Kuchma had been
                    higher in Soviet rank and higher in the esteem of the populace than Kravchuk,
                    and this Soviet qualitative difference had an effect on the outcome of the
                    elections. Also, Kravchuk was a decided and overt Ukrainian language
                    nationalist, whereas Kuchma was Russian-speaking, although a nominal, reluctant
                    nationalist. The demography of Ukraine is such that the greatest proportion of
                    the population is in the east, and Kuchma, coming from Dnipropetrovs'k, one of
                    the major cities of the east, the Russian-speaking east, was able to command
                    their support. Even so, Kravchuk would have won reelection, if he had not been
                    ambivalent. Until a few months before the elections, he was saying, “I will run,
                    I won't run,” and when he finally decided to run it was too late. The key votes
                    had already been decided upon, and Kravchuk lost.</p>
                <p>So Kuchma, as presidenthis is when I really got to know him, because he
                    understood, from the outset, that his most important foreign relationship was
                    with Americans and the United States. His ties with Moscow were well-established
                    and those ties would not be difficult to maintain, but he had to make a stable,
                    workable arrangement with the United States in order to succeed as president. He
                    understood that right away. So we spent a lot of time together, in part because
                    it was his desire to make clear that he wanted to have good relations with the
                    United States, and correspondingly, we made it very clear that we wanted to have
                    good relations with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was in it for him to have theswhy was it so
                        important for him to have good relations with the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>MILLER: Having made the decision to eliminate nuclear weaponand Kuchma was a
                    positive force in the making of that decision, because his judgment from a
                    technical point of view was that it made no sense for Ukraine to keep its
                    nuclear arsenal, that the expense and the strategic utility brought Ukraine no
                    benefit, making a deal with the United States for eliminating the nuclear
                    arsenal, in return for supporeconomic, political and what Ukrainians call moral
                    supporwas the most important objective. He was very important, even decisive, in
                    the Ukrainian national decision to eliminate nuclear weapons. My discussions
                    with him about this, before he was president, when Kravchuk was still president
                    and they were still negotiating with us, and among themselves, centered on the
                    terms of the deal they would put forward on nuclear weapons. It was very clear
                    that the quid pro quo for giving up nuclear weapons was sustained support,
                    economic and political, for the foreseeable future. He understood what had to be
                    done to get that, which was to have close contact with us.</p>
                <p>This desire on Kuchma's part was made easy because the United States government
                    policy was to foster close contact with him and to develop the closest possible
                    relationship with his government. It was the policy of President Clinton and
                    Vice President Gore, and all of the relevant Cabinet ministers, and Secretaries.
                    They all put in the time and effort to make it work. So the basis of my constant
                    contact with Kuchma was on two levels. The first was that he wanted to discuss,
                    in detail, the nature of this new relationship, and secondly, he had to deal
                    with the constant visits to Kyiv and Ukraine by high-ranking Americans, from the
                    president on down, and his trips to the United States with his government, to
                    Washington and the United States. So it was a time of sustained intense activity
                    at the highest level.</p>
                <p>I saw quite a bit of him in an official way, in his offices in Bankova, which is
                    the name of the street near the president's office. I got to know him well and
                    Ludmilla, his wife, and his daughter, OlenI played tennis with his daughter. I
                    saw him in his dachas in Crimea. We saw a lot of each other. I had a good sense
                    of what kind of life he was leading, and what his thinking was. His intellect
                    was such that he was excellent at managing day-to-day crises. He could handle
                    the details of the immediate politics of balancing one faction with another, and
                    the economic issues of the moment. He also demonstrated that he had no vision
                    for the future. I think his sense of dutand he did have a sense of dutwas one
                    that was thrust upon him. His role was not one that he would have preferred. I
                    think clearly he preferred the Soviet system, but he understood very clearly
                    that the Soviet era was over, that there was no retur“no way back,” as he would
                    say with a deep sigh. “There is no way back. We have to accept our fate and go
                    forward.”</p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>For him, it was a nostalgic, deeply nostalgic moment, whenever he discussed or
                    approached basically anything that was high-tech. During our one official visit
                    to the United States to meet President Clinton, we together went down to Cape
                    Canaveral to witness a shuttle launch. The shuttle crew included a Ukrainian
                    astronaut, so we went through the rocket facilities at Cape Canaveral, as we had
                    earlier in Greenbelt, Maryland, at NASA (National Aeronautics and Space
                    Administration). It was very evident that he knew every technical aspect. He
                    even seemed to drink it in. He and Volodymyr Horbulin, then national security
                    advisor, and long-time friend, his chief assistanhe was also from the rocket
                    factory at Pavlograd, whenever we'd go by one of our big rockets they'd look it
                    over very carefully, pat the rocket here and there and then stand back and say,
                    “We do it differently. In fact, ours have more thrust and are much simpler”
                    (this was true) “And of course, much cheaper and we can get more payload.” Then
                    there'd be a deep sigh. I heard him say, “Oh?I'll never be able to return to
                    that. I'm stuck with the job of being president of this new independent country
                    where my heart is really in building rockets.” The incident revealed a very
                    human side to Kuchma - “my occupation gone...” in the manner of Othello. That
                    was about as deeply reflective as he could get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm kind of getting the atmosphere of this time, I mean,
                        looking at it from a non-knowledgeable point of view, as just a Foreign
                        Service officer, I always felt that the Ukrainas long as the Ukraine was
                        independent and truly independent, this basically stopped Russia from
                        getting too powerful or messing around or being ugly. But I was wondering
                        how, say, the Ukrainiandid they see that getting close to us kept the
                        Russian bear out of their backyard or did they use Russia to extract stuff
                        from us? What was their outlook on this, and was our outlook as I described
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, as you described it, the fear of Ukraine becoming a part of the
                    Russian bear again was certainly part of our thinking. I think, in my own view,
                    now, that that was an error. Certainly it was the danger from the past, it was
                    not a realistic danger of the present. The issues of governance are very
                    different, very different; and the idea of a primitive Slavic nation being a
                    threat to the rest of the world, of marching across the north German plain and
                    so on is a fearful notion of the past no longer relevant. The issues are so very
                    different now, even though our strategic thinking is still premised on those
                    past fears.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>What are the real issues? I could see them emerging in Kuchma's thinking, in his
                    behavior and his expressed thought when his thoughts were turned into actions.
                    The issue really was how can a country of great accomplishment, given the Soviet
                    framework of the recent pashow far Ukraine had come in the last century with all
                    of the horrohow they could keep going in a way that would bring adequate
                    prosperity and a decent life to the people. When independence fell into their
                    laps, and there was a necessity to enter into a new political economic and
                    social system that had very little regard for the well-being of the people? The
                    theoretical nature of the new free market economy, theoretically laid out, was
                    to get the most reward for investment, and that reward may or may not include
                    the well-being of people. The idea of shaping an economy for a national social
                    purpose is contrary to pure capitalism, which is benefit for the individual,
                    whether it's a corporate entity, or one person. The notion of benefits for a
                    group, the state, the city or the town was not the first requirement, was not
                    the bottom line. Such social consequences may be a charitable deduction later,
                    but it's not the main purpose of a free market economy.</p>
                <p>I think this conceptual problem of who should benefit from work weighs heavily in
                    the minds of a few thoughtful individuals. In the past, the soviet past, esteem
                    or merit was seen by themselves and the people they served was measured by the
                    degree to which these managers were working for the people. As it has turned
                    out, almost none of them were working for the people. They're a pretty rotten
                    lot, from the point of view of what they once held to be the highest ideals.</p>
                <p>Kuchma was in the middle of this crisis of belief, and because he has always been
                    a person of the system, not a creator of the system, it's very hard for him to
                    lead. He could manage simply go day-to-day in the circumstances that surrounded
                    him. He was adrift in the sea beyond this daily perspective. Kuchma was not able
                    to chart any course except that necessary to keep the ship afloat. His
                    surroundings, his colleagues, his friends, the people who clung to him and
                    enveloped him, and insulated him from everyone else, they, the inside group,
                    benefited. The circle that surrounded him made sure, that Kuchma benefited, and
                    that what they gave Kuchma in the way of benefits trapped him. The circle of
                    power was self-reinforcing. There were one or two exceptions, and they, in the
                    end, were driven out of the circle. I'd say the key exception, who would
                    constantly try to bring Kuchma back to the realities that he had to deal with,
                    was Horbulin, and even he, his closest friend from the earliest days in
                    Dnipropetrovs'k, as students, was driven out, because he was pointing out the
                    depth of the corruption of the circle and Kuchma himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>I could see the corruption taking place, and I talked about it with Kuchma. The
                    ways in which I could talk about this very difficult subject had to do with
                    solemn agreements, contracts, that were misused or set aside because of the
                    greed of the inner group. I pointed out that the corruption had become a matter
                    of public comment and deep revulsion, among the public. There was great distaste
                    about how much the inner circle was stealing. We discussed how this corruption
                    could be stopped. I used the metaphor during the last two years I was there with
                    him, about drawing a line in the sand and saying to the people of his country
                    and to the corrupt circle, “We have to stop this corruption. Whatever was stolen
                    before that is in the past, but we'll move forward in a different way.” I
                    emphasized that Kuchma needed, Ukraine needed, to make the distinction between
                    the struggles and illegal activities of the early transition and go on now in a
                    clean way. “Clean” meaning, in Ukrainian terms, what was acceptable political
                    and economic behavior. He understood the nature of the discussion. He was too
                    weak in character to take such a bold step, and, I think Kuchma believed that he
                    could somehow ride it out. I'm afraid that, by 1997, he was so trapped by the
                    enormity of the corruption that he couldn't get out.</p>
                <p>In many ways I was sorry to see this disintegration because Kuchma's inability to
                    get out from this circle of thieves, politely expressed, accompanied his
                    increasing drunkenness. He was almost like Yeltsin in that respect, and became
                    increasingly more difficult. Further, our high level involvement dropped off.
                    President Clinton became involved with his own problems so he was not able to
                    continue his positive influence on Kuchma's behavior. Gore and the other senior
                    cabinet members also were involved in holding the Clinton administration
                    together. So Kuchma was left to his own fate.</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>As a human being, Kuchma was far from the most admirable among the Ukrainians,
                    but he was an interesting person and he always accorded me great respect, and,
                    of course, access. We did a lot of good things together, I would say, when he
                    was very clear on a formal basis that both nations were intensely interested and
                    involved, and when he understood that it was necessary, for his interests, to
                    keep the dialogue and relationship going with the Americans. He was one of those
                    people, who, I think, needs to have constant engagement, that is, I had to meet
                    him constantly to keep progress on agreed goals going. What I have just
                    described is evidence that an ambassador has great value, simply as a human
                    presence, if he can keep the discussions going on the goals that both sides
                    agree are important. There's no substitute for it. The difficulty my successors
                    had with Kuchma is that that access to him was severely constrained. Why? I
                    would say that first, it was due to his physical and moral disintegration and
                    change of character and behavior, second, his circle of advisors succeeded in
                    building barriers to keep him isolated, and third, it is also partially due to
                    our change of policy. President Bush is not personally interested in the work of
                    engagemenin fact, some in his policy group believe that engagement is somehow
                    not a worthy tool of governance. So there's a great drawback for an ambassador
                    if engagement at the highest levels is not an option. A good part of the agenda
                    is negativthat is, what discussion there is, is largely dealing with mutual
                    problems and complaints. The ambassador has to go with an array of demarches
                    about some abuse or horror or dispute, which doesn't make for ameliorating
                    friendships. As professionals, Kuchma and I got along quite well. It helps if
                    you can call up the president and say, “I'd like to see you,” and be able to do
                    it.</p>
                <p>Kuchma's biggest failing, I'd say, was that he did not prepare for his successor.
                    I don't think he had any idea of what kind of successor would best benefit
                    Ukraine. He was really judging who best from among the inner group should
                    succeed him, many of whom were toadies and miscreants of one kind or
                    another.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: ChernobyUkraine and Chernobyl were seen as part of the same problem. They
                    were an identity, and when I first went out, in fact, many of my friends said,
                    “Oh, you're going to Chernobyl. You're going to be radiated.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “You'll glow when you come home.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0257" n="Page0257"/>
                <p>MILLER: “You'll glow, and your life will be shortened by decades.” Kyiv was
                    thought to be a place to be avoided by Foreign Service people because of the
                    extraordinary hardships and dangers. The hardships were the lack of decent
                    housing, commissaries, or locally available food. There was the danger of
                    radiation from Chernobyl. There was no fuel; it was cold, and politically it was
                    the great unknown. So the people who volunteered, so to speak, who wanted to go
                    to Kyiv, tended to be Diaspora Americans, and those who knew the Soviet Union
                    and knew what a beautiful city Kyiv was, and those who had a sense of adventure,
                    who saw the Foreign Service as adventure and a chance to do something new and
                    creative, which an assignment to Ukraine was.</p>
                <p>So the Chernobyl effect was in the end a positive weeding out process for us. I
                    had the best, the most courageous and innovative staff as a result. Chernobyl
                    was certainly constantly in the minds of Ukrainians because a good portion of
                    the Ukrainian population was irradiated by the nuclear cloud, and a very
                    substantial proportion of the population was involved in the evacuation of all
                    of the people from the villages from around Chernobyl, to a radius of 50 miles
                    out from the reactor explosive site. All of the nation was involved in taking in
                    the refuges of Chernobyl, and they had to build housing for the displaced and
                    hospitals for the cancer victims. It was a great burden on the country. In fact,
                    one of the largest continuing budget items was Chernobyl, payments to the
                    victims and costs for hospitals and remedial requirements which will stretch out
                    for several generations.</p>
                <p>Chernobyl was very much a part of the mindset when I arrived in 1993. The fear of
                    eating contaminated food was such that we were all given dosimeters, Geiger
                    counters, to test our food that was bought in the markets and to wave it at your
                    furniture and the air, you were breathing the ambient radioactive circumstances.
                    These ever present dangers became a sort of morbid joke and after a while, once
                    you were there, the whole sense of danger dissipated. But for Ukrainians,
                    Chernobyl is a constant reminder of technology gone awry. Chernobyl is one of
                    the major reasons, I believe, that the Ukrainians felt deeply about the
                    necessity to eliminate nuclear weapons. It was a major factor in their
                    mentality. For them, help from others in dealing with this problem was a test of
                    friendship and this was a very important diplomatic lesson for me. They asked
                    for help, we said we would give the requested help. This request for help was
                    made to the West, generally, and the United States in particular. We had several
                    pledge conferences to raise the funds necessary. I can remember one held at the
                    Waldorf in New York in 1995, it was a spin-off from an official visit of
                    Ukrainians to Washington. Vice President Al Gore was chairman of this meeting,
                    and the EU nations and Japan and a number of others and the United States, of
                    course, pledged money for repair of the Chernobyl sarcophagus, the tomb that had
                    been put around the blown-up reactor. We pledged ourselves to meet the need.
                    Thus far, we haven't yet met our pledge. This failure to honor such a solemn
                    commitment has damaged the Ukrainian view of the integrity of our work.</p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>The Ukrainians' sense of abandonment and fear of being cut adrift was reinforced
                    by this failure. It is a reminder to me, as a diplomat and sometime policymaker,
                    that when you make these kinds of commitments you've got live up to them. We
                    said we would do the job. To Gore's credit, to the Clinton administration's
                    credit, they worked mightily to try and meet that, but they didn't fully. It
                    underlines the necessity of transition groups to convey the understanding
                    necessary to make clear obligations that a new administration has to honor past
                    commitments. You can't destroy treaties because you find them inconvenient. You
                    pick up the burdens that you inherit, as odious or difficult as they may be.
                    Chernobyl is one of those things that has not been satisfactorily met in the
                    minds of the Ukrainians. So I would say any ambassador that goes out to Kyiv,
                    any Assistant Secretary for European affairs, any national security council
                    advisor should be made fully aware of the Chernobyl burden that stems from 1986.
                    Every Ukrainian has a memory of it, every Ukrainian has had a relative somehow
                    affected, either directly by radiation or death, so it's a constant in their
                    mentality. I understood that it was very important for me to go to Chernobyl,
                    and I went frequently. So I shared their understanding of these things and they
                    had, of course, ceremonial days the way the Japanese do at Hiroshima about
                    Chernobyl. It is very important for an ambassador and embassy staff to
                    participate in solemn ceremonies like commemoration of Chernobyl, the famine, or
                    the slaughter of Babyn Yar or the sacrifice in the war against the Nazis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Ninety-eight.</p>

                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>MILLER: I haven't stopped my interest in Ukraine, largely because of what I've
                    been doing at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, first as a policy fellow
                    and now as a senior fellow. When I went to the Wilson Center it was for a year,
                    to work on a book on the Ukraine, which I'm still working on. I hope to finish
                    this year. The Wilson Center is a base for me to go back to Ukraine and to
                    continue to work with my friends and groups that I felt were worthy. I have
                    institutional connections which are natural, I suppose. Suzanne and I had a
                    great interest in the opera house, the ballet, and music, and we've continued
                    that by going to a fair number of performances to see our friends who are still
                    dancing, singing, conducting, playing. We've supported them in various ways by
                    helping them come here. In addition to our continuing interest in the opera
                    house, I'm on the board of the Kyiv Mohyla university foundation. Kyiv Mohyla is
                    a modern liberal arts university, post-Soviet, even though its origins were in
                    the 17th century. Kyiv Mohyla brings me in direct contact with the teaching of
                    the youth and the Ukrainian youth themselves. I'm also on the board of an
                    archaeological museum dig at Chersonesus in Crimea, an archeological site,
                    Greek-Byzantine-Roman-Russian and prehistoric. It's a great archeological site
                    in a beautiful part of the world. There's a lot that brings me back to the
                    Ukraine.</p>
                <p>The person who is now running for president, and I hope will be president, Viktor
                    Yuschenko, is a close friend from my earliest days in Ukraine. So all the
                    democratic groups were people that I knew very well and liked and I do what I
                    can to help them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say the democratic groups, I mean, these are basically
                        groups that are trying to break away from this court ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: From the party of power, from the Soviet times. Yes. They are people that
                    we would describe as proponents of a rule of law, a democratic system in which
                    the majority rules, but there is protection of the minorities, and equitable
                    justice, something close to Western democracy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was talking to somebody who was just therit was Keith

                        back in. I don't know what he means by this, but ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>MILLER: He means, probably, the economic cooption that many of the oligarchs are
                    engaged in combination with or under the direction of oligarchs in Moscow, in
                    Russia. The big banks in Moscow have been funding many of the acquisitions of
                    state assets of Ukraine. This is part of the near abroad policy of Russia to do
                    that. That's probably what Keith was referring to. Most of the economy is not
                    bad, most of the economy is the villages, farms, markets, bakeries, restaurants
                    and small shops of daily life, the work of daily life, which is becoming more
                    and more a matter of individual initiative. The great distinction between
                    oligarchy, which is basically monopolistic acquisition of money and assets as
                    opposed to individual effort, is an important one. That's the heart of the
                    struggle for the direction of economic policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've also been involved in Iranian affairs, too, haven't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Yes, Iranian affairs are taking more and more of my time. Iran was my
                    first Foreign Service post. It was an interest after that five-year period of
                    serving in Iran where I was deeply involved in Iran intellectually and
                    politicallan involvement that has not ceased, but has only deepened. Iran
                    continues to be an avocation and interest. I was going as ambassador to Iran in
                    1979, when the hostages were taken. I have told that story earlier. Right after
                    leaving Ukraine I was asked to go visit Iran by my Iranian diplomatic colleague
                    in Kyiv, Behzad Mazrui, the Iranian ambassador there, who was an Isfahani.
                    Despite official hostility, we became good friends. As it turned out he later
                    returned to Iran and became one of the ministers in the Khatami cabinet. He was
                    one of those who paved the road for a peaceful way of looking at the new Iran
                    after the revolution and war.</p>
                <p>I've been able to return to Iran for several long trips. I'm going in the middle
                    of April for two or three weeks and I may go again in May. I've been going on
                    the theory that Iran will, once again, be a close friend of the United States,
                    that it will get through this very difficult period of clerical rule. I am of
                    the opinion that Iran is well on the road to a form of democratic governance,
                    based on the will of the population that is well-educated and has already been
                    through over 100 years of political revolution, and that has experienced the end
                    of monarchy after 2,500 years of monarchy, and the end of totalitarian military
                    rule. Unfortunately, Iran now is under a form of clerical rule which is simply a
                    new form of rule by families, the 1,000 Families. When I went to Iran first it
                    was really a form of oligarchy. There were 1,000 Families that ran the country
                    under the Shah. They owned all the villages and factories and all of the
                    instruments of economy and had tremendous influence in the government as a
                    result.</p>
                <p>The shah was on top of all of this, he was the head of the families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 12, side one, with Bill Miller. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>MILLER: The shah was head of the family system of rule. The 1000 families were
                    really extensions of the court of the king, whether they were Qajar or the
                    earlier Safavids. The Pahlavis, have been replaced by clerical families, the
                    “turbans”, as they're somewhat disrespectfully called. But the system of
                    influence and governance is the same. The significant change and it is a new
                    change, and this is what I saw when I went back after the period of revolution
                    and war, was that most Iranians now felt that they were now the owners of the
                    country, because they had overthrown the monarchy and influence of the West, the
                    Western powers. They had fought a 10-year war with the Iraqis, and had
                    maintained their territorial integrity. It was, finally, their country.</p>
                <p>There is now almost 100 percent literacy for the young generations. The
                    revolutionaries and their children know what they want. They have seen the
                    outside world. Many of the revolutionary leaders were educated in the United
                    States and Western Europe. The revolutionaries believe in electoral politics,
                    that is, they want leaders who are chosen by democratic election. They clearly
                    have respect for rules, yet they chafe under the religious extreme rules. A rule
                    of law, a modern equilibrium of law, is still under formulative process that has
                    been underway for over a century.</p>
                <p>So Iran is still a very interesting place for me. I continue to have great
                    fascination with the art of the country from the earliest times, whether it's
                    prehistoric or in the Achaemenid period or Parthians or Sassanids or the present
                    period. I'm very interested in the archeology, having gone to all of the major
                    sites and dug in many of them. I have many friends there, I like the food and
                    music and the way of life. The climate is superb. Everything's up over a mile
                    high or more. It's a glorious climate, although the pollution of meagcities like
                    Tehran is tragic.</p>
                <p>So I have maintained an interest in Iran since I first served there as a junior
                    officer. I'm involved now in many of the key Iran issues in track two diplomacy,
                    since we don't have any normal diplomacy and are refusing the offers to have it
                    from the Iranians. Track II consists of discussion with Iranian officials and
                    prominent Iranian citizens about what rapprochement would mean and require. I've
                    been involved in Track II discussions as a member of meetings sponsored by the
                    United Nations Association in Sweden, New York and Vienna, to Search for Common
                    Ground, in Sweden, Austria and in Iran and here. The agendas are understood and
                    what the solutions might be; rapprochement could move very quickly.</p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>I had a prospect on the issue of Iran's intention of pursuing the construction of
                    a nuclear fuel cycle within the limits of the NPT. There is profound
                    disagreement between Iran and the United States and the EU on Iran's
                    interpretation of its rights under the NPT. The United States and Iran do not
                    have direct negotiations. As it happens, the key negotiators for the Iranians
                    are from the last generation of American-trained physicists and diplomats, that
                    is, they received graduate training here, and in some cases as undergraduates as
                    well. These diplomats are people that we can talk to and I do talk to them very
                    easily and directly. For example, the ambassador to the UN from Iran in New
                    York, Javad Zarif, has lived for over half his life in America. His high school,
                    college and graduate school education was in the United States. He is a good
                    friend. Amir Mahallati, who is the son of an ayatollah, is now succeeding his
                    father as a chief cleric in Shiraz. He was a key negotiator at the UN bringing
                    the Iran-Iraq War to an end. The ambassador in Paris, the ambassadors in Vienna
                    and Bern, several people now in Tehran that are working together on the issues
                    of concluding an agreement on nonproliferation. I have no right or authority to
                    negotiate, and I'm not negotiating. But we are discussing the issues, I know
                    what the details and framework of sound agreement would be, and I've conveyed
                    that to our government. What I've been doing in an informal way is informing
                    each side of each other's views and laying out as fully as possible, conceivable
                    outcomes.</p>
                <p>I'm able to do that because I know the players and I know the issues. I know the
                    arms control problems, because I've been working on those matters for 40 years,
                    and I've been fully educated in the science and technology by our best
                    scientists when I was working on the Hill in the 1960s and 1970s on the same
                    kinds of questions. I've been to SALT. I know the ABM issue backwards and
                    forwards. I was one of the key staff persons on the ABM Treaty and the SALT
                    Treaty.</p>
                <p>Perhaps it is an accident that what I have done in the past is pertinent and
                    useful now. But I think it is more than serendipity that I know Iran, having
                    kept at it because of personal interest over the years. I think Foreign Service
                    people tend to do that, once they get deeply involved, they never let go. It's
                    perhaps a natural result, but it also is an argument for examining carefully the
                    nature of our Foreign Service training. It seems to me that one should train
                    diplomats to have as deep and extensive an experience as possible. The nature of
                    our foreign affairs, of course, has changed in my lifetime. It certainly changed
                    in George Kennan's lifetime. I'm going to his 100th anniversary dinner tonight
                    at the Wilson Center.</p>
                <p>The issues have changed, the nature of the instruments used by our president and
                    our government, broadly construed, Congress's role has changed as well. Every
                    embassy now has 20 or 30 entities under its general direction bumbling away,
                    causing mischief or making a contribution, depending on the quality of
                    direction. The more experience an ambassador has of the fullness of our overseas
                    life, the more effective he's going to be. It is not enough to go to A-100, it
                    is not enough just to pass the exams.</p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>The examination threshold is very important. It's a democratizing instrument,
                    number one. Number two, it's an intellectual threshold which is very important,
                    and it might be a psychological screening of talent. Do you have enough personal
                    qualities to stand up to the stresses and difficulties? Entrance into the
                    Foreign Service at the bottom is very important, but it's only the beginning,
                    and serving at an embassy is only the beginning. I think it's desirable to have
                    assignments on the Hill, maybe also at other agencies, perhaps in the academic
                    world or in business to have some real sense of the fullness of American
                    life?</p>
                <p>Any notion that serving as an FSO from the bottom faithfully, dutifully, will
                    certainly result in becoming ambassador as a matter of course, is a false hope.
                    The career path is arbitrary and serendipitous, orderly rise in rank and reward
                    is simply not there. The largest embassies, the most comfortable ones, certainly
                    those with residences like big hotels, Paris, London and Madrid, are given as
                    political rewards for contributions to the winning presidential party. That's a
                    corruption of our system, but at its best, the president rewards people who are
                    experienced and competent and will do a good job, and not just because they're
                    close friends of the president.</p>
                <p>What's left to the career can be the dregs, assignments to the most difficult and
                    unrewarding and unimportant places. So a Foreign Service career, I think, has to
                    be more comprehensive, and the leadership of our Foreign Service establishment
                    should, and in many cases do take this into account. My close friend, Tom
                    Pickering, who is the best example of success within the career, still benefited
                    by the nature of the draw. In addition to his great talent, his arms control
                    assignments and UN connection is what propelled him. If he hadn't done that,
                    he'd be long since retired and doing something else.</p>
                <p>So I would say Foreign Service leadership, of which we have very little, should
                    take account of this kind of phenomena, and it's my hope that people like Tom,
                    and I think he already has to some extent, through his own example, make the
                    point about the desirability of this continuing professional education. I feel
                    very strongly about it, not only because I'm an example of it, a beneficiary. I
                    was able to do what I wanted, and believes I was able to do, to put it that way.
                    I followed my convictions and my intellectual belief, and I was able to do what
                    I thought was most important and useful. I was able to do that even as a junior
                    officer in Iran, where I came to the conclusion the shah was rotten and that he
                    was holding back what most of his countrymen wanted and that we were on the
                    wrong track at that stage in our support for the Shah and our refusal to push
                    for democratic reforms.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>My ambassador, Julius Holmes, protected me, even when the shah protested my
                    activities, by saying, “Easy on the young officer, he will learn and get over
                    it. You know him and like him.” The Shah accepted Holmes' advice. I was able to
                    leave the Foreign Service as a matter of conscience, on Vietnam, knowing that
                    the reason I was leaving, for policy differences on Vietnam, I could express
                    myself usefully by working on the Hill. It was a God-given opportunity, because
                    I learned not only how my government works, but in a much fuller sense, I was
                    working at the forefront of the major foreign policy issues. In those years,
                    that's where the heat of the policy battle was, on the Hill, the issues of who
                    has responsibility for war and peace, what our policy should be on weapons of
                    mass destruction, in particular arms control measures, on assistance, on the end
                    of the Cold War. I would say that the work I was doing on the Hill was an
                    absolutely invaluable interplay with traditional diplomacy. It also underlined
                    for me the reality, that so much of what we call foreign affairs is done that
                    way. Policy is not solely the province of the State Department. It's on the
                    Hill, it's in think tanks, it's in universities, in the NGOs, and to some extent
                    in business.</p>
                <p>After leaving the Hill, where I had worked on many major issues, certainly on the
                    issues of war and peace, intelligence, arms control, I went to Fletcher as a
                    teacher, as an administrator, as a dean. I was able to express the ideas I had
                    learned with incoming groups of Foreign Service officers, not just of our
                    country, but of other countries. Then, at the end of the of the Soviet Union,
                    working with Gorbachev's perestroika group, I was able to be in this remarkable
                    period of intellectual engagement, in the formation of a new world, so to speak,
                    as a head of a foundation in Moscow, in the heart of the Kremlin, with many of
                    our most distinguished leaders, and many of theirs. That education that came
                    from that experience perhaps was the most profound. People like Sakharov on the
                    one hand and our great nuclear physicists on the other, Panofsky, Drell, Garwin,
                    Bethe, Kistiakowsky, Doty, Ruina, McNamara, Jerry Wiesneit was an extraordinary
                    group.</p>
                <p>That was all part of my education, so when I went back to the Foreign Service as
                    an ambassador, I was ready, really prepared to work. I knew, certainly, how to
                    run organizations, because I had led several different kinds of organizations,
                    and had, of course, experienced embassy life earlier on and all through the
                    career. I had been involved in policymaking at the highest levelWhite House, on
                    the Hill, as well as in the departments and other governments, and worked on all
                    the major issues. But what enabled all that to happen was the Foreign Service
                    career itself, beginning with my A-100 group and the notion of the world of
                    foreign affairs that we shared and grew up with.</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>I look back on the nature of training for a foreign service career, and I would
                    say that insofar as the Foreign Service encourages growth, particularly
                    intellectual growth and experience, it is a wonderful career; insofar as it's
                    porous, that is, you can go in and out, I think it's healththe best of the
                    American system. It's the envy of the world in many ways, the whole idea of
                    being able to leave and come back into the foreign service, even though it
                    certainly is the opposite of a formal career system that's been established.
                    However, that, in my view is the real system. The career system as usually
                    described in entrance brochures is not the reality. It's only a partial
                    reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's interested how many Foreign Service officers
                        crop up in things like Jerry Bremer in Iraq, but just by their experiences
                        and intellectual ability do keep popping up in various places.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Oh, sure. But if you make an analysis of the career assignments,
                    obviously some assignments are much better than others. If you go to SS, the
                    Staff of the Secretary of State, as a junior officer, that is a platform for
                    advancement in the diplomatic-political world, if that's what you're interested
                    in. You have a better chance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The secretariat, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: You have a better chance than if you do not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely, also to be an aide, of a principal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Absolutely. So the official rhetoric about the career doesn't admit to
                    those things openly, although that's the reality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I hope what we've done here, it may take the
                        government decades, but the people, they can analyze careers from what we've
                        accumulated and people's experiences, and maybe translate this into passing
                        knowledge onto the next generation of American diplomats.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Well, I think so. I think what you're doing is very important, because it
                    encourages reflection on just the questions we spoke of in the last few minutes.
                    But I can see a great value coming out of the more focused views of people who
                    could presently improve the career system, like my friend Tom Pickering. I put a
                    lot of weight on him because he has done the most in the way of his formal
                    career, and he still has a role to play, I think, in suggesting ways things
                    could be done.</p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>I'll give you one example. When he was undersecretary, he sent out an ukase that
                    said, “When you've received a demarche from Washington, you can change it as you
                    think best to get the message across.” He knew exactly what he was doing,
                    because after a demarche would come out written by the desk officer and would be
                    cleared up the line, and would be cast in terms of the most offensive kind
                    of...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. There's a little bit of posturinnot a little
                        bit, a hell of a lot of posturing on the part of the system, the bureaucrats
                        in Washington want to show they're tough. It goes out to the field, it's not
                        going to fly, or it's going to be offensive. It's not going to work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: So Tom sent this message, this ukase, which said, basically, “I know what
                    it's like to be ambassador, so you reformulate it in a way that makes the
                    message deliverable, and if you don't think you should send it, tell us. We'll
                    try again.” That's very practical, that's very useful. It's the kind of
                    knowledge and professional craft that has to be used to make our system work
                    well. I would like to end by making a few more points about the value of a
                    career that extends over several decades. I am involved now on a very delicate,
                    extremely important project for an NGO, Search For Common Ground, which is in
                    essence, a dialogue between US physicists and their Iranian counterparts on the
                    subject of the peaceful issues of nuclear technology and the limits of the
                    NPT.</p>
                <p>This project is useful because there are, at present, no official relations
                    between the United States and Iran. This is the perfect fit of Track II NGOs
                    whose purpose is to keep dialogue going to present different approaches when
                    these are all deadlocks or stalemates and to act as informed go between when the
                    parties refuse or are unable to talk.</p>
                <p>In the present impasse between Iran and the United States a number of foreign
                    diplomats have been very helpful such as Timotheus (Tim) Guldimann, who was
                    Swiss ambassador to Tehran and Jan Eliason the Swedish President of the United
                    Nations Geneva Assembly, who was ambassador to the United States until this
                    summer. Jan had been involved with Iran when he was serving as a member of the
                    Swedish delegation to the United Nations during the period of the Iran-Iraq War
                    and had gone to Tehran to help negotiate an end to the conflict. He has
                    maintained an interest in Iran since that time. Jan and I have seen each other
                    since he served in Washington as a junior officer in the Swedish Embassy and I
                    was a staff aide on the Hill during the Vietnam issues of the 1960s. We are
                    working together on Iran now.</p>

                <p>Tim Guldimann is my European counterpart on the Search for Common Ground Iran
                    project. He has been working with the EU diplomats he has knows over the years
                    and at the IAEA to develop dialogue on the technical issues of IAEA enforcement
                    of NPT limits on the pursuit of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. Tim and
                    I share experiences in Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh and in Russia. We have become good
                    friends through our common interests. We are able to draw on our networks of
                    colleagues and friends developed over the years in advancing this very difficult
                    project on Iran's nuclear problems.</p>
                <p>Tom Pickering is a part of this effort as is Bill Luers and many others. A
                    lifetime in various battles with first rate professionals makes it possible to
                    take on even the most intractable issues like the present impasse with Iran over
                    its nuclear program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bill, I want to thank you very much. Thank you very
                        much. This has been fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MILLER: Thank you, I've enjoyed it, and it's not the least meeting you, getting
                    to know you through this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had a fascinating career.</hi>
