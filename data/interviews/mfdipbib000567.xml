                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add here that Dick and I are old friends, having
                        studied Serbian and then served in Yugoslavia together. I should say
                        Serbo-Croatian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Or even now Croato-Serbian, however you want to put it. Both ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, I wonder if you could start off by giving me a
                        little about your background. Where'd you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, I was born and raised in Winnetka, Illinois, outside Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to New Trier High School?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I didn't. We lived just outside the village limits of Winnetka, so I
                    was not within the New Trier High School area. I went to a private day-school in
                    Winnetka. And went to Harvard, then went into the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Forty-two. Graduated with a B.A. Then was in the Navy. Spent some time
                    on a destroyer in the Pacific. Thereafter, I worked for a little bit of time in
                    a company in Chicago that made cast iron pipe. And then joined the Department of
                    State as a civil servant. Worked as a civil servant for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you towards the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think my Navy experience gave me a taste for working for an
                    organization that I felt had some fairly high objectives, a U.S. government
                    organization that I wanted to be a part of. I was proud of my service in the
                    Navy, and to go from that into the world of trade was, for me, a rather boring
                    prospect. I don't think it would be now; I have probably different outlooks on
                    these things. But, then, I wanted to be a part of the process of post-war
                    recovery. And so I joined the State Department and eventually was one of the
                    officers in the Office of Chinese Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the department in 1947, and you worked
                        there, I guess as a civil servant, until 1951. Could you describe a little
                        of the environment? It was a time when the State Department was sort of
                        trying to read its way into the role of being a world power, wasn't it? And
                        also being a major organization within a world power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I think things were a good deal simpler then, needless to say.
                    There was a small number of major issues around the world, rather than a whole
                    basketful of them, that we felt we needed to be involved in. The one that I was
                    most directly involved in was the process of Nationalist China going down the
                    drain. I was in the Office of Chinese Affairs, and of course these were McCarthy
                    days, so that, in a way, conditioned the mood in the State Department, which was
                    a very cautious one and one of considerable concern, even seeping down to the
                    lower levels in the Civil Service. You never knew when you were going to show up
                    on some list for some crime you really didn't commit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really, this McCarthy period was of concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It certainly was in the sector that I was working in, the Office of Far
                    Eastern Affairs on the China desk. I worked for a time for several old China
                    hands who were hit by McCarthy and their careers were seriously damaged. They
                    later recovered and they're now highly respected as Sinologists, but, at that
                    time, McCarthy had succeeded in creating a good deal of fear in the ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Chinese Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was a junior professional assistant, I think they called them in those
                    days. I worked mainly with the economist for Chinese Affairs, who was concerned
                    with the question of aid to China. At that time, Chiang had retreated to
                    Formosa, and he was raising the Nationalist China flag from Formosa. And he had
                    a lot of support in those days in Congress, as you remember. And there was a
                    major debate going on as to whether the U.S. should continue to support Chiang
                    Kai-shek with large-scale aid. As you may remember, there was a White Paper put
                    out, sort of illustrating how our assistance to Chiang had been wasted. There
                    was reluctance in the United States government at that time to endorse
                    large-scale aid programs for Chiang. And this put the Executive Branch in sort
                    of a running duel with the Congress on many counts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we're talking about junior level, but, still, how
                        did you find the reporting on the economic situation? I suppose, at that
                        point, you were concerned about the economic situation on Taiwan, but you're
                        getting from both. I mean, how'd you find...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't remember there being much, Stu. Of course, we had no posts in
                    mainland China then. What reporting was done was mainly a sort of
                    intelligence-type reporting, through posts like Hong Kong, and we weren't too
                    much interested in the economy of Taiwan. It was mainly a political matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Korean War, which started in June of 1950, which
                        was right in the middle of the time you were there, change much of what you
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I think it intensified the battle between those who were in support
                    of Chiang Kai-shek and felt we should demonstrate that support by large aid
                    programs, and the more conservative forces that didn't see much benefit for the
                    U.S. in further supporting the Gimo. I say that because, when General MacArthur
                    came back from Korea, a great deal of this sentiment coalesced around him. He
                    was a very strong exponent for helping Chiang Kai-shek, because he felt that was
                    a good hope for getting at the Chinese Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you moved to Hong Kong in 1951 and you were
                        there until '54. Was this still with the Civil Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I joined the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: That's a good question, and I've often wondered. I was having a
                    fascinating time in Chinese Affairs and enjoyed it. And I had the feeling, which
                    persisted throughout much of my Foreign Service career, that it's in Washington
                    where the decisions were made, and that was a fun place to be, it's where the
                    action was. I took the Foreign Service exams while I was in the Office of
                    Chinese Affairs, partly just to see how I'd do, without much intention then of
                    going into the service. And I was deferred on the orals because my knowledge of
                    U.S. history wasn't very good. Even before that, I was deferred because my
                    German was not up to date. So I repaired my German, took the language exam
                    again, then I spent a year studying U.S. history, because it was just a
                    challenge to me to get through this thing. And I passed the oral exam easily the
                    second time. Thereafter, I think I just felt I'd put so much effort into this
                    thing that I ought to give the Service a try. And my people in Chinese Affairs
                    wanted me to go to Hong Kong to help in the commercial section with the trade
                    controls that we had then, if you remember, very intensive controls to prevent
                    goods from Communist China getting into the United States, and, conversely, to
                    prevent U.S. exports from getting into Communist China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting from a historical point of view to think
                        how much effort has been put into the United States commercial controls, not
                        spreading trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During World War II, an awful lot of our officers were
                        doing nothing but trying to stick it to the, particularly the Germans, to
                        keep them from getting stuff out of Latin America. And we sort of went right
                        back into that mode again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: You're so right, we did. And we expended a tremendous amount of money
                    and effort. And I was in the middle of that when I was in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>It even got kind of amusing, the depth of our concerns. For example, in trying to
                    prevent Chinese Communist products from arriving in the United States, we got
                    into some very detailed definitions of what is a Chinese product. There are a
                    lot of Chinese products based on egg and chicken, food products that were
                    exported to the U.S. traditionally. And, of course, exports from Hong Kong we
                    were happy to let in, because this was a friendly British colony, but nothing
                    from Communist China. Well, the border between Hong Kong and Communist China
                    runs through a swamp, and there were a lot of Chinese vegetable goods produced
                    in that swamp, on both sides of the border, and there was no way of detecting,
                    for example, a litchi nut produced in Hong Kong from one produced in China. And
                    it got even more technical when you got into egg products. It was clear that if
                    the egg had been hatched in Communist China, even though the egg was brought
                    into Hong Kong for processing, it was a Communist product. But how about if the
                    chicken comes from Communist China and is brought across the border into Hong
                    Kong live and lays the egg on the Hong Kong side, is that then a Communist
                    product?</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were matters of debate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: These were matters that had to be answered, defined, because we were
                    policing this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>And, looking the other way, there was a tremendous effort to keep U.S. goods from
                    getting into Communist China. And in the commercial section I did a lot of
                    export checking. You know the old export checks, where you try to decide what
                    will happen to this particular product—if it's brought in, will it be
                    re-exported?</p>
                <p>That is really a battle of wits in Hong Kong, because a Chinese company that is
                    importing and perhaps does intend to send it to Communist China, would find all
                    sorts of ways of evading these eager-beaver American vice consuls. As you came
                    up the steps, with the sign of the U Fong Company on somebody's desk, and they
                    saw you coming, the sign would be quickly removed and another sign would be put
                    up there. You'd ask, “Is Mr. Chin around?” And they'd say, “He is not here right
                    now, maybe he'll be back later.”</p>
                <p>But I remember particularly one export check that I was asked to make on, of all
                    things, prophylactic rubbers. And the question was: What are Hong Kong's
                    requirements for prophylactic rubbers? And I had to go all around Hong Kong,
                    talking to importers of prophylactic rubbers and asking: How many do you think
                    Hong Kong uses? And how many are re-exported to China? And I wrote about a
                    ten-or twelve-page airgram, which received commendations from Washington. Then I
                    got a further communication saying, “Please update this carefully. We have heard
                    that the Chinese Communists are using prophylactic rubbers to protect the
                    muzzles of their guns from moisture.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did in Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That's what Washington said. They said this is being done in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember it distinctly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: And so I was double checking, and then I got another telegram from the
                    Pentagon that said, “Forget all about it. Our experts have said that if you do
                    try to protect your gun muzzles that way, it will simply rust and pit-out the
                    muzzles themselves because moisture will collect, there is no air in the muzzle.
                    So any prophylactic rubbers that want to go to Communist China, okay.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't look at the strategic value of trying to
                        keep the Chinese population down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, that wasn't part of that check. So that was challenging, but a
                    tremendous expense of time and effort, as you said. We had a commercial section
                    of, I would guess, four or five officers. And they didn't do any trade
                    development work, it was all this kind of control.</p>
                <p>I think at that time we had some concern that maybe the British patrols, patrols
                    that were designed to prevent smuggling from Hong Kong to China, were not
                    sufficiently efficient. To reassure us, they said I could ride on British
                    patrols at night and watch them intercepting junks smuggling—steel plate was a
                    big item and tires—to Canton. And I spent several very exciting nights
                    patrolling Hong Kong waters. They'd pull junks over and go aboard and search for
                    contraband. And a few of these junks tried to evade the patrols. It was exciting
                    and interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering really how the Consulate General observed
                        things in China. Did you have the feeling they were getting much information
                        from talking to others there, or was it a group of Cold Warriors really
                        hunkered down at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, Stu, they had some really good China hands. These were people who
                    had served in China before and knew the country, State Department Foreign
                    Service people. Of course, there were CIA people there, too, who were very good.
                    And there was a great deal of interviewing of people coming across the
                    line—university professors from China and business people. And there was a great
                    deal of reading of anything that was published that came out of China. It was
                    the principal listening post for China. It was one of the very largest American
                    posts in the world at that time, larger than most embassies. We had forty-two
                    vice consuls, just vice consuls alone. It was known as a marrying post—I met my
                    wife there— and we counted a total of six weddings that developed from contacts
                    in the Consulate there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God. Was Pat, your wife, was she...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: She was there as a consular assistant, having joined the Foreign Service
                    before I did.</p>
                <p>I spent about two years in the commercial section, and then a couple of years in
                    the consular section, which was also very colorful and also involved a great
                    deal of detailed effort that produced little in terms of the interests of the
                    U.S. citizenry.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Here the effort was to keep Chinese from entering the U.S. illegally. And the
                    base of the problem is that, in China, at least then, they didn't have civil
                    documents. There was no such thing as an official birth certificate or an
                    official marriage certificate. So you had to rely on informal evidence if you
                    were a Chinese and you wanted, for example, to prove that you were the son of a
                    Chinese and therefore entitled to non-quota entry. And very often the Chinese
                    father would be in the States and he would be asking that this young man come in
                    as his son. Well, there was a great deal of illegal importation of Chinese young
                    men into the U.S. for various labor purposes, so in the visa section we had to
                    be extremely careful. And the “son” would come in with what was called informal
                    evidence. This would be, oh, say, badly worn letters from “Dad,” sent to this
                    kid supposedly when he was such and such an age—but sometimes the ink wouldn't
                    be too dry on them. Or they would unroll a beautiful certificate, and you'd say,
                    “What is that thing?”</p>
                <p>And he'd say, “That is the announcement of the marriage of Mom and Dad, and it's
                    signed down here by the Chinese gentleman who presided at the wedding.”</p>
                <p>And you'd feel it and say, “This paper feels pretty new. This doesn't look like
                    the certificate that was used when your father was married.”</p>
                <p>And then he'd pull out a photograph of him with old “Dad” alongside, to prove the
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>And you'd say, “Why is it that the left-hand side of this photograph is light,
                    whereas the right-hand side is so dark? Looks almost as though something had
                    been pasted together here. Why don't you try again and come back in a few
                    weeks.”</p>
                <p>I felt for the poor Chinese.</p>
                <p>Then they developed blood testing as a means of tripping things up. Because, of
                    course, a blood test can prove that by anything known to medical science you
                    cannot be the result of the union of these two people. “Mother,” of course, was
                    often a part of this. She would come in with this alleged son, to testify that
                    yes, I remember well when Jimmy here was born, and his father is, sure enough,
                    this guy in San Francisco. And you'd take a blood test on all three, and it
                    would come out that Jimmy just couldn't be the son of this union. And you'd not
                    only have to turn him down, but you'd...this was the hardest, really the hardest
                    thing I had to do in all my consular work, you'd have to turn down this poor,
                    aging woman because she had lied under oath. And you'd have to tell her that
                    under no circumstances could she rejoin her husband. And that is just a real,
                    real hard thing. A lot of human interest stories in that work.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I remember...I'll get off this subject soon, but it is colorful. The citizenship
                    section worked on somewhat the same problems, although here the young man was
                    trying to prove that he was entitled to U.S. citizenship. There the effort was
                    based principally on his trying to prove that he was born in a certain village
                    at a certain time. He would come into the Consulate with a “witness,” a friend
                    from the same village. And both of them had been very carefully coached at a
                    school set up in Hong Kong to brief guys who were appearing before the U.S.
                    Consul so they would know what to say. The examination consisted of getting a
                    piece of paper and drawing a sort of an informal map of the village. And the
                    examiner would say, “Now in your village where was the, let's say, the place
                    where the gentlemen bathed themselves?” And you'd ask them separately. The
                    witness would come in and say it was over here; and the applicant would put it
                    over here. And you'd say, “Well, you two don't seem to be from the same town
                    really.” And then you'd check out with them the place where the small market was
                    in the village—tremendous detail. If you passed this oral quizzing, there was a
                    place in Hong Kong where you could buy healthy, warm stools before you came in
                    for your physical exam. Colorful assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You then left there for a much more mundane world,
                        didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I went to Toronto after that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you were there for about a year or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That was, I would say, a rather dull assignment, being in the Consulate
                    in Toronto. I did only consular work, and it was very open and shut. We didn't
                    find Toronto very exciting, although we had Maple Leaf (hockey) season
                    tickets.</p>
                <p>Some of our vice consuls at that time found Canada a surprisingly hostile milieu.
                    They were people, I guess who, like me, had been brought up to think that this
                    was a brother country. Their parents had talked to them about the thousands of
                    miles of undefended frontier. So they expected to be welcomed as brothers. And
                    they were surprised to find the Canadians a little bit prickly about being
                    called brothers, because they thought there was something condescending about
                    that.</p>
                <p>One of our vice consuls resigned while he was there. He had, before he resigned,
                    written an article for Maclean magazine, which was titled “I'm Leaving Canada
                    and I'm Glad of It.” Fortunately, he had left about two days before Macleans hit
                    the newsstand, because our Consul general really blew his stack—here was a U.S.
                    vice consul stirring that pot.</p>
                <p>I don't think I was there for more than maybe a year in Toronto. And I applied
                    for Polish language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Polish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, it was one of the very first hard languages available, and it
                    seemed to me a good way to get in on the ground floor of a fairly small corps of
                    officers that would have some real expertise in a certain area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe not to overhit this, but one had the feeling—I
                        certainly did—that for at least a decade or so the East European hands were
                        a real corps. In a way, that was, during the '50s and maybe early '60s, the
                        way to replicate the old days of the Russian hands, the Soviet hands, who
                        came in, in the '30s and a little bit of the '40s—the Kennans and the
                        Bohlens and all. And East Europe was attracting somewhat the same type of
                        interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think so. I agree with you entirely, Stu. And there was a certain
                    esprit de corps among us, to the extent that one of us, Walt Jenkins, whom you
                    probably know, became very articulate in complaining when Soviet language and
                    area officers were assigned to EE posts, thereby preventing members of this EE
                    group from ascending to levels of counselor of embassy and DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You took Polish, what, for a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think that lasted about six or seven months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation at the embassy when you got to
                        Warsaw? Who was the ambassador, how did he or she operate, and what went
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The ambassador was a man named Joseph E. Jacobs, who had more time in
                    the Foreign Service than anyone else at that time. He had something like forty
                    years of service. He was aging, and beloved by his entire staff. He was a well-
                    organized man, a kindly person, of course tremendously experienced in
                    diplomacy.</p>
                <p>It was a frozen situation. There was very little we could do when I first
                    arrived. It was a typical Soviet-bloc set up: few contacts.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Then, midway in my tour, of course, the Poznan riots occurred. And then there was
                    the exciting time when mobs surged down the avenue in front of our embassy, to
                    besiege the Russian embassy and shake fists at them. Later on, tank tracks had
                    been found around the camps where the Russians had based their armored forces.
                    So apparently the Russians at one point had decided to move on Warsaw with their
                    tanks because of this surge of anti-Soviet feeling in Warsaw.</p>
                <p>This all resulted, of course, in an agreement whereby the Russians pulled most of
                    their troops out. Gomulka came in. For a time, there was a great deal of
                    relaxation in Poland, and the atmosphere was hugely improved. There was a great
                    deal of interest in contacting Americans, but even more, Western Europeans,
                    because Poland, of course, has this tremendous orientation toward France and
                    Britain, as well as the U.S.</p>
                <p>But, as history shows, eventually things froze back over again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at the embassy when you went
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was the economic officer, Stu. I did some economic reporting. Just
                    about any shreds that you could get were of interest. The only reporting you
                    could get on the industrial progress was out of the newspapers, and of course it
                    was heavily censored and very optimistic. You could travel around and observe a
                    bit, but not much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you go to industries and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Oh, no. No, no. No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing the way that we used to be able to do it in
                        Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. Oh, once in a while, if a big delegation was in town that somehow
                    the Poles wanted to smooth over the right way, they'd invite them to visit a
                    showplace, like Nova Huta, the big ironworks. But we Embassy people couldn't get
                    access to even a food processing plant by asking the protocol of the Foreign
                    Ministry to get in.</p>
                <p>I was the economic officer; in small posts they didn't call them counselors then.
                    The political officer also was in the same office that I was, and we shared an
                    office. His name was also Johnson, Valdemar Johnson, still a very good friend of
                    mine. And people longed for the day when Valdemar would be transferred, to end
                    the confusion of having two Johnsons. But Valdemar was replaced by Richard G.
                    Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God. How about contact, both on the official and on
                        the sort of personal level, with the Poles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: For a time, at the end of our tour of duty, it became easy and very
                    pleasant. We made some good friends—business people and doctors. As I say,
                    that's after Poland's revolution that brought back Gomulka and led to a great
                    relaxation in the tension. This and the Poznan riots were, I guess, the first
                    open defiance of Soviet authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there were the little Berlin riots in '53. And then
                        there was the Poznan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That's right, there were. You're quite right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Poznan riots were when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Poznan riots were in '56. I was in Poznan at the time, I'd gone down
                    for the Poznan Fair. The riots took place then because there were a lot of
                    foreigners in town for the Poznan Fair whom the rioters wanted to impress.</p>
                <p>We encountered an interesting Polish businessman at a nightclub. Eating space was
                    very scarce in the restaurants in Poznan during the fair, so we joined him at
                    his table, with his dolly, a very attractive young lady. We got to talking about
                    his livelihood; we were sort of curious as to how he could afford to keep buying
                    champagne, which he insisted that we drink as well as his dollbaby. He kept
                    asking us to dance with this beautiful young lady.</p>
                <p>One thing led to another, and finally he said, “All right, I'll tell you how I
                    can afford this. I have a good way of making money. Like many others, I make
                    money on the margins. It's not really illegal, but the authorities would like to
                    know about it. And I know you guys won't squeal on me.”</p>
                <p>He had very good contacts in places like the downtown department store in Warsaw
                    and other places that handled textiles and suits, ready-made clothing. There's a
                    lot of very shoddy stuff available. The good stuff came from just a very few
                    plants and factories in Poland, and it was delivered infrequently. But he had
                    enough good contacts so that he would get a phone call when a delivery was going
                    to be made from the factory. And as the truck was backed up to the unloading
                    platform of the department store, he would be there with his truck. And he would
                    simply buy it all—at the retail price; it was all legal and covered by papers,
                    but it was transferred directly into his truck. And he took it to his place. He
                    had a huge basement there, filled with good stuff. This was the prime quality
                    stuff, and Warsaw citizens knew if they really wanted to get a good, good suit,
                    of good material, they could always get it from him, at a damn high price.</p>

                <p>Further on in the evening, as things warmed up and we had a bit more champagne,
                    he whispered to us, “You know, this place is going to blow sky high
                    tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>We said, “What do you mean?”</p>
                <p>“Yep, they're going out on the streets and they're gonna raise hell.”</p>
                <p>We thought about it, and the subject changed. Fortunately we had the sense, when
                    we got back to our hotel a bit later, maybe a half an hour later, to call
                    someone in the embassy and say that there is this rumor in Poznan. Because it
                    was the next day that things busted open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sort of watch it from the sidelines there? How
                        does one act when there is a major riot in a city where one happens to
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We were very much on the sidelines. We stayed on the fringes of the mob,
                    and I don't think we had particularly good insights as to what was going on. I
                    don't remember our providing any specially valuable reporting on the thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that you were under tight
                        security surveillance at the time you were there? Were there problems with
                        sort of attempts at sexual attraction, or drinking, or, you know, I mean,
                        what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. Again, this was during the first half of my tour. There was a
                    dramatic change with the events of 1956 and Gomulka's arrival on the scene. But
                    during the first half, yes, there was very heavy surveillance. If we left
                    Warsaw, we were always followed by black Citroens, which were souped-up so that
                    they could keep up with the cars we had, which were pretty powerful Mercuries
                    and things like that. The pursuit got intense. And in some ways I think we
                    behaved in a rather childish fashion in trying to dodge these followers. There
                    was no reason to; there was nothing really that we wanted to do that they could
                    have detained us for. But we would try to out speed them. And if that failed,
                    there was one trick that we'd do. After having been on the road for two or three
                    hours in the morning, we would finally pull up in a nice rural scene and get out
                    some Thermos bottles as though we were going to picnic and take it easy for a
                    while. And the secret police people, who'd been parked in front of our
                    apartments for several hours even before we left, had to go to the bathroom like
                    tremendous, and they'd come flying out of their Citroens and disappear into the
                    woods, whereupon we'd quickly pile the Thermos bottles back into the car and
                    dash off. You'd see these poor guys coming out of the woods, buttoning their
                    pants up. As I say, it was terribly childish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such are sort of things of the Cold War.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was childish, but it provided a bit of excitement in what was
                    otherwise a rather dull existence, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to the department, where you served
                        from '57 to '61. What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was Polish desk officer. I was also the Baltic States desk officer.
                    And, in that latter role, I had the job of writing every year the White House
                    statement about the independence of the Baltic States. And I can still remember
                    some of those phrases about how we stood totally behind the Baltic States in
                    their desire eventually to throw off the Soviet yoke. And how we refuse to
                    recognize the incorporation of these states into the Soviet Union. And how we'd
                    never abandon the flame of freedom in the Baltic States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this, I assume, was really very pro forma, wasn't
                        it? I mean, the Baltic States—Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia— always had
                        their legations that were here, but did you really do much with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, the main things I remember were, we went of course to all of their
                    functions, and I became good friends with the ambassadors. Lithuania and Latvia
                    had embassies (or legations) in Washington. Estonia had a Consulate in New York.
                    Of course, they still do. No, there wasn't a great deal of activity. Preparing
                    this independence statement, this was something of course that the
                    Baltic-Americans really looked forward to and they made a lot of it. Another
                    thing, though, that the Baltic States desk officer did was to approve the
                    budgets of these three posts. And that was because the posts existed, and for
                    all I know still do today, on funds that the U.S. Treasury had seized at the
                    outbreak of World War II, or at least when the Nazis invaded the Baltic States,
                    because we didn't want the Germans to get their hands on them. So we were still
                    husbanding those resources, and in order for the Baltic diplomats in Washington
                    and New York to get their hands on this money, they had to come to me, kind of
                    hat in hand, with the budget. And I would go over it with them, because I knew
                    the Treasury Department would go over it very carefully afterwards. And I'd say
                    things to this...it seems ridiculous in retrospect...to this dignified old
                    Latvian ambassador, “Arnolds, why are you asking for six brooms? What do you do
                    with all these brooms? Didn't you get brooms last year?”</p>
                <p>And he'd say, “Forget about it, I'll buy the brooms myself.”</p>
                <p>So I'd strike brooms off. And finally this budget, as vetted by us, would go to
                    the Treasury Department and after even closer examination of it they would
                    release the funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about this period of '57 to '61—relations with
                        Poland had sort of opened up; this was really the end of the Eisenhower
                        administration—were there any particular developments at that time that as
                        Polish desk officer you were dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Nothing particularly exciting, Stu. This was a time of a gradual
                    refreezing of the relationship. You remember Gomulka came in with great promise,
                    and it looked as though there was going to be continuing liberalization, but
                    Gomulka himself proved a bit of a disappointment, and then he left and the
                    future Polish leadership and the PZPR became quite conventional in the Soviet
                    state mold. I remember we did fight certain battles for the Poles. I think in
                    Washington we tried to treat the Poles a notch or two better than the other
                    Soviet bloc countries.</p>
                <p>I remember a lesson I learned in how bureaucracy works. The Poles were picking up
                    cotton in the United States, and the handiest port for them was Wilmington,
                    North Carolina. Wilmington was not on the list of ports approved for bloc
                    vessels, and we tried hard (because there is nothing particularly strategic in
                    Wilmington), just as an accommodation for the Poles, to get Wilmington added to
                    the list.</p>
                <p>Well, far more conservative elements in the U.S. government opposed this roundly,
                    and took it right up to the NSC. In those days, these problems were hashed out
                    in the NSC by a vote.</p>
                <p>The assistant secretary for European Affairs told me go on up to the NSC and
                    argue this case. Why not let the Poles come into Wilmington, for Pete's sake? So
                    I prepared for it, and I could see a real collision coming.</p>
                <p>I was told by the representative of Treasury that Treasury feels very strongly
                    about this. “Our deputy secretary is going to appear on behalf of Treasury. Are
                    you sure you want to be carrying the flag for the Department of State,
                    Dick?”</p>
                <p>I told the assistant secretary, and he said, “Oh, my God, I should ask our deputy
                    secretary to go up and argue this question?”</p>
                <p>I think eventually he went, or maybe an under secretary, but it just showed to me
                    how very minor problems can be elevated to an importance that they really do not
                    deserve, if a certain U.S. agency happens to feel strongly about it, and if
                    there happens to be, let's say, a deputy secretary who isn't terribly busy and
                    he's looking for issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was one in which to take the State Department on,
                        head on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, what about the Polish lobby? This must have been a
                        very powerful group. How did they affect you in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, generally, Stu, they supported our policies. And of course it's a
                    very powerful group, the Polish-American Congress. They were very conservative.
                    Again, I'm referring to the period after the refreeze began and not to the balmy
                    days of Gomulka in '56. They approved of our treatment of Poland as a
                    Soviet-bloc country. And I think they were happy enough to see us doing what
                    little we could to accommodate them in certain sectors, and in actually
                    distinguishing between Poland and the other bloc countries. They approved of
                    that, the idea of not lumping all the bloc countries together, but giving Poland
                    individual treatment. But most of them refused to have any contact with Poland.
                    There were a very few that traveled to Poland in those days, but not many, and
                    the Polish- American Congress did not encourage group travel to Poland. We had
                    no problems with pressure groups, because by and large they supported the U.S.
                    government's stand on Poland then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left that, and this is where our paths crossed.
                        You took Serbo-Croatian. Was this sort of a normal course for somebody who
                        wants to be an Eastern European hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. By then I think I'd decided that Eastern Europe was my bag and that
                    I couldn't stay in Poland indefinitely, so I volunteered for Serbo-Croatian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You spent a year there studying, or about a year, in the

                <p>JOHNSON: It wasn't quite a year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where the courses were located. Well, what did you
                        do then? I mean, you came to Belgrade, and what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Just a little reminiscence about our language training. You remember
                    Jankovic and Popovic, the teachers, both from the little town of Sabac, about
                    sixty miles outside of Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Sava River.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Popovic owned the hotel in the center of town, which is to this day the
                    principal coffee shop. And I remember asking these two gentlemen how does it
                    happen, when there are only two instructors in Serbian in the whole U.S.
                    government, they're both from the same little tank town? And their answer was
                    that it's in Sabac that the purest Serbo-Croatian is spoken. Well, I thought
                    that was kind of cute and kind of funny, and I told this story many times. I
                    told it last June in Belgrade, and the guy didn't think it was funny at all. He
                    said, “You know, that's where Karadzic is from. And he's the guy that...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who changed the whole language.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was my god, as far as I'm concerned, because he did
                        something about the spelling of Serbian, which made it impossible to
                        misspell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And simplified the language. Anybody who'll do that is a
                        god as far as I'm concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's spelled the way it's spoken. So that's why Sabac was on the
                    map.</p>
                <p>In Belgrade, on that tour, I was a second secretary in the political section, no
                    great shakes. I did things like analyzing the new constitution—about forty-five
                    endless pages in the dullest airgram that ever was sent. But the thing that made
                    that tour interesting and exciting was that George Kennan was our
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain, in the first place, his reputation
                        before you went there, what you felt about him, and then how you found him
                        as a boss.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, of course I was tremendously impressed with him before I went,
                    with what reading I'd done. And as a boss I just can't imagine a more exciting
                    person to work with. The other boss that I would say that I particularly enjoyed
                    working with in my career was John Crimmins, in Brasilia. But Kennan was the
                    sort of a person who liked to rap with his junior officers, as did Crimmins, it
                    happened. And he, as you remember, developed this project of publishing a
                    history of Yugoslavia, and each of us was assigned a chapter, then he would ask
                    us to come up on Sundays and sit around the fire and discuss various aspect of
                    developments that were going on. He is such a tremendously articulate and deeply
                    intelligent person that these were really fascinating Sunday afternoons. Also,
                    he would invite us in when he came back from a meeting with Tito, and he would
                    tell us how the meeting went and analyze it in very perceptive terms.</p>
                <p>I remember one story about his dealings with Tito. I'm not too sure that it's
                    true, but it could be. That after one meeting, he was getting up to go. He and
                    Tito were by then quite good friends. And Tito started to say something as
                    Kennan left, he said, “Mr. Ambassador, if you don't mind, I'd...” And then he
                    stopped.</p>
                <p>And Kennan said, “Yes, what is it?”</p>
                <p>And Tito said, “No, never mind, never mind. I don't want to say it. I don't want
                    to appear ungenerous.”</p>
                <p>And Kennan said, “Well, now, come on, please, we know each other well enough so
                    that I know how to take it if you want to give me something straight.”</p>
                <p>And so Tito said, “All right, sit down.” And Tito told him that he'd just as soon
                    not have any more U.S. aid. That it was embarrassing to Yugoslavia to be a bone
                    of contention in the U.S. Congress each year, and to have the question raised as
                    to whether Yugoslavia was Communist or not. And that he thought Yugoslavia had
                    progressed enough so that if we could shift to trade not aid he would appreciate
                    it.</p>
                <p>So Kennan went back and sent that telegram in. And fortunately the Department of
                    State and Congress took it on good terms, and the aid was gradually terminated.
                    And really from then on our relations were smooth and cordial, at least up to
                    the present day. It's hard to say what's going to happen in Yugoslavia now and
                    where the U.S. stands. We have to see what results before we can decide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're speaking right now, in January 1991, where there is
                        terrific tension between Serbia and particularly Croatia and Slovenia. A
                        very, very critical time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. Absolutely. Serbia and Croatia and Slovenia, yes. But what I was
                    going to say is that, all along, since the date that aid program terminated, our
                    relations have been just extremely smooth and very cordial, hardly a ripple on
                    the stream.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe a bit about how you, and maybe the
                        political section, saw the political situation in Yugoslavia in this period
                        of '62, '63ish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, I'm trying to separate what happened on my second tour in
                    Yugoslavia from what developed at this time, in these earlier days. There wasn't
                    a great deal of liberalization in Yugoslavia then. They had made their break
                    with Stalin and deserved full credit, high marks for that. And they had
                    developed their own economic system and I felt deserved high marks for that. As
                    far as contacts were concerned, it wasn't easy. There was still a certain amount
                    of distrust of foreigners, I'd say, and of course the Yugoslav press was not
                    very liberal or not very free then.</p>
                <p>I look back on that tour as having been exciting, in the sense that Yugoslavia
                    was a country going its own way. And the one nice thing about it, one could
                    travel. And if you went through protocol in advance, you could meet officials in
                    towns and talk to them about the situation where they were.</p>
                <p>I say “if you talked to protocol in advance” — on one occasion we were visiting
                    Pristina and the word had not gone in ahead. We checked in at the office of
                    the...I guess it was the head of the autonomous government, or the vice
                    president of it, and announced ourselves. And we were told to sit down. And we
                    sat down and waited for about forty-five minutes or an hour. And then someone
                    came down and said, “What do you want here?”</p>
                <p>And we told them it was just a friendly visit, to talk about conditions.</p>
                <p>“Well, you can read about it in the newspaper. We are not interested in talking
                    with you. You're obviously trying to get some information that is not going to
                    be made generally available. And we would appreciate it if you would leave town
                    immediately” (before sundown, as in our Westerns)</p>
                <p>And we were escorted by the UB to the edge of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UB being the Udba, the secret police.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Those were the bad days. Things gradually got a good deal better, and I
                    have a wonderful time now when I go to Yugoslavia. I visit wherever I want to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an aside, protocol one time arranged for a visit.
                        We asked to go to some industry, and I found myself, with another Foreign
                        Service officer, Harry Dunlap, in the middle of a factory, and we noticed
                        that everything they said was very guarded. It didn't dawn on us until we
                        were halfway through our meeting that it was a cellulose factory, which made
                        gun powder. Protocol probably hadn't realized it, and we hadn't realized it,
                        and here we were talking about what do you do, you know. And they were very,
                        very unhappy about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No wonder. Well, there were possibilities to get factory visits and
                    visits to towns, and certainly life was a lot different in Yugoslavia even then
                    than it was at that time in Soviet-bloc countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you figure what was going on in the
                        political world there? You had two newspapers, Politika and Borba. I was
                        sitting in the consular section, and I would read them, both in Serbian and
                        then in English translation, and no matter which you read them in, to me
                        they were almost incomprehensible. How did you cut your way through the
                        verbiage to find out what were the political dynamics of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, although contacts were not easy, informal contacts with just plain
                    friends, contacts with government people, some of them very shrewd observers,
                    and with journalists, you remember this, were entirely possible. So I shouldn't
                    have indicated there was a freeze on contacts.</p>
                <p>I remember in particular one very fine senior constitutional lawyer who was
                    connected with the government in a sort of consulting capacity, and very often,
                    when I'd read of some political development or when I wanted some interpretation
                    of a provision of the constitution, I'd call this fine old gentleman up and he'd
                    say, yeah, come by. He wasn't giving away any secrets, he was just sort of
                    telling me how things worked and how they were going to work. And there were
                    other contacts of that sort that the political section had, open contacts,
                    obviously cleared by any authorities that needed to clear them. And we could
                    talk to journalists, who were fairly well informed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did we view the Tito government? Did we see this
                        as having continuity after he departed the scene? Were we talking about
                        trouble on the horizon, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't think we were. I don't know how you feel about this, but I don't
                    think we realized then how unstable things would become when Tito passed
                    away.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>And, of course, Tito's approach to that was a rather frightening one. Instead of
                    taking someone whom he trusted and training him to be successor, preparing him
                    for that, Tito took the opinion there can be no new Tito; the only thing that's
                    going to hold this country together (and there's certainly some rationale for
                    this viewpoint) is to give each republic an equal opportunity to speak its piece
                    in decisions—government by consent (which has turned out to be terribly
                    clumsy).</p>
                <p>But I don't think we viewed that with alarm when he died, I think we felt this
                    was a good way to allow the republics to let off steam. And we felt that, sure,
                    you can't have that kind of a government indefinitely; we expected that some
                    kind of a leader would gradually emerge from this, who would have the support of
                    all the republics. I think we felt that the process of Yugoslavia becoming an
                    integrated nation was inexorable, inevitable. We were influenced by people who
                    said, “Don't ask me whether I'm a Serb or a Croat, I'm a Yugoslav.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I felt very much that way, that we didn't see these almost
                        cultural fissures that have come up. We thought that perhaps the experience
                        of World War II and all had...well, we were really superimposing the United
                        States's experience on Yugoslavia, I think, in many ways maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, we were also, though, I think, giving weight to practical factors:
                    the Slovenes needed a market, and there it was in Serbia; the Serbs needed some
                    components from more developed regions, and the Slovenes and Croats could
                    provide that. Alone these republics, we were wont to feel, would have had a heck
                    of a tough time. We felt that gradually these old animosities and nationalist
                    feelings would wear away. And then, you remember, there was this resurgence of
                    Croatian nationalism, in Tito's day, that he squashed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we didn't see any real problem from the Albanian
                        minority at that time, did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In Kosovo?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kosovo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, it took Milosevic to awaken the interests of the Serbs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Milosevic is the present authoritarian leader of
                        Serbia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it took him to awaken the interests of Serbs in recovering this
                    great battleground, this great scene of so many Serbian glories. Of course, all
                    of these feelings emerge as soon as the Communist Party is removed, this great
                    crust that keeps feelings down. And, in effect, there was a system. It was a
                    horribly inefficient system, but things ran. Well, as soon as that crust is
                    removed and you get an active prime minister like Markovic, who wants to go
                    about reforming instantly and bring some efficiency into the economy—a free
                    market, close down the factories that aren't making money, that sort of
                    thing—that then gives rise to all kinds of not only nationalist feelings but
                    arguments among the republics on economic matters and disagreements with the
                    federal government: we can't afford all of these unemployed workers, we don't
                    want these fine plants to shut down. And so I think, as Yugoslav officials today
                    are wont to say, it was almost inevitable that once you gave them an
                    opportunity, the people would bring these feelings to the surface and there
                    would be clashes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you moved to Sofia as deputy chief of mission,
                        and you were there from '63 to '65. How did that come about? You weren't in
                        Yugoslavia very long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, that was the result of Eugenie Anderson's selection. She came
                    through Belgrade, and she and I worked together on something. We had a legation
                    in Sofia then, you know, it was one of our last legations, and Eugenie was the
                    minister to Bulgaria. She was then looking for a new DCM because Charlie Stefan
                    was finishing his tour. So she asked me if I'd like to take the job, and I
                    jumped at the chance.</p>
                <p>Eugenie had a great public relations orientation; she liked to shake hands and to
                    get out and around. Of course, Bulgaria is a very difficult place to do that,
                    but Eugenie nonetheless tried. She dressed very beautifully. Both in terms of
                    her personality and intelligence but also her appearance, she spoke well for the
                    USA as obviously a prosperous woman. She and her USIA guy, a guy named Alex
                    Bloomfield, would pile into her Cadillac and just shoot off for a day visiting
                    different people, not with prearranged appointments necessarily, but going into
                    the marketplace, and the mobs would descend around this huge Cadillac and
                    Eugenie would shake hands and, through Alex Bloomfield who spoke excellent
                    Bulgarian, she would tell everybody how the U.S. only wanted friendship with
                    Bulgaria and that we hoped there would be some exchanges eventually, but the
                    Bulgarian government wasn't doing much on that. And she'd do that until the
                    secret police would sort of muscle her along. She liked to do that, and she left
                    the business of dealing with the government to me, so I was the one that went
                    around and delivered demarches at government ministries.</p>
                <p>And at that time, the U.S. desk officer in the Bulgarian government (I guess he
                    handled other countries in addition to the U.S.) didn't speak English, so the
                    whole thing had to be conducted in Bulgarian. My Bulgarian was not very good.
                    They decided that I could convert from the Polish and the Serbo- Croatian that I
                    knew to Bulgarian without going through FSI, so it was rather rocky. I remember
                    coming back, and Eugenie would say, “Well, what did he say?”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>And I'd say, well, he said thus and so and so and so.</p>
                <p>And Eugenie would say, “My gosh, are you sure he did?”</p>
                <p>And I'd say, “(um, er) Yes, I'm sure.”</p>
                <p>And she'd say, “Well then, put it in a telegram, the department has got to know
                    about this!”</p>
                <p>I thought at that time I was a pretty weak reed to lean on.</p>
                <p>That tour was generally, I would say, relative to some of my other tours, dull,
                    because contacts with the Bulgarian population were all but impossible. We came
                    to know a few doctors because there were international medical conferences in
                    town. But one doctor that we came to know and had to our house for dinner was
                    subsequently tried as a spy and strung up. There was just damn little contact,
                    even with government people or press people. They just weren't interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the United States per se had very little interest in
                        Bulgaria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I wouldn't say that, Stu, I think we wanted to warm- up relations. In
                    those days, we were trying to build bridges, you remember. I remember, as DCM,
                    urging that we arrange what we called basket talks with the Bulgarians, on a
                    variety of subjects, to try to improve relations—talk about a consular
                    agreement, and talk about beefing up exchanges. We tried on a number occasions
                    to get the Bulgarian government interested in accepting some nice exchange
                    offers. I remember one was with the Columbia Medical School, an internship.
                    Absolutely no political connotation at all. But the Bulgarian reaction was,
                    “Well, why are you offering us this?”</p>
                <p>And we'd say, “Well, just to develop relations.”</p>
                <p>And the official would look at you sort of as if to say that's a likely story!
                    And they'd turn it down.</p>
                <p>So I think we tried.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>One of the maddening things the Bulgarians would do was when an American
                    delegation came, let's say, for some kind of an international medical
                    conference, they would invite our doctors to a briefing and they would say, “You
                    know, it's really unfortunate that our relations are so poor. It's the result of
                    your legation here, they just don't seem interested in doing anything. We've
                    proposed a number of initiatives.” And the doctors often would believe that.
                    They'd come around and say, “Why don't you guys try? Get off the dime.” And
                    maybe I had just come back from my third effort to interest somebody in taking
                    this Columbia internship. The Bulgarians really had tremendous fear of the USA.
                    They were not interested in us at all.</p>
                <p>On two or maybe three occasions, the embassy was under siege by mobs of
                    Communists. We were involved in Vietnam at the time. The occasion was usually
                    some alleged U.S. atrocity in Southeast Asia, like bombing Cambodia or
                    something.</p>
                <p>These were quite frightening occasions, particularly for me, because I was the
                    charg� d'affaires at the time of at least two of them. Eugenie was out in
                    Western Europe at those times. They were frightening because I was worried that
                    these mobs would set fire to the post. They always broke windows and started
                    climbing into the windows. And we had the whole embassy staff to protect. We
                    would be up on the top floor. The locals would have been sent home, but most of
                    the embassy staff was there, because many of us lived there, and they were sort
                    of cowering in a corner while rocks rained through the windows into the offices
                    of the embassy. And, as soon as I could, I would have to try to get out the
                    front door of the embassy, pushing against this surging crowd, and make my way
                    through the crowd, with all sorts of taunts and insults and being spat upon, to
                    the Foreign Ministry, which was just across the way.</p>
                <p>And I would see a man named Bashev, who was the foreign minister, a really
                    sinister, silent man who had very little to say. And the pretext for these
                    things was always the same. Of course, the government always claimed: We had
                    nothing to do with it, it's just an outburst of sentiment on behalf of our
                    youth. But they would then say, “But, Mr. Johnson, a tip for you would be to
                    close down that window you have where you display photographs that are sent to
                    you from Washington, photographs that are propaganda. We know they aren't true,
                    and it infuriates our people. Will you please close it down?”</p>
                <p>And my answer was always the same, “This is our building and that's our window
                    and we aren't going to close it down. And if you're going to make it impossible
                    for us to operate, then we'll have to close this post.” Nobody ever really
                    thought of doing that, but I had to reply in fairly tough terms with them.</p>
                <p>This happened two or three times while I was there. On one occasion, all the cars
                    in front of the embassy were turned over and bashed. I got them to pay for the
                    repairs to mine eventually.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the Bulgarian Communists acting as a Bulgarian
                        Communist regime rather than at the instigation of the Soviets? They might
                        have been marching in step, but was this coming from them, or did you feel
                        they were looking over their shoulder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I had the feeling maybe they were doing what they thought the Soviets
                    would want them to do, but I don't think Moscow actually asked them to besiege
                    the U.S. embassy. In fact, I think eventually Moscow developed some concerns
                    that this sort of thing could get out of hand. And, you remember, it was turned
                    off, just suddenly, and there weren't any more. No, I think the Bulgarians felt
                    that this was a kind of a show of their loyalty, of their support for Moscow's
                    position.</p>
                <p>And so, if I woke up in the morning and heard BBC describing some brand new
                    extension of the war in Southeast Asia, I'd have to tell our security officer,
                    and splice the main brace, and get ready.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Sofia in 1965 and came back, and I have you
                        going to United Nations Affairs for about four years. That must have been a
                        fascinating period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was fun. I liked it. I went there, again, because of Eugenie
                    Anderson. She was assigned as one of the ambassadors to the U.N. Her specific
                    responsibility was with the colonies of the world, the countries of the areas
                    that were supposedly striving for independence. And this included the Trust
                    Territories that the U.S. administered in the Pacific, as well as places like
                    French Somaliland and Equatorial Guinea and even, of course, the anti-apartheid
                    freedom fighters in South Africa. This was Eugenie's job.</p>
                <p>She felt, and I think accurately, that there was not a lot of U.S. interest
                    involved in these issues, that they weren't worth a great deal of time. Except
                    for the Trust Territories. Eugenie felt very strongly about the Trust
                    Territories and felt that something had to be done, that we couldn't
                    indefinitely go on administering these territories without giving them some
                    measure of self-determination. She was a real crusader.</p>
                <p>But as for the rest of this, the Committee on Decolonization, they called it,
                    also known as the Committee of Twenty-Four, she rarely went to these meetings.
                    And, since the U.S. was a member, I, most of the time, would take her place.</p>
                <p>And one fortunate thing about this role in the U.N. mission was that I was able
                    to sit behind the sign and represent the U.S. in most of the gatherings on
                    “decolonization” that took place at the United Nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>On most issues when a meeting was scheduled, guys would come up from Washington,
                    with bulging briefcases, and sort of bump the U.S. U.N. officer aside, and say
                    don't worry about this, we'll ask you for advice when we need it, we're taking
                    this over. But the Committee of Twenty-Four decolonization proceedings were so
                    grimy and repetitive, and there was so little U.S. concern in them, that
                    Washington was prepared, or happy enough, to have me take it over. And I got...I
                    forget whether it was a Superior Service Award, one of those awards, for the way
                    that I defended U.S. interests. Actually, the Department gave me the award out
                    of gratitude because I relieved it of the need to bother with this drudgery.</p>
                <p>This committee, of course, is bad news for the USA, because our positions were,
                    by and large, fairly conservative on these decolonization issues.</p>
                <p>The committee took to the road every year and visited Africa, because that's
                    where most of these freedom-fighters were, and the committee felt it was its job
                    to assure these freedom-fighters of the support of the United Nations. Really
                    that did them a disfavor in a way, I think, because they went away thinking the
                    UN was going to do something for them, and it never did. But it was also an
                    occasion to hear first-hand from these freedom-fighters about their plans and
                    problems.</p>
                <p>The U.S. delegation, we were kind of like trained bears, led into these hotbeds
                    of anti-imperialism by the Committee of Twenty-Four, which was always chaired by
                    a radical, maybe a Tanzanian, and we would sit there and take all kinds of
                    abuse.</p>
                <p>But it was good training for me, and in a way it was interesting—sticks and
                    stones and that sort of thing. And I had some friends in the Committee of
                    Twenty-Four, including the Yugoslav.</p>
                <p>I was very often attacked by the Soviet delegation or the Czech delegate as well
                    as the Tanzanian and some of the other radical Africans. And they would change
                    the subject to lambaste the US. We'd be talking, let's say, about independence
                    for French Somaliland, and I was allowing myself maybe to doze a bit, when all
                    of a sudden, the Czech would go (clink, clink, clink, clink, on his glass) “Mr.
                    Chairman.”</p>
                <p>And the chairman would interrupt the speaker and say, “Yes, I recognize the
                    delegate from Czechoslovakia.”</p>
                <p>And he would say, “What the distinguished delegate from France has said about
                    French Somaliland reminds me of aggression in the Virgin Islands by the United
                    States. I have here an article that I have just been reading about how the
                    United States has disbanded the parliament of the Virgin Islands, and this is
                    just another example of U.S. imperialism.”</p>
                <p>And I would have to go (clink, clink, clink) “We're departing from the subject,
                    and I reserve a right of reply!”</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I would then go to the telephone and call down to Washington and find out what
                    had happened in the Virgin Islands and draft a reply.</p>
                <p>It kept one of the edge of one's chair. As did the fact that all these
                    proceedings were on closed-circuit TV in UNP in the Department. Often, after I'd
                    made a speech, I would feel a tap on my shoulder, a messenger telling me I had a
                    phone call, (one time it was Joe Sisco, the assistant secretary for the UN) and
                    the question would be: “Why did you say that? Don't you think that that could
                    have some negative impact on our bilateral relations?” So that kept me on my
                    toes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever given ammunition, for example, to raise the
                        oppression of the Russians on Georgia or on all these other Baltic
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Baltic States especially. Yes, oh, yes, that was part of the
                    standard invective...there was an awful lot of shadow boxing. When the Czechs
                    got after us about the Virgin Islands, more particularly Puerto Rico, that was
                    our really sensitive point, we would always retaliate by saying how about the
                    Baltic States? And that would get them furious. And Shakov, the Soviet delegate,
                    and I would meet thereafter in the delegates' lounge and have a whiskey together
                    and talk about in a rather friendly way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get any delegation of that to go down to
                        Puerto Rico, to take a look and to talk to people? Or did we just want the
                        U.N. to keep their hands off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't think we did that. We didn't want the U.N. in on it.</p>
                <p>The Committee on Decolonization is against any colony, under any circumstances.
                    They feel that everyone has the right to freedom and independence,
                    self-determination. Even the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which is a reef off the
                    coast of Australia that's administered by Australia. I remember they came up
                    regularly on the agenda of the Committee of Twenty- Four. They'd ask the
                    Australians: What are you doing to bring independence to the (some six hundred
                    and fifty) inhabitants of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands? And the Australians would
                    say this is just patent nonsense.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, I think we were afraid that if we invited the Committee of
                    Twenty-Four to go to Puerto Rico, they would plump simply for independence. And,
                    of course, we had regular votes taken, plebiscites of sorts, with independence
                    one of the options, the existing commonwealth status another, statehood a third
                    option, and the vote was usually fairly heavily in favor of continuing
                    commonwealth status.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you working rather strictly this whole time on this
                        colonization subject?</hi>

                <p>JOHNSON: Solely, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you must have become quite an expert on

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. Yes, I can still tell you what the various national elements are in
                    Equatorial Guinea, Spanish Guinea, which was quite a complicated set up.</p>
                <p>I was there for about two years, Stu, and then I went to the Senior Seminar,
                    which was a tremendous experience for me. It exposed me to my own country for
                    really the first time in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's equivalent to the military War College in a way.
                        It's at a senior level and it's a selected group of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. It differs from the War College, I think, in that it spends more
                    time on the U.S. domestic scene, because it's designed to take officers who've
                    been overseas for a long time and teach them what's been going on in the USA
                    while they've been gone. Whereas the War College and the various other senior
                    training things focus more on international politics and strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I found it a tremendous year. I had it about five or
                        six years later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was one of the best years I've ever spent; I loved it.</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was the political counselor. That was something I arranged while I was
                    in Washington. I remember they told us, and they perhaps told you when you were
                    in the Senior Seminar, you are a hot property and you needn't worry about your
                    assignments from now on...</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Did they tell you this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, and they had no idea what to do with us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, absolutely not the slightest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were told we would be assured of a fine place because
                        we were a selected few, and they had plenty of time to do this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, yes, and they claimed they had plans for us. And then I remember
                    there was a poor guy from the Office of Personnel that had to meet with each of
                    us, and he always took us to lunch at Martin's. And that was a very painful
                    luncheon, because, after I had been promised that there were all kinds of
                    goodies ready for me, he would have to tell me, “As of now, Johnson, let me
                    see...there seems to be a vacancy for the assistant political adviser to the US
                    military in D�sseldorf.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, what's at D�sseldorf?”</p>
                <p>“Well, it's the headquarters of the 45th Mess Kit Repair Battalion.”</p>
                <p>And I'd say, “Well, maybe you can find something else.”</p>
                <p>And I despaired eventually, because it was clear to me that they didn't have
                    anything particular in mind. Fortunately, I had a good friend, still a very
                    close friend of mine, Doug Hartley, who was in ARA Personnel, and he said,
                    “You're going on your Senior Seminar tour down in South America, why don't you
                    stop off in Rio, they're looking for a political counselor.” And I did, and I
                    got the job.</p>
                <p>And I arrived at a very interesting time. Elbrick had just then been
                    kidnapped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Burke Elbrick, who... And this was a brand new
                        thing really for the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was, I think, the second kidnapping. The first one was in the
                    DR, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how you saw it, and how the embassy and
                        everybody reacted on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: At that time, of course, our policy toward this sort of thing was just
                    in its infancy. And the sole reaction was to order the Brazilians to do
                    everything within their power to get our ambassador back. The terrorists had
                    demanded the release of...I think it was sixteen, really tough terrorists,
                    people with bomb-throwing records who had been caught and were in prison. And
                    the Brazilians swallowed this. They said, “This is going to be tough for us, and
                    it's just going to mean more terrorism in this country if we let these
                    so-and-so's go. They're just going to go up to Cuba, where we have to fly them,
                    and then they'll be brought back in again in a few months.” And it turned out
                    they were right—these guys showed up again. But, sure, they gradually released
                    them all. It took a while.But we really rode them on it. I remember my boss
                    would say, “Well, Texeira is still in prison up in Recife, and nothing has been
                    done to turn him over for release.” And so I'd call up the Brazilian Foreign
                    Office and say, “What in the hell are you doing? After all, we've got to get
                    these sixteen mothers out of the country, and Texeira hasn't even been moved.”
                    And they were terribly patient. But they wanted to get Elbrick back alive,
                    too.</p>
                <p>We didn't negotiate with the kidnappers, and anyway they didn't really identify
                    themselves, but they sent us messages through this very fine Rio newspaper, the
                    Jornal do Brasil, which was very helpful in getting Elbrick out.</p>
                <p>Finally, these sixteen were sent off to Cuba, and the kidnappers turned Elbrick
                    loose.</p>
                <p>It was soon after that, that he went back to Washington to be checked over, and
                    he developed a circulation problem, which, as far as I know, had no relationship
                    at all to his incarceration. And shortly thereafter, he lost both legs. Very
                    fine man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very fine man. A great professional.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Excellent...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your major concerns other than, obviously,
                        dealing with the kidnapping? In the first place, Rio was still the capital
                        in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The military was still in control, had been for several years, and any
                    sort of expression of liberal sentiment in politics were suppressed. There was
                    an opposition party, but it really wasn't very liberal. And student
                    organizations were very thoroughly prohibited. Many of the terrorists were
                    themselves kids rather than pros. They were college kids who had liberal
                    aspirations and were not necessarily Marxists or anarchists or anything, but
                    they just resented the pressure that the military regime was keeping on, and
                    partly it was this refusal to allow them to form liberal organizations or any
                    kind of student groups that led them to violence. So the political atmosphere
                    was quite tense.</p>
                <p>The U.S. government's position was to distance itself from this military
                    government. There were reports, and I think fairly well substantiated, that the
                    military was even torturing these young people in order to get word of their
                    plans. And sometimes they would say, “Sure, but that's to protect you diplomats,
                    to find out what the terrorists have in mind.” But, in any case, our relations
                    with the Brazilian government were not very close then, for human rights
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>We had an interesting reporting situation when I arrived. We had in the Embassy
                    an army attach� who had wonderful contacts with the president of Brazil, M�dici.
                    They respected one another for their military know-how and experience. The
                    attach� had regular meetings with the very top levels in the Brazilian
                    government, and even civilians, like the minister for foreign affairs, knew him,
                    because he got along well with Brazil's president. He was welcome anytime and
                    they would talk quite candidly with him. Well, you can imagine being a political
                    counselor responsible for political reporting in a country ruled by the
                    military, with this guy sending back military attach� reports with hot
                    information from his top level sources. The attach� was happy enough to put
                    “State Department Distribution” down on them. But it made it hard for the
                    political section to find a niche. And, when I arrived, the political section
                    just wasn't doing any reporting, because Washington really didn't want anything
                    out of the Embassy that was not vetted by the attach�—and for fairly good
                    reasons. I mean, if you were trying to say what the Brazilian leadership was
                    thinking, not to clear it with the attach� was looked upon, at least by
                    Washington, as a great oversight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was following really, maybe several times removed, in
                        the footsteps of Vernon Walters, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, several steps removed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walters had exactly the same type of relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Exactly.</p>
                <p>The attach� would not clear anything that my political section had written that
                    had accusatory tones. He felt that he understood why the Brazilian government
                    did what it did.</p>
                <p>My idea was that, at all costs, we had to do some reporting—what is a political
                    section for? So we would send in things for a time with the attach�'s dissent
                    attached, and Ambassador Elbrick would sign them...while he was there; he wasn't
                    there for an awfully long time. And the attach� and I got along quite well—we
                    agreed to disagree on various things— but we'd turn in a fairly good volume of
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>I found I had quite a few junior officers, very good and very bright guys, but
                    they wanted to spread all over town making contacts, particularly with the
                    liberal groups, which was fine, the Embassy encouraged that. They wanted to
                    spend all their time out and around meeting people, and I couldn't get them to
                    come in, sit down, and put some of this stuff on paper.</p>
                <p>I'd ask them, “What happened? What did so and so tell you?”</p>
                <p>And they'd give me a bit of a rundown.</p>
                <p>And I'd say, “That sounds terribly interesting. Would you please make a
                    memorandum of conversation, and we'll shoot this right back to the Department,
                    we'll send a telegram.”</p>
                <p>“Well, Dick, I've got an appointment with thus and so this afternoon, and I don't
                    know whether I'm going to get around to it.”</p>
                <p>The only bad efficiency report I've ever written, really bad, on someone on my
                    staff was this guy who absolutely refused to play a role as a reporting
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is somewhat a reflection of this era, of not
                        quite seeing the connection between “doing their thing” and representing the
                        United States in getting that knowledge back into the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I think so. In a way, this was perhaps the early evidencing of the
                    Vietnam generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I had somewhat the same thing, not seeing that this
                        was a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, yes. And I found also, as a political counselor and as DCM, a
                    reluctance to report, on the part of senior officers. And, there, it was because
                    they didn't want to be caught off base. I can think of a couple of guys that
                    were this way. They'd say, “Dick, let's wait till the dust settles before we
                    report this cabinet shift. Who knows what it's going to mean. We've got to wait
                    till more returns are in, and then we can give Washington some pretty good
                    analysis.” I was working for Mac Toon on one of these occasions, and Mac was
                    very insistent on quick...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, he was ambassador in Belgrade at the time. He was very insistent on
                    quick reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're not talking about Belgrade, we're still
                        talking about Rio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, I'm talking here mostly about other posts that I've been at where
                    there was a reluctance to report. But in the latter case it was for a different
                    reason: it was caution and, because you can't send things back without some
                    Embassy comments, fear of making an interpretation and being caught wrong. Well,
                    I had the feeling that when something happened, like a cabinet reshuffle,
                    Washington was interested right away, immediately. They got the word even before
                    our Embassy telegram could get back, from press services, and the first question
                    that morning when business opened was: “Well, what does the Embassy think about
                    it?” And we needn't have thought that a decision was going to rest solely on our
                    interpretation— Washington had the CIA and many other sources—but they wanted to
                    know the Embassy's thoughts immediately. And if we weren't there until two or
                    three days later, it was a real, I think, omission by the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Rio, were you getting any push from, say,
                        the Brazilian desk about, you know, tell us what's going on? I mean, were
                        they uncomfortable about this sort of military cast to our reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, they had been uncomfortable. But I don't think the
                    attach�'s reporting was particularly slanted, although he was more understanding
                    of what the military regime was trying to do than the rest of the embassy. But
                    you're quite right, the State Department was anxious to get Embassy reporting.
                    And that was why I devised this business of sending things in with the attach�'s
                    separate comments, and we reported on what our contacts thought about the
                    military government, and reported occasionally in very critical vein.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the problem of being concerned that you have a
                        government with which we can “do business,” but if you start reporting on it
                        in a critical way, talking about, say, torturing or that sort of thing, and
                        you know that when it gets back to Washington this could fall into the hands
                        of people who are just opposed to our doing anything, and really not lead
                        anywhere but just basically harm our relations without particularly changing
                        the course of events, say, regarding torturing? In other words, did you find
                        that you had to be careful about your reporting because this could be used
                        not only as a picture of what was happening in a country, but could be used
                        against our relations with that country by other people in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I don't think we were that concerned really about the impact on our
                    relations with Brazil. We felt the department had the right to get the full
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find dealing with the Foreign Ministry?
                        Was it easy to deal with? How did they feel about Americans, the
                        professionals in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Oh, we had many good friends in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. We liked
                    them. And personally they were quite warm. And they were prepared to see us when
                    we came over to their offices, but, I would say, not receptive to U.S.
                    suggestions as to what we hoped the Brazilians would do, for instance, at the
                    U.N. I'd go over and speak my piece, and quite often the under secretary would
                    say, “Thank you very much for coming by. I appreciate your telling us what your
                    position is.”</p>
                <p>And I'd say, “Yeah, well, what do you think about it? What's your position?”</p>
                <p>And he'd say, “Our position has not as yet been determined, Dick. We'll be in
                    touch with you later.”</p>
                <p>Kind of a don't-call-us-we'll-call-you. And very often, having gotten our
                    position, they would draft as a position the exact opposite, because they wanted
                    to be on the side of the developing countries, the anti-imperialists, the
                    nonaligned. So, at one point, I told Ambassador Crimmins that I thought we were
                    having a negative result trying to get the Brazilians to go along with us.</p>
                <p>The foreign minister at the time, I really had trouble with. He was, I think, in
                    many ways very bitter about the U.S. I would go to see him, usually with a
                    visitor from Washington. And the foreign minister would proceed to tell the
                    visitor from Washington what a great democracy Brazil was in comparison with the
                    U.S., and how there is no racial discrimination in Brazil, how it has always
                    been a great place for the mingling of the races, for centuries the Portuguese
                    have always married blacks, or at least had black children. (That's true,
                    there's a great deal of inter...I wouldn't say marriage but at least intercourse
                    between the Portuguese and all the others that were there.) And he would draw a
                    very, of course, negative picture of racial discrimination in the States and
                    other aspects of U.S. life that I just didn't feel I could allow to sit.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Perhaps I shouldn't have done this, because the interview was really for the
                    Washington visitor, but I felt obliged to tell him that I thought all countries
                    had some problems in this regard. And certainly if you go to the Rio Country
                    Club, you aren't going to see anybody who is even remotely tan. It's an
                    absolutely, totally white club. And that at least in the US we recognized the
                    problem, and clubs that have a no-black admission policy are gradually being
                    beaten down. I don't see in Brazil any admission that there's a problem.</p>
                <p>Well, that took up a good part of the discussion. He would launch in on these
                    things because he really didn't want to hear what the American visitor had to
                    say. He didn't want to have to answer any questions. He wanted to monopolize the
                    meeting. And he'd start off by assuming that we had nothing particular to say
                    and that he could fill the half hour allotted. And after a half hour, while I
                    was right in the middle of my response about racial discrimination—he would go
                    on so that I'd have to start talking right on top of him—in the middle of this,
                    somebody would take a look at their watch and say, “Your time's up. The minister
                    has another appointment.”</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick, does that pretty well cover the Rio side, would you

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Sure.</p>

                        You were there from '71 until about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Seventy-one until I went to Brasilia in '74.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? Why all of a sudden were you off to
                        Belgrade again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, I was the political counselor in Rio, and they were looking for a
                    DCM in Belgrade. That was, of course, a boost up for me. The ambassador then was
                    Leonhart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he had a blowup with his DCM.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, he had a problem with his DCM and they needed a new DCM quickly,
                    preferably one with some experience and one who could try to defuse disputes.
                    And I guess the way I'd gotten around this Army-State Department dispute within
                    the Embassy in Rio made me plausible for this job. I'm not sure whose
                    recommendation it was, but I was happy to get the job because it meant a boost
                    to minister counselor level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you served under two rather active ambassadors:
                        William Leonhart and then Mac Toon, but they were quite dissimilar, weren't
                        they? How did you find their style of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I would say they were dissimilar in one important respect.
                    Ambassador Leonhart was very concerned about detail; he thought most detail had
                    some broader implications. I remember arriving and being told by the
                    administrative officer that morale was low because the swimming pool hadn't been
                    opened and it was already July.The swimming pool committee had not been
                    appointed. I had hoped to handle that detail quickly for the Ambassador, but I
                    discovered that he was concerned about late-hour noise disturbing the community.
                    He saw this as part of our profile in Yugoslavia generally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm amused, because I was the head of the swimming pool
                        committee when it first opened up, and I know that became a bone of
                        contention because the swimming pool made some noise for the ambassador's
                        wife when she took her afternoon nap.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Which ambassador was that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Elbrick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Elbrick, yes. Of course, in Yugoslavia the pool was quite removed from
                    the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was removed. It wasn't that bad, but it was a problem.
                        It was an essential (there was very little to do there), and it was a very
                        important element to them. JOHNSON: There was a tendency for things to pile
                        up on Ambassador Leonhart's desk. I think his forte was in speech-making. Or
                        answering toasts; that was the only time I really heard him. He was a
                        thoughtful person, and you could be sure when he got up to make a toast it
                        was deliberate and intelligent and thoughtful, he had really thought it
                        through. He made an intervention just three nights ago at a thing I went to,
                        and again it was very different from the interventions others had made and
                        it exactly fit for the occasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Toon was much more brisk, much more military in his style. He saw me as his alter
                    ego. He told me that that's what he wanted me to be, and he said he hoped that I
                    could handle most of his dealings with the staff. Which in a way is good,
                    because you know where you stand and you have some authority. But the problem
                    was that members of our staff I think at times felt that they had a right to see
                    the ambassador, to sit down with him.</p>
                <p>A case in point is when the public affairs officer was putting together his
                    program for the coming year and he had to submit it to Washington. He wanted to
                    be sure that the ambassador had seen it and liked it, and he wanted to discuss
                    it with him in person. And I couldn't blame him.</p>
                <p>But often Mac's reaction would be: “Can't you take care of that? Do I have to see
                    this person? Can't you see him and discuss it?”</p>
                <p>And then if I said, “No, sir, I think he has a right to sit down and talk with
                    you,” Mac would say, “All right, if you say so.” And he was quite gracious with
                    the PAO when he did. But he preferred having everything go through me and if
                    possible for me to shunt things off. And that was generally his style. It was an
                    efficient style, it kept the embassy moving in good shape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main things in our relations with Yugoslavia
                        during this period? This was from '71 to '73ish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Wasn't that when the Krsko nuclear power plant contract was signed? That
                    became a major issue. We were, of course, delighted when Tito gave the green
                    light for the contract to be awarded to Westinghouse. But throughout most of my
                    tour this was under construction, and the Yugoslavs were concerned that
                    Westinghouse was not using enough Yugoslav material, not training enough
                    Yugoslavs, not using enough Yugoslav engineers. And I was called in, one of my
                    last responsibilities, when I was charg� d'affaires just before I left, and they
                    delivered a stiff demarche, telling us to get Westinghouse to live up to the
                    terms of the agreement. I think they subsequently did, and it's a good,
                    functioning, efficient plant.</p>
                <p>But the fact that that is an issue that sticks out in my mind indicates how
                    unruffled and uniformly good our relations were. Much, much fewer incidents than
                    in our relations, say, with our NATO allies.</p>
                <p>Oh, they picked up a U.S. official of Yugoslav origin visiting from Western
                    Europe and put him in prison overnight. He had gone back to his hometown, as I
                    recall, and was preaching sort of anti-government, anti-Tito sentiments, and so
                    they picked him up and put him in prison. Well, this resulted in tremendous
                    screams. I mean, you don't put in prison an official of another government. But
                    as soon as I went around to the Foreign Ministry, they let him go.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was somebody who was originally born in
                        Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, he was a U.S. official, U.S. citizen, but of Yugoslav origin.</p>
                <p>Oh, there were other arrests of U.S. citizens, but I don't remember any major
                    incidents then in our relations, do you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I was out of there then, but there was nothing very
                        major happening. How did we view, from Yugoslavia at that point, the
                        Soviets? Did we consider that Yugoslavia was a country that was threatened
                        by the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Sure, and how! And that was in part the reason for our tremendously
                    close relations with Yugoslavia. When they told us they didn't want our
                    assistance, we didn't force it on them, but in many other ways, ever since then,
                    right up to this date we've done everything we could to help them economically:
                    Ex-Im Bank loans, OPIC programs, very generous duty-free treatment under GSP,
                    CCC credits, every way you can think of helping a country economically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose overriding our concern was that if Yugoslavia
                        collapsed, there would be a tremendous destabilizing situation, particularly
                        as regards the Soviet Union, which was still under Brezhnev, and we felt it
                        was a rapacious neighbor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, we felt the Soviets would like to get access to the Adriatic, and
                    we knew they had asked the Yugoslavs on several occasions if they could rent a
                    piece of this or that naval base to service their vessels. The Yugoslavs
                    absolutely refused. But that was a very real consideration in our policy toward
                    Yugoslavia. I think, secondly, we wanted the Yugoslav experiment to succeed,
                    because we wanted the world to see that there were possibilities for more
                    liberal forms of socialism. I don't think the Yugoslavs today would say that
                    workers' self- government was a success, but at that time we thought it might
                    succeed and we wanted to do everything we could to help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Belgrade and went back to Bras�lia as

                <p>JOHNSON: In 1974 to '78 I was DCM in Brasilia.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: John Crimmins, bless his heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you find him as a...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I really enjoyed that man. He was just a terrific guy. He saw his job in
                    the broadest sense. He loved people; he liked to relate to them. He liked to get
                    his junior officers in and chat with them about anything, from policy to the
                    fortunes of the Patriots football team.</p>
                <p>I remember one time when John had a telegram from the Department saying: By the
                    end of the day we want your views on a certain subject. And I noticed that one
                    of the junior officers had been in there for a long time, and they were just
                    chatting. And I thought, “I've got to go in and interrupt them. They may be
                    talking about some important aspect of our policies. but he's got this telegram
                    to write, and I'm going to help him get to it.” And so I went in, with some
                    interruption, and as I came in, Crimmins was saying, “I just can't stand the
                    chunky variety of peanut butter! I think the smooth thing is much, much better.
                    Bill, you're all wrong!” He still found time to write a very perceptive
                    telegram.</p>
                <p>And on another occasion, as I saw someone heading out of his huge, long office,
                    Crimmins leapt up from his desk and shouted, “Run out for a pass.” He was a
                    great New England Patriots fan, and he had this football with autographs all
                    over it that was on his window sill, and he grabbed it and flung it the length
                    of his office. This JO made a leaping catch, otherwise he would have broken a
                    picture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our issues with Brazil at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: When I went back, well, Stu, the military government was still there,
                    and there were still reports of tortures. Furthermore, the terrorist threat had
                    subsided tremendously, so that there really was less reason for tight security.
                    The military government was not quite so conservative and doctrinaire, but we
                    still were critical of their human rights record. We were not outspoken about
                    it; we didn't really confront them with it. But when somebody, like Kissinger,
                    would come to Brasilia, he would tell the Brazilians, “We want to talk to you
                    about human rights.” He wouldn't say human rights in Brazil, and the Brazilians
                    would then be able to say, “Oh, yes, let's talk about 'em—human rights all over
                    the world. We oppose apartheid, that's a terrible system.” But human rights in
                    Brazil remains a major issue in our relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>A very dramatic event occurred midway in my tour. A priest was imprisoned by the
                    military in the Recife area because he was in touch with liberal
                    organizations—he may have been in touch with terrorist groups, I don't know, he
                    was a defrocked young American priest. And our Consul general in Recife got word
                    that this guy was in the 4th Army's prison and asked for permission to see him.
                    It was denied for a long time. Finally, he was admitted and he went in and saw
                    this guy, and it was clear why they hadn't wanted him to see him. He showed
                    signs of having been really clobbered. And Rich Brown, the Consul general, sent
                    word on this down to Crimmins. Crimmins was this very forthright, active person,
                    he didn't mince words, and he went rushing over to the Foreign Ministry and told
                    them about this. And, of course, the foreign minister said, “Mr. Ambassador, you
                    are accusing the Brazilian Army of torturing! Do you realize what this means?”
                    And then we heard later that the Brazilians were on the verge of declaring him
                    PNG. But this heightened our determination to report objectively whatever there
                    was, because we were certain that this poor guy had been blasted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? Were we able to get him out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, he was released a bit later. But what made the Foreign Ministry so
                    angry at Crimmins was that he told the press about it right after he came away
                    from the foreign minister. And you could say, well, why would he do that, this
                    was between us and the Brazilian authorities. And that was the position that the
                    Brazilian authorities took. But the American press knew this guy had been
                    imprisoned and that Rich Brown had been trying to see him, so the question about
                    his condition was put to the ambassador, he didn't volunteer it. And had he
                    said, “Well, I don't know, I don't want to say anything, you know, I don't want
                    to imply torture,” and kind of waffled on it, it would have put him and the
                    Department in a bad light later, because this guy went back to the States and
                    was on the Today show, telling about everything that had been done to him. And
                    he praised the ambassador for his forthright activity.</p>
                <p>That brought our relations with Brazil really to an all- time low point. As did
                    the evidence that we thought they were trying to develop a full nuclear cycle
                    capacity. We were very concerned about the dissemination of nuclear capacity
                    around the world, and we didn't want the Brazilians to get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's still an issue, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It still is, to some extent, yes.</p>
                <p>Another issue was this...what we suspected was an interest on the part of the
                    Brazilians in developing a full nuclear capacity. Not necessarily a capacity to
                    build a bomb; we didn't have any evidence that they were determined to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had no real enemies, did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Maybe you're right. Maybe there was no reason for them to want to build
                    a bomb. They claimed they wanted the full cycle because they didn't want to have
                    to buy uranium for their power plant use. But we didn't want them to get the
                    reprocessing facilities, because we felt that that just expands the potential
                    around the world for bomb-building, the same way we talk about the Pakistanis
                    and the Israelis and others. And that was, I would say, a number two issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Brasilia work? I mean, this was fairly new as a
                        capital, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And for the Embassy to operate there, did you find that
                        everybody was running back and forth to Rio? Was it sort of a difficult life
                        to be in Brasilia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the question of relations between the US posts in Rio and Brasilia
                    at the start was a big question. Crimmins was an activist, he liked to feel that
                    he had all the levers of control in his hands. He was a guy that wanted to run
                    the show. He didn't want to have a large staff in Rio, but we left behind a
                    fair-sized staff because there were some Brazilian government agencies left
                    behind there, at least temporarily. So we had a good-sized political and
                    economic staff there, and Crimmins insisted that those staff members be formally
                    made part of the Embassy in Brasilia. And, of course, our CONGEN in Rio didn't
                    think very highly of that. He didn't like having people in his building who were
                    not subject to his supervision, and this caused a fair amount of friction. And
                    everything that Rio generated in political or economic reporting had to be sent
                    to Brasilia to be checked out. That was one of the problems, but it didn't last
                    forever.</p>
                <p>And there wasn't a tremendous amount of running back and forth between Brasilia
                    and Rio, because it's a two-days' drive, it's a long distance, and by air it was
                    quite expensive. So we had a tendency to be isolated in Brasilia. And you are
                    isolated, in what was then a rather small town of maybe a quarter of a million,
                    on this high plain with nothing but sagebrush around for hundreds of miles.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>There is, of course, beautiful architecture in the town. It's been described as
                    having all of the color and excitement of a great international exposition...the
                    day after closing. And that's what it reminded me of—these beautiful buildings,
                    with tremendous open spaces, but no life visible. It was designed by a Marxist
                    town planner. He laid out the town, and the architect was Niemeyer, who himself
                    was a Socialist. And the idea was to build a town that had absolutely no
                    gradations of wealth, where everybody lived the same way and there were no rich
                    and no poor. So they had this series of apartment complexes, huge complexes, and
                    each one was allowed to have a certain ration of stores. In each complex there'd
                    be a merceria, where you got thread and cloth, and there'd be a hardware store
                    and a grocery store and a church and one club. Life was supposed to center in
                    this complex. And the assistant ministers for foreign affairs were supposed to
                    live there right alongside of the elevator operators in the Foreign Ministry. It
                    was laid out to be a town with no center, thus there were these units. So there
                    was no heart. Most Mediterranean Portuguese-type cities have wonderful streets
                    where there's a “corso” with opportunities for socializing all the time, and
                    there are coffee shops where life gathers. Well, I haven't been back to Brasilia
                    for a long time, but there certainly then was no center of the town. There was
                    no life in the town. There weren't even sidewalks. The streets were made in a
                    supposedly very modern style, so that people could drive through the town
                    without even slowing down. There were no stop lights, there were only grade
                    separations, and you could speed from one end of Brasilia to the other at 55
                    miles an hour; but you couldn't walk from the Embassy to your house, because
                    you'd take your life in your hands trying to get across one of those highways.
                    It was, in short, a rather dull town.</p>
                <p>But, for Americans, it was wonderful family life. There were lots of swimming
                    pools and tennis courts, and there was even a golf course. You could go out
                    there on a Saturday morning, and look down an empty fairway, there wasn't
                    anybody else playing golf, and play to your heart's content. So, from the
                    standpoint of living conditions, it was great.</p>
                <p>One of the jobs that I liked the best as DCM was my liaison with the Consulates.
                    We then had six of them all over Brazil. And I enjoyed exploring Brazil by bus.
                    I took the bus all the time, much to the displeasure of the Brazilian police.
                    They felt they had to know my whereabouts exactly when I was the charg�
                    d'affaires. So they would either ride on the bus with me, or they'd tell the
                    police at the other end, in Salvador or Bel�m or wherever I was going, to meet
                    me when the bus came in. And this wasn't harassment at all, this was just
                    security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Consulates performed a solid
                        function, because of the size of Brazil you needed these?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Some of them. Take a guy like Rich Brown, our Recife Consul General
                    then, he's a real all-around Foreign Service officer, and he liked to do
                    reporting. And he would send in interpretive reports that were good. And he was
                    quite active with business people, trying to develop U.S. business in the area.
                    Others were more traditional consuls. They felt it was their job to make sure
                    the flag was flown up on the flagpole every morning, that the consulate was
                    opened on time, that the consular section was there ready to receive visitors,
                    and that if someone wanted to see the Consul, there he was behind his desk with
                    the flag.</p>
                <p>And I would ask them, “Do you know the military commander for this area? The
                    military's running this country now.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, I met him at a reception a couple of years ago.”</p>
                <p>“Do you ever go to see him, ask him about what's happening in this region?”</p>
                <p>“Well, no. He wouldn't want to see me. Why should he want to see me? He's a busy
                    man.”</p>
                <p>I was continually riding these guys to get out and around, as I put it, instead
                    of feeling that they were doing enough by showing the flag.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, the Carter administration came in halfway
                        through this time. Did that have any impact particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. One of the highlights of my stay was when President Carter came
                    down on an official visit. I was the charg�. Crimmins had gone, and the new
                    ambassador hadn't reported. He was in Washington, but he was then...I believe it
                    was in connection with the Panama Canal, he was testifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Robert Sayre. He was waiting in Washington, and so I had to make all the
                    arrangements and receive the President and go around with him.</p>
                <p>As I recall making the arrangements, I had some conflicts with the White House.
                    They were concerned particularly about President Carter's image in the US. They
                    wanted footage that would look good on the Today show. One of the things that
                    all visiting chiefs of state did was to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown
                    Soldier. Well, the advance team for the president visited the Tomb and said,
                    “This is no good, Dick. You can't get a crowd around here for the President.
                    This place is too confined. No.”</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, I really do think he has to do this. Please just take this as
                    the Embassy's strong recommendation.” He eventually went through the
                    motions.</p>
                <p>A little later I got something from the White House that said, “You know, the
                    President is a very good friend of the President of Warner Communications, which
                    in turn owns the Cosmos soccer team in the States, and Pele is under contract to
                    Cosmos. We think it'd be a great idea if Pele would give a reception for Jimmy
                    Carter and invite all the street people that he knows, all the sports fans,
                    everybody. He should give it at Canecao.” This is a wonderful dance hall in Rio,
                    a great, big place, covered a couple of city blocks. “Invite everybody in there.
                    Have beer and wine, and Jimmy can make a speech.”</p>
                <p>I said, “We recommend against that kind of a thing. Everybody knows that Pele and
                    Carter don't know each other, and this would be seen as a very faked-up sort of
                    a thing. We can get President Carter together with the man on the street on some
                    other occasions.”</p>
                <p>So we had the feeling that there was a lot of concern, for public image in the
                    US, more concern than we had. Of course, we wanted to be sure he did the correct
                    thing locally, and we were more concerned about that than the White House.</p>
                <p>When he came, we had been informed in advance that the one person (and this is a
                    sign of the Carter administration also) he wanted to meet was Cardinal Arns. Did
                    you ever hear of Arns?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, he was a very liberal, maybe almost Socialist, cardinal in S@o
                    Paulo State. I think he and President Carter had exchanged communications
                    before, and the President had a lot of respect for the cardinal. A very
                    intelligent man, and outspoken, and a real enemy of the military regime. The
                    President wanted to meet with him. We told them in Washington that this wouldn't
                    be well received in Brasilia at all by the Brazilian President, and it could
                    result in Jimmy's not meeting the President. And the White House came back and
                    said, “Well, work it out some way. It's up to you guys.”</p>
                <p>So the political counselor and I worked it up, I thought, quite satisfactorily.
                    Carter was going to Rio, after he left Brasilia, for an informal stay, just a
                    vacation for a couple of days to rest up. And we figured, and correctly, that as
                    long as he saw Arns during that part of his visit, it would be okay. So we
                    arranged a breakfast for him with Arns. And we had arch-conservatives in as
                    well, other people from all walks of political life. But we gave the President a
                    long chance to sit down with Arns and chat with him. We thought that we had
                    resolved the problem that way, and we were quite proud of ourselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>But, as Jimmy left the place where this breakfast was being given, his limousine
                    was pulled up there, and, with some movie cameras and the TV cameras grinding
                    away, he reached for Cardinal Arns, gave him a big squeeze, shoved him into his
                    limousine, and said, “Let's go out to the airplane together.” So there were
                    these pictures, front page, in all the Brazilian newspapers. But it didn't have
                    the tremendous reaction on the part of the Brazilian government that this sort
                    of thing would have had if it had been on his official schedule. They took it in
                    stride.</p>
                <p>But it was fun, of course, going around with the President and meeting with
                    everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Brasilia and then came back to Washington,
                        is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In Washington?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I wanted very much to get an Embassy, and I had been told by various
                    assistant secretaries for Latin American affairs that, having been DCM, minister
                    counselor, and long-time charg� in Brasilia, it was virtually inevitable.</p>
                <p>So they found a job for me, in effect marking time, as director of the office of
                    regional political programs, which was a kind of a basket for all manner of
                    regional things, things that they wanted run on a regional basis that were not
                    economic.</p>
                <p>I remember one of the problems was fisheries, another was labor problems. We had
                    the labor man for ARA; he was in my office. We had military assistance. As far
                    as ARA was concerned, we did it. We were the merchants of death. Or, more often
                    than not, the reverse—we were trying to put the brakes on the Pentagon. Often we
                    had the human rights spokesman for the Department of State arguing with us. If
                    the Hondurans decided they needed a new steering wheel for their weapons
                    carrier, and ordered it, it had to go not only through us, but through the Human
                    Rights Division. And I'd get into all kinds of squabbles over these things. It
                    wasn't a very exciting job.</p>
                <p>I was put up for a couple of Embassies. One of them was Sofia, and the other was
                    Guyana. I was on a State Department short list for these posts, but I never got
                    out of this State Department committee that picks names to send to the White
                    House.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>And I asked Under Secretary Newsom, who was commendably receptive to disappointed
                    Foreign Service officers afterwards why I hadn't, and he said it was because of
                    my age. I was by then fifty-eight. He said, “It would have been impossible for
                    you to have finished a tour of duty as an ambassador anywhere before age sixty
                    (which was the compulsory retirement age then).”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yeah, but I could at least have gone out, as age fifty-eight or
                    fifty-nine.”</p>
                <p>And Newsom said, “These are exactly the arguments that I made on your behalf.
                    But, the White House-oriented folks in the State Department know that Jimmy
                    Carter is all for youth.” (And of course he was.) “And we're supposed to try to
                    appoint young ambassadors. If we appoint old ones, they're kicked aside by the
                    White House and we lose that post.” So...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the dynamics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Those were the dynamics, yeah. In some ways, in retrospect, I'm just as
                    glad that I retired when I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: When I was exactly sixty, in 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had a very good spread as far as where you
                        served, and interesting places in interesting times. I've talked to a good
                        number of people who were ambassadors to some very small places for a couple
                        of years in which they did nothing really. I mean, it was very
                        uninspiring.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, that's true. On the other hand, one feels that to have spent
                    twenty-nine years in the Service and not to have arrived at the point where you
                    got even a teeny little puny Embassy... I feel some regrets, in part, on behalf
                    of Pat, because she was, throughout, a “very good Foreign Service wife.” Of
                    course, she got no credit for it in efficiency reports.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>In Brasilia we had, I believe, four counselors of embassy. Of them, the two most
                    active didn't have their wives at the post. And of course they never told the
                    ambassador they weren't going to bring their wives. They said, “My wife is
                    closing up the house,” or “Our son's graduating from high school,” and excuses
                    like that, but they never came. And the reason, I think, was in part economic:
                    the wives had good jobs, they had their own careers, and they weren't going to
                    come to Brasilia and sit. Well, this meant that Patricia, who had herself given
                    up a Washington career that she was getting more and more engaged in, had a lot
                    more to do in Brasilia than she would have had if there'd been other senior
                    wives at the post. And I feel a certain amount of bitterness on her behalf, that
                    we weren't given this final recognition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course. The system doesn't reward very much. I
                        mean, this comes through very much. You get what you get out of it, but to
                        rely on the system to have a progression that makes sense is to rely on
                        something that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's too mechanical...no, in a sense it's not mechanical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not even mechanical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, that's right. If it were mechanical, it would probably be more just
                    and efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and particularly when you have the political side
                        absorbing, you might say, so much of the upper assignments, particularly the
                        ambassadorial assignments, that it puts increased pressure, where logically
                        a person would move to be an ambassador, up from a career, it wipes a lot of
                        this out. It's very sad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. There are swings, it seems to me. The department at one point in
                    very recent years was favoring management people for Embassies and promoting
                    them fast. Right now...I was talking with a very promising Foreign Service
                    officer whom I know, who, after having been office director, is now going to a
                    rather unimportant DCM spot. And I said, “You should have gotten a small Embassy
                    after this. You did a great job in a tough spot.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, the big jobs now are going to women.” For good reasons...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've been ignored before. But there are these swings,
                        you can't really depend on the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, you can't. You can hope to get promoted fairly honestly on the basis
                    of your performance, but you cannot hope to get an Embassy on the basis of
                    performance. You've got to get it on the basis, within the Department, of who is
                    prepared to really go to bat for you. And if you don't know anybody that is,
                    then you're not going to be nominated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dick, I want to thank you very much. This has been
                        fascinating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Thanks, Stu, I've enjoyed this chat.</p>
